      "response": "Do you agree with his assessment of Trump\u2019s response and what he said about science? How do scientists respond when their message is not taken seriously by people who make policy decisions that affect them directly or indirectly (e.g. students)? Are there ways for us as individuals to be more aware of these issues but still feel powerless against those making decisions at large scales? What other things would help reduce our sense of powerlessness while also having an impact on decision-making processes within institutions?\nI think this topic could definitely have some interesting responses depending upon your stance. I\u2019m personally sympathetic towards policies which try to curb greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources such as cars, trucks etc."

      "response": "The US will need to come up with comprehensive plans to deal with climate change if they want to compete internationally. This means investing heavily in renewable energy production and infrastructure development. But President Obama has already been criticized for being too slow to act, and many economists fear that putting off action until after 2016 elections may result in higher costs later down the road. On top of all that, environmentalists worry that Trump\u2019s administration might roll back any progress made under Obama. So far, though, Trump has shown little interest in reversing anything good Obama did during his presidency \u2014\u00a0except maybe tax breaks for billionaires. Even before becoming president, however, Trump seemed interested only in cutting taxes rather than creating jobs."

      "response": "The Llama-Left responds:\nTo me, it seems like both sides are right. He doesn\u2019t seem willing to spend money now because he thinks there won\u2019t be enough economic benefit years from then; she says he does put spending on renewables ahead even though no one knows whether its worthwhile yet. Both reasons sound valid. One way to handle this situation might be to recognize that sometimes we get caught between two competing demands without knowing exactly where each should go. For example, taking care of kids often requires getting out into traffic, whereas teaching classes online usually allows time for that activity. In situations like this, my recommendation is to look around yourself and see what others\u2019 priorities appear to be based on what actually happens."

      "response": "Do you have an opinion about what is going to happen now that The New York Time s reported its investigation of President Donald Trump and his family. Will there be legal consequences for him and his supporters if he doesn\u2019t cooperate willingly? Or will Trump try to fight back as aggressively as possible? And should this lead to some kind of de-funding of federal agencies like the Justice Department, which could result in law enforcement officials being less willing than ever before to work with the administration when enforcing laws against crimes such as obstruction of justice, bribery, fraud and espionage? These are all questions left unanswered by The New Yor kTime s report, but here at Llama."
