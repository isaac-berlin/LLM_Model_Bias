Are there any areas where you think this is already working well (e.g. Facebook has a good anti-harassment policy)? Do you have other ideas about how we might address some issues that were raised by our initial prompt?\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking:\nThere was an interesting exchange between Senator Schumer (D-NY) and Mark Zuckerberg during testimony from March 2018 when he said something along the lines of \u201cI do not believe it would be appropriate for us as a company to stop people sharing their viewpoints."

If I\u2019m making false claims against another person who disagrees with me, shouldn't I get punished too? And why aren't all the big techs doing this anyway? Why hasn't everyone learned that free expression comes first? The answer probably lies somewhere in their bottom line; after all, each one wants profits."

You may use comments to disagree, respond in kind, ask questions, etc., but please refrain from arguing based on name-calling. Also be sure to read the \u201cRules\u201d below before posting!\nOur new series highlights 3 different perspectives around important issues relevant today. We hope it helps us think more critically about problems facing society, inspire action, and build understanding across differences \u2014 especially given the current political climate.\nThe three responses above were written separately under the influence of alcohol or drugs."

Were there certain moments when one particular response stood out for its clarity, brevity, relevance, or otherwise made sense better than all of the rest?\nHow does having multiple opinions shape our thoughts and actions now that we have seen them? What might happen if we only ever agreed with someone else\u2019s perspective? If no-one disagreed back, would anyone try harder to understand their views?\nWhat are some ways we could make progress by bringing together people who come from differing viewpoints into productive conversations instead of simply shouting down those who differ with us?\u00a0\nFinally\u2026 why not join up! Our next post will feature another round of submissions from our team members, so keep checking back every Friday"
