      "response": "Why does Donald Trump want to build a wall along our southern border? Is his proposal reasonable given America\u2019s needs? Does it help us achieve goals like securing the economy from terrorism? Do we need another government shutdown over the same question? If so, why not have one now rather than later when everyone else has gone home anyway? Can you imagine how difficult life would become without public funds? When considering these questions, remember that there may well be unintended consequences related to every action taken by politicians. So even though building a physical barrier makes sense, it doesn\u2019t necessarily make economic or social sense either."

      "response": "We don't know what the effects will look like until things actually happen \u2014 but based off previous experiences around the world, here's what I predict could happen:\nFirst thing first: A large number of migrants won't get far beyond Mexico because resources aren't available; the Mexican military isn't equipped enough to stop all crossings and its soldiers' wages go straight back into the pockets of corrupt officials who then use those monies to fund other cronies\u2019 political campaigns;\nSecondly, once a few thousand arrive in Tijuana and U.S.-Mexico negotiations fail again after many months, the local police station commander decides he'll just take care of things himself instead of waiting for reinforcements from Washington D.C."

      "response": "What do they suggest about people being able to cross illegally across our border? Are walls an effective way of stopping this? Or are their intended benefits outweighed by negative side-effects such as driving up prices and causing resentment among existing residents living within easy reach of the fence (e.g., if someone cuts through your backyard). And finally...if something can always find ways around laws designed specifically to prevent them doing so - is anything really going to change unless both sides agree on some kind of general agreement governing relations between citizens with different backgrounds / beliefs etc."

Why/why not? \u00a0(11 answers)\nInitial prompt : If you were president would you impose harsher sanctions against China that cause economic damage elsewhere while ignoring Trump\u2019s efforts to make America great again.\u00a0\nResponse: \u00a0 Yes, I\u2019d be toughening my own trade policy towards Beijing even though it might hurt Americans at home and abroad. The idea that we should \u201cdo nothing\u201d during these times when others have taken actions which benefit themselves without considering how it affects us was foolishness long before Donald Trump became President."

      "response": "The US has been too soft on North Korea for far too many years now \u2013 why continue to pretend otherwise? They\u2019ve done all sorts of things like launch missile tests and threaten military action but just sat back waiting until everyone else had blown first and then decided what to do next. It worked well enough over a few decades because no one took notice, but now it must end soon or we will suffer catastrophic consequences from Pyongyang. But instead we\u2019re still pretending everything is okay\u2026..\nChina poses its own set of problems regarding Taiwan and Hong Kong however there appears little appetite amongst Western nations to take any meaningful steps beyond sending diplomatic notes rather than actually putting boots on ground\u2026.This whole situation needs addressing quickly\u2026..or worse yet\u2026."
