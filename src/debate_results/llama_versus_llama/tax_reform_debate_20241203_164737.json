Is there an ideal way of taxing people that exists outside this country (and why)? How could the government improve its revenue stream through taxation without causing too much pain for average citizens?\nReplies: In reply to Initial Prompt:, This topic was active 1 day ago; posts have been received from one other participant.\nIn response to initial prompt:\nTaxation is something most Americans are completely ignorant about so I can't say anything meaningful on it. But here's my take based on some reading and thinking over the last couple days..."

Also, as far as education goes right now, let\u2019s just call bullshit everything Donald Trump says regarding public schools \u2013 he knows nothing about them! And while I agree totally that free-market solutions such as vouchers are problematic and don\u2019t work well enough, those who want to keep private schooling separate must also understand how dangerous these arguments sound when coupled with ignorance around funding options."

The best way for her to get up to speed would be to watch an episode of \"House of Cards\" and see what happens when someone tries to game our financial institutions out of control.\nI\u2019m not sure if you realize this, but there isn\u2019t much of a middle class anymore \u2014 we\u2019ve become part of working poor people whose only option seems to involve getting into debt via student loan repayment schemes or paying off medical bills after having worked hard throughout your life and being denied health insurance due to lack of funds."

What changes might help alleviate this situation? Is there evidence-based research supporting any specific solution(s)? How could colleges use technology to better serve its students?\nIf many graduates never apply themselves academically during their time in secondary school, that doesn\u2019t mean that somehow we magically developed an entire generation of doltish slackers."

      "response": "(1) The current tax code incentivizes Americans to work longer hours, even when those additional hours don\u2019t add value to society. There are several reasons for this including low wages, job insecurity, and a culture of constant competition among employees rather than cooperation. These trends undermine economic progress by keeping productivity down over time \u2013 leading more individuals to believe that working harder results in greater benefits later in life. In turn, these beliefs lead families to devote less resources toward education and retirement saving plans, resulting in diminished prospects overall..."
