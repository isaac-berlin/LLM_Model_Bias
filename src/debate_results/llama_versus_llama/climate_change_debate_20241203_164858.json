      "response": "The government has never imposed such restrictions. It only took a few years for this idea to be rejected by Congress. We have not yet reached that point where people will accept it because we are still fighting our way out from under an enormous debt caused primarily by military expenditures. \u00a0The fact is that the U.S. economy is far too strong right now, with unemployment hovering around its lowest level since the end of World War II. \u00a0\nTo meet your initial prompt about whether or not the United States should institute more stringent environmental laws (e.g., limiting greenhouse gas emissions), I would argue against doing so without first addressing how much energy it takes to maintain current standards and making sure those costs aren\u2019t passed along to consumers."

Is there something missing that could make one side\u2019s position stronger than another's?\nA reader wrote:\nI\u2019m sorry but your whole post seems like just a lot of ad hominem attacks. You claim some unnamed \u201cpeople\u201d want oil drilling in Alaska and then use their opposition as evidence that anyone opposed drilling isn\u2019t really concerned about global warming. That doesn\u2019t work. There were plenty of people protesting the plan before he signed up his son. He knew exactly what was going on \u2014 which makes him no better than Alaskan residents angry over mining companies coming into town."

      "response": "1) The argument is not whether or not we should drill for natural gas (which I don't agree with), it is how important this issue is compared to other things. If our energy needs are more urgent than saving the planet, why would we care if they're causing pollution while doing so? And yes, that does come across badly when you say \"energy\" instead of electricity because an explosion can happen anywhere. But again, that has nothing to do with the main point; it's about us being selfish assholes who refuse to give anything less than all-out war against every living thing under the sun until we've got them all down to screaming numbers."

They\u2019ve never bothered to look beyond themselves. Instead, they have decided to take cheap shots based solely upon assumptions. This is unproductive, silly behavior by both sides, since neither group will ever win without engaging each other thoughtfully and fairly. Both groups need to engage each other directly rather than through insults alone.\u00a0\nYou also show good instincts regarding the dangers of playing fast-and-loose with facts. Your first sentence demonstrates excellent logic \u2013 a fact many Leftists tend to overlook."

Or perhaps some right-wing ideas that really make sense? You\u2019re free to respond as much or little as feels comfortable. We want answers here!\nBut please remember\u2026we ask questions like these only because we genuinely seek clarity around big decisions. So, keep those conversations civil! Also, be sure to read up before responding, especially if something new comes out between now and then\u2026\nWe\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s going on behind closed doors too \u2014 but let\u2019s start with open communication and try to avoid drama wherever possible. Our goal isn\u2019t just to get responses back quickly, though sometimes that may seem necessary."
