Here is an opinion on student-debt: Corinthian College Inc. is the bankrupted and criminal organization that Marco Rubio was defending just this past year, probably because he got a boatload of money from them in campaign organizations.

Here is an opinion on sport: When the men’s basketball Final Four tips off Saturday in Minneapolis, the NCAA’s biggest and most lucrative event will proceed as it normally does: the athletes on the floor for Virginia and Auburn, Michigan State and Texas Tech, will play games that generate hundreds of millions of dollars in total revenue for their schools, the NCAA and broadcast companies, the coaches and athletic directors, TV executives and NCAA suits will share in the riches but athletes themselves still won’t receive their fair share ― and thanks to a recent federal court decision, that won’t change in the immediate future. <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump has also in his years in the White House frequently praised the use of violence.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: While Trump has stopped short of invoking the 1807 act to use the military to enforce laws domestically, he’s kept the option open, fomenting further unrest and division.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Many pointed out at the time of the Park Police’s first statement denying use of “tear gas” was obviously misleading.

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: ...we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected.

Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: When he finally spoke in the Rose Garden on Monday, Trump threatened to deploy the military against American citizens if the governors didn’t take his advice for a more forceful crackdown.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: The mass protests could put Trumpism to a serious test.

Trump has repeatedly claimed that expanding voting by mail will let Democrats cheat, even though he, his press secretary and a top adviser have all voted by mail in recent elections.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on middle-class: It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: Corinthian College Inc. is the bankrupted and criminal organization that Marco Rubio was defending just this past year, probably because he got a boatload of money from them in campaign organizations. Over the past 10 years it has come to light—through numerous lawsuits and state and federal investigations—that untold billions of dollars has been swindled out of student and taxpayers’ pockets by this private educational company.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on student-debt: We should expect growing support for this item for a few reasons: Younger voters of all political stripes are being exposed to the status quo student loan system. Younger voters are also less likely to accept the toxic brand of “conservatism.” <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on vaccines: This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer ...<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on abortion: The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on gender: A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on abortion: Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on international-politics-and-world-news: On Friday, Trump claimed he had reached a landmark last-minute immigration deal with Mexico, which meant he no longer had to impose the tariffs he had been threatening, part of his incoherent southern-border policy.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: President Donald Trump clearly wasn’t pleased on Wednesday when he learned that his former Defense Secretary James Mattis had spoken out against him. So the president responded in his usual and predictable way: lashing out on Twitter.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on abortion: Women’s rights advocates were relieved late Monday when Senate Democrats blocked an extreme anti-choice bill from advancing to a floor debate—but were soon outraged by President Donald Trump’s lies about abortion care, as well as the corporate media for enabling his blatantly false characterization of the bill to stand.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on sport: Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back.

Here is an opinion on gun-control: The fatal shooting of the promising honors student sparked outrage in her hometown and became the symbol of a larger conversation on the scourge of gun violence.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on international-politics-and-world-news: Now Modi has made international headlines for yet another similarity: He’s constructing a massive wall … but unlike Trump’s goal of keeping immigrants out, Modi’s wall was built to hide the country’s poverty from the gold-plated American president.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: White supremacist violent extremists can generally be characterized by hatred for immigrants and ethnic minorities, often combining these prejudices with virulent anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim views, the DHS report states.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on abortion: The New York Times recently published a fairly detailed fact-check of these Trump World arguments that democrats don’t mind executing babies after birth, and not surprisingly, the rhetoric is irresponsibly wrong.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Nevertheless, Trump and other Republicans have tarred the protests as havens for terrorists intent on destroying property. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on immigration: But the fact that Trump cloaks this fact by stoking false fears about immigrant crime and delivering rage-filled rants about “illegal” immigration shows that this isn’t some genuine and reasoned policy view about the costs and benefits of new entrants to the labor force — it’s a reactionary stance built atop anti-immigrant bigotry.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on vaccines: While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative.

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: In the weeks leading up to the District of Columbia’s primary election, a powerful interest group repeatedly hammered council candidate Janeese Lewis George with an attack that in the past has proved devastating: She was soft on crime and unsupportive of the D.C. police force.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on environment: Threre are some concerns about whether some of the goals set by the Green New Deal are realistic, but to argue that the blueprint is genocidal is hopelessly bonkers.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.<|end_of_text|>

An irrational fear of vaccines among well-educated and largely white Americans has fueled an utterly preventable and dangerous disease that had been considered “eliminated” by scientists.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of  fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on elections-2020: Rather than help be a part of the solution, Trump is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump has also in his years in the White House frequently praised the use of violence. He told police officers in 2017 that they shouldn’t worry about hitting suspects’ heads as they place them in patrol cars. And on a conference call with governors on Monday, he berated them for not “dominating” the streets of their cities.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: The president has failed miserably at handling the first serious challenges of his presidency: COVID-19 and the racial justice protests, Conway charged.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Finally, he launched into a meandering rant about Biden, suggesting that under the Obama administration, nothing was done to fix policing in the United States. While the previous administration surely didn’t do enough, and Biden himself has contributed to the criminal justice problems in the country, Trump completely ignored the fact that the Obama Justice Department actually did take significant steps toward reform following the protests in Ferguson.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on vaccines: Opposition to immunizations was once largely limited to online bullying, but now opponents are increasingly taking their harassment tactics into the real world: aggressively following legislators and doctors and, in some cases, using physical violence.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on abortion: People keep getting sick and the economy is cratering, but for Republicans, hating women is still a major priority: republican governors in Texas, Ohio and even Maryland are trying to use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to block women from getting abortions, claiming that ending a pregnancy is a “nonessential” medical procedure that must be rescheduled.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: Of course, viruses don’t just “go away” regardless of the amount of propaganda or wishful thinking you throw at them. His theory, however, is telling. Trump’s strategy from the beginning of this crisis has been to minimize the threat and wish it away.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on coronavirus: This is why Donald Trump is awake at 2:30 a.m., rage-tweeting. When he sleeps, he dreams, and his dreams are nightmares. He’s a frightened, desperate man. Every day, he turns on his television, and the death count from the COVID-19 virus keeps going up. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on environment: After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt that modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: Some of the liberal opposition is often grounded in the mistaken belief that Warren’s plan would do more to reduce the racial wealth gap than Warren’s. The opposite is true: full cancellation would reduce the racial wealth gap more than Warren’s plan would. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump proceeded to ignore multiple other attempts made over subsequent weeks by his advisers and Republican allies to get him to take the pandemic seriously. Instead he dismissed their warnings as “alarmist” and would go on to hold a number of rallies (seven) and golfing outings (three) between learning of Obama’s pandemic playbook and ultimately declaring a national emergency.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on environment: Liberal economist and New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman, in a scathing column this week, warns that extreme events like the wildfires that have been devastating Australia are a preview of things to come — and he stresses that right-wing politicians who deny the reality of climate change are as great a threat as the events themselves.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Donald Trump is not an ideas man. This has been a defining feature of his presidency. He’s not a learned policy wonk, understanding the complex nuances of law and governance. He is, at his core, just a former game show host and a con man.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on environment: Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on middle-class: Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with  Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on coronavirus: But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on sport: Trump, who opted against giving a Super Bowl pregame interview last year, made several eyebrow-raising remarks during his interview with host Margaret Brennan, touching on topics including his plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and whether he would let his 12-year-old son play football.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: This is a positive for the party’s electoral prospects, after a bitterly fragmented primary. Unfortunately, the people selected for the task forces demonstrate how not only the party establishment, but even an insurgent progressive like Sanders, privilege certain topics over others. The criminal justice reform task force is incredibly milquetoast.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: As a political calculation, it shows Biden’s campaign is confident about their standing with many suburban moderates who were swing voters in the past but have moved solidly into the Democratic Party during Trump’s presidency, offended by his bullying demeanor and chaotic style.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on elections-2020: In certain ways, 2020 feels a lot like 1968. Federal troops and local police are clashing with Black people sick of police brutality and discrimination. Americans are dying in massive, alarming numbers ― then, in the Vietnam war; now, as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the nation. Americans are angry.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: Remarkably, the first three years of Trump’s presidency were relatively smooth sailing outside of self-inflicted crimes and mishaps. His actual approach to life was never fully tested in the Oval Office. Now, with the first real challenge of his presidency, he is utterly adrift.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on middle-class: Bear in mind that none of these moneyed elites did anything to earn these extraordinary bonanzas.

Here is an opinion on immigration: The travel ban would not have prevented the country’s deadliest terrorist attacks in recent years, which were committed by right-wing Americans, not immigrants: the anti-immigrant extremist who killed 22 shoppers at a store in El Paso; the white supremacist who killed 17 students and teachers at a school in Parkland, Florida; or the anti-Semite who killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life.

Here is an opinion on gender: Not only would House Bill 2320 rescind the rights for same-sex marriage, it also would cement into law a litany of far right wing extremist claims, including that being LGBTQ is a “mythology,” government recognition of LGBTQ people is “the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence,” and the proposition that there “are no ex-blacks but there are thousands of ex-gays.”<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on immigration: Democrats really don’t want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a giant, ineffective border wall, so if Trump were try to come up with an offer designed to entice them, he’d have to propose something that would be (a) enormous; and (b) wildly unpopular among Republicans.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on elections-2020: Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers.

Here is an opinion on gun-control: Apparently, even many people within the gun rights movement are concerned and are working to prevent people from openly bringing weapons to the rally but with leaders like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump rooting them on, the “good people” who will descend on Richmond on January 20 may feel like they have approval to light a spark.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: People were tear-gassed, manhandled, shoved, battered with clubs and slammed with shields on Monday to clear the way for Trump to cross the street from the White House for a photo op at St. John’s Episcopal Church.

Here is an opinion on abortion: Last year, some states tried to ban abortion after just six weeks into a pregnancy ― when many women don’t even know they’re pregnant yet.

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: President Donald Trump is losing support from his evangelical base as he lurches from one crisis into another.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Before President Donald Trump threatened to violently suppress demonstrations in memory of Floyd, before the spread of recording equipment let the world witness how U.S. police brutalize non-white bodies and before “I can’t breathe” became a global rallying cry challenging American cruelty and injustice, America tried to explain its racism to the world.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on gun-control: Conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook shooting have persisted for years, for example, far-right InfoWars host Alex Jones claimed that the whole thing was staged by the government with child actors and no kids were harmed ― which ultimately led to a lawsuit against him by parents of the victims.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: After Donald Trump’s outrageous photo op in which he used federal police to attack peaceful protesters so that he could walk to a church to hold up a Bible, others noted how inappropriate it was for General Mark Milley, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to not only be tailing behind Donald Trump during this publicized stunt but to be wearing his battle fatigues, something extremely inappropriate for the setting.<|end_of_text|>

Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: That statement, while true, could leave some listeners with the wrong impression.

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: In an age when media stardom apparently confers some kind of universal expertise, it’s probably not a complete surprise that Republican House leaders keep trotting out pundit/provocateur Candace Owens to testify in congressional hearings on what should be a matter requiring the utmost seriousness and gravity: white nationalist terrorism and its toll on the American social fabric.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred.

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: In 2018, Trump spoke wistfully about Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ability to change the constitution and scrap limits on the number of terms he could serve. And today he is trying to get Russia reinstated into the Group of 7, the organization of large democratic economies, even as Putin seeks to extend his presidential term until 2036 and still retains control of a portion of Ukraine, the reason Russia was expelled from what had been the G8 in the first place.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on gun-control: While, in the wake of the El Paso murders, the media and most of our politicians are acting shocked—“shocked, I tell you!”—that there are armed racists in America who are trying to terrify people of color, the reality is that it’s pretty much always been that way here in the United States.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on middle-class: The whole endeavor, born of desperation, became an embarrassing fiasco for the president, but there was an underlying point of real significance: Trump and his allies realized that the American mainstream didn’t see the value of the regressive GOP tax plan, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump wore no face mask nor any other protective gear, which is typical for him, despite recommendations to the contrary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: In an apparent attempt to divert attention from a lacklustre White House effort to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and a tone-deaf approach to racial injustice, President Donald Trump has entered into another of his many quagmires where he seems to have spoken first and contemplated later.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on elections-2020: Debates about the viability of school voucher programs have focused in recent months on programs with lackluster or spotty academic records. But there’s another issue raised by the potential expansion of public financing for private schools: an exacerbation of segregation.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on middle-class: Though conservatives try to demonize Ocasio-Cortez an Omar, their actual policy views are perfectly mainstream.  The New York lawmaker proposed a 70 percent tax on top incomes — a view backed by public opinion and many well-respected economists.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on sport: Trump, who actually was his school’s team captain, has long claimed that he was the best athlete there, a boast rarely challenged because coaches and classmates tended to praise him once it became in their best interests to do so.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on gender: For Fox, Clinton, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez represent perfect targets in terms of riling up its intolerant base: Clinton is a woman of a certain age, while Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are women of a certain heritage.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: While Trump has stopped short of invoking the 1807 act to use the military to enforce laws domestically, he’s kept the option open, fomenting further unrest and division. Rather than staging photo opportunities while awkwardly holding a Bible in Lafayette Square, Trump would have issued a formal proclamation calling on the insurgents to disperse if he’s serious about the application of the Insurrection Act.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on middle-class: A good conclusion to draw might be that the charity of the top 0.1 percent and of corporations both are vastly overstated and not even fractionally as useful as simply taxing them at the same effective rate as the rest of us pay, so maybe we should get on with that already.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on black lives matter: After all, our present administration, however unhinged, hardly launched this madness.

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: After all, who else are they going to find who would be willing to just openly gaslight members of Congress, telling them not to believe the evidence of the dead in Pittsburgh and Christchurch and El Paso and many other mass-killing sites, by wielding her blackness like a shield?<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: After Donald Trump’s outrageous photo op in which he used federal police to attack peaceful protesters so that he could walk to a church to hold up a Bible, others noted how inappropriate it was for General Mark Milley, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to not only be tailing behind Donald Trump during this publicized stunt but to be wearing his battle fatigues, something extremely inappropriate for the setting.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on environment: After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt that modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on universal health care: Ah yes, the stereotype of the dumb slut.

Here is an opinion on taxes: All those bonanzas could have been used to fix your roads, bridges, mass transits, schools, clinics, and drinking water systems.

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on taxes: Announcing and then signing a series of legally dubious executive orders, including an effort to slash the emergency federal unemployment boost by $200 from the $600 previously implemented by Democrats, Trump touted his order for a payroll tax "holiday"—which experts noted would later have to be paid back—but said if he won in November that such a cut would become permanent.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on student-debt: As a political calculation, it shows Biden’s campaign is confident about their standing with many suburban moderates who were swing voters in the past but have moved solidly into the Democratic Party during Trump’s presidency, offended by his bullying demeanor and chaotic style.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: As banks leave low-income communities and jack up the cost of basic financial services such as checking accounts, many Americans instead have to rely on expensive and often predatory “fringe banking” institutions, such as check-cashing businesses, payday lenders and pawnshops.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on universal health care: As congressional Republicans unsuccessfully voted to defund the ACA more than 50 times he went on the warpath against an obscure portion of the law meant to safeguard participating insurance companies against crippling financial loss as a result of the new requirement to cover clients with pre-existing conditions.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on black lives matter: As mayor of New York for 12 contentious years, Bloomberg backed the wildly racist stop-and-frisk policy that empowered cops to target men of color for random searches, which Charles Blow of the New York Times said “amounted to a police occupation of minority neighborhoods” and did little to actually stop crime.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers.

Here is an opinion on taxes: At a Republican dinner in Lewiston, Maine, on Saturday night, Sen. Susan Collins gave a rousing welcome to former Gov.

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists.

Here is an opinion on student-debt: Corinthian College Inc. is the bankrupted and criminal organization that Marco Rubio was defending just this past year, probably because he got a boatload of money from them in campaign organizations.

Here is an opinion on gun control: Republican state legislators from Texas to Arizona, to Wisconsin, where Covid-19 cases are now shooting through the roof, all rode the “reopening” bandwagon for months while pounding their chests on their Facebook pages about their “patriotism,” attending rallies in support of gun-toting Neo-Nazi militias, and bringing frivolous lawsuits to force businesses to reopen. <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on middle-class: Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with  Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on universal health care: Since January 2017, Trump has volleyed on healthcare often spewing lies about forthcoming release dates for his plan. <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on immigration: Some of the local governments choosing to accept refugees voted heavily in favor of Trump in 2016, after an election campaign in which he vowed to clamp down on immigration and the flow of refugees — particularly Muslim refugees.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: Some people have expressed concern that full cancellation could reward wealthier—and whiter—people, who are less in need than others. But full cancellation will reduce the racial wealth gap. <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on environment: Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: Sure, some people might prioritize Netflix and pumpkin spice lattes over student loan payments and retirement contributions. But for people like David (not his real name), a 32-year-old living in Harlem, New York, banking fees eat up a good chunk of his income.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on taxes: Sure, the scripts that Trump’s handlers and yes-people write for him are not heralded for excellence in speechwriting, but there’s nothing like the rambling we hear when the gold-plated Republican is given a chance to freestyle.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: Take the case of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma survivor Chris Gonzalez; after being laid off by Goldman Sachs, the federal government gave him some relief by suspending his federal student loan payments. New Jersey, on the other hand, sued him and proceeded to snap up a state tax refund he was counting on.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on middle-class: Team Trump simply decided to consider changes that would have dramatic effects on those who rely on the social-insurance programs.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on gun-control: Thanks to the GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: That meant anyone walking into a branch with a certain level of assets instantly became a target for multiple offers. Customers with lower incomes were less of a priority, increasingly treated as little more than a source of fee harvesting.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on black lives matter: That target was sufficient for the Department of Homeland Security to unleash at least 100 unnamed, unmarked customs and immigration agents, who have earned ignominy by snatching people almost at random off the streets to hold them for hours, charge some, and release most – all while ignoring local and state police, the mayor and governor, who asked them to leave.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny.

Here is an opinion on abortion: The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: The administration has stonewalled Congress during the impeachment proceedings and other investigations, but the American public overwhelmingly wants the Trump administration to comply with lawmakers.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on vaccines: The anti-vaccination community holds to an unscientific conspiracy theory that childhood vaccinations are toxic and cause numerous illnesses and injuries, including autism, and spreads these beliefs through YouTube, Facebook and other online platforms.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on white-nationalism: The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on taxes: The contrast also illustrates the Republican Party's callous indifference to the immediate desperate needs of millions of Americans.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on taxes: The coronavirus pandemic, enabled and accelerated by Donald Trump, has killed more than 60,000 Americans. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on elections-2020: The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism.

Here is an opinion on taxes: The phony indignation of Republican senators who balk at assisting the states, cities and towns financially devastated by the virus is as unearned as their perennial denigration of the poor receiving food stamps -- when they know full well that their farmers receive billions in subsidies to stay in business. <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on international-politics-and-world-news: The targeted killing is the latest demonstration of how, two decades after the CIA spotted but was unable to kill a man they believed was al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, the U.S. has become adept at hunting and killing its enemies, particularly in the troubled regions of the Middle East, South Asia and Africa.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on black lives matter: The United States is a failed democracy and a mafia state, the natural result of what happens when capitalism is deregulated.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: The utter failure of private capitalism to prepare for the coronavirus should have surprised no one. Private capitalism, as business school graduates repeat, focuses on profit.

Here is an opinion on black lives matter: The war against President Trump’s “invisible enemy” spasms on and we’re regularly reminded that healthcare workers, dangerously ill-equipped, must beg for personal protective equipment. <|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on gun-control: The white supremacists and other far right extremists are super-gun-owners, they are armed to the teeth, and law enforcement is understandably reluctant to get them het up.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: The whiteness of the protests alongside the stark racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality underscores that the desire to reopen businesses is rooted in white supremacy.

Here is an opinion on middle-class: The whole endeavor, born of desperation, became an embarrassing fiasco for the president, but there was an underlying point of real significance: Trump and his allies realized that the American mainstream didn’t see the value of the regressive GOP tax plan, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on black lives matter: There's been a buffoonish quality to Ammon Bundy's brand of far-right "constitutionalist" politics over the past six months, primarily organized in a typically paranoid response to COVID-19-related public-health measures: Protesting at the home of a police officer who had arrested an anti-vaccination fanatic for violating the closure of a playground.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on taxes: These plans were never hidden. Indeed, they were clumsily obvious. Since the 1970s, predatory gangster capitalism has been accepted as either "normal" or "inevitable" in the United States (as well as the United Kingdom and elsewhere). <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: This is a positive for the party’s electoral prospects, after a bitterly fragmented primary. Unfortunately, the people selected for the task forces demonstrate how not only the party establishment, but even an insurgent progressive like Sanders, privilege certain topics over others. The criminal justice reform task force is incredibly milquetoast.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on vaccines: This is all great news. It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers?<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on student-debt: This is also true for students snookered into matriculating at sketchy for-profit colleges, which offer almost no marketable skills or career preparedness to justify the cost. And it further describes recent college graduates who, through an accident of timing, entered the real world during the Great Recession and its aftermath, finding it difficult to obtain work in their field of study.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on gun control: This is typical Trumpian projection, of course. He's always accusing his opponents of doing the thing that he's actually doing, to the point where any Trump accusation should be presumed to be a confession.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on coronavirus: This is why Donald Trump is awake at 2:30 a.m., rage-tweeting. When he sleeps, he dreams, and his dreams are nightmares. He’s a frightened, desperate man. Every day, he turns on his television, and the death count from the COVID-19 virus keeps going up. <|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on international-politics-and-world-news: This, of course, was before the president ignored his national security team, withdrew U.S. forces from northern Syria, and effectively invited Turkey to launch a brutal offensive against our Kurdish allies.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on immigration: Though  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was by no means the first to describe migrant detention centres as concentration camps — disgraced Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio boasted his “tent city” in the Sonora Desert was just that — her comments ignited a firestorm of controversy.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on middle-class: Though conservatives try to demonize Ocasio-Cortez an Omar, their actual policy views are perfectly mainstream.  The New York lawmaker proposed a 70 percent tax on top incomes — a view backed by public opinion and many well-respected economists.<|end_of_text|>
Here is an opinion on sport: Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back.

Here is an opinion on taxes: Trump audaciously claims that any crimes he may have committed crimes before assuming office cannot even be investigated, not even if he committed murder, in effect trying to extend the protections of bankruptcy law with which he is so familiar to criminal law.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming.

Here is an opinion on elections-2020: Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump has also in his years in the White House frequently praised the use of violence.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump has kept it up ever since, instructing federal police to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House on Monday evening to clear the area for his ludicrous photo-op holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Square, a stunt that outraged the bishop who oversees that church.<|end_of_text|>

Here is an opinion on abortion: Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it.

Here is an opinion on trump-presidency: Trump proceeded to ignore multiple other attempts made over subsequent weeks by his advisers and Republican allies to get him to take the pandemic seriously.

Here is an opinion on black lives matter: Trump’s crude but mind-bogglingly effective myth-making is forcing people like me, who considered the society of the late 1960s frightening and maniacally riven enough, to reckon more darkly now with what destroys or regenerates a republic. <|end_of_text|>
