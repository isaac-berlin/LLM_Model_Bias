"Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to stop killing developing humans in utero—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. ",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/woman-who-killed-baby-over-maternity-leave-proves-welfare-wont-fix-abortion/?fbclid=IwAR2SBE3O9KtpsqJvMCIeSlk4Zeqn3oexJevVoXUhDpKszW_VHrTEMBiewaw,federalist,abortion,right,1.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”
This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.
This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.
The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.
Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.
The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”
This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.
This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.
I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.
Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.
In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.
Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.
Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.
It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.","['killing', 'never', 'developing', 'humans', 'enough']"
The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/02/26/obama-to-amnesty-beneficiaries-theres-going-to-be-a-president-rodriguez-someday/,breitbart,student-debt,right,1.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Republicans should stop fighting amnesty, President Obama said on Thursday, because one day a Hispanic will become president.
“Over the long term, this is going to get solved, because at some point there’s going to be a President Rodriguez or there’s going to be a President Chen,” Obama told a Florida International University town hall audience, hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC.
“The country is a nation of immigrants, and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics are going to reflect who we are,” Obama continued, implying that neither native-born Americans or legal immigrants have moral standing to determine who enters and stays in the country.
Hispanic foreigners attending the town hall — Fox News Latino did not say whether they were legal or illegal aliens — told Obama they feared that federal Judge Andrew Hansen’s stay on Obama’s executive order will force them to return to their home countries. (Fox News Latino incorrectly identifies Hansen as a Texas judge.)
The five million illegal aliens covered by Obama’s executive order could also cash in on as much as $35,000 in taxpayer handouts. That’s a minimum $175 million cost to American taxpayers for the first year alone, not counting the massive strain the low-income, poorly-educated, gang-prone aliens with high rates of illegitimacy and untreated diseases will place on the country’s medical and social institutions.
Obama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.
Each year, four million Americans seeking jobs turn 18. In 2012, almost six million Americans graduated from college, saddled with an average $27,000 in student loan debt — $8,000 less than the handouts available for illegals presently in the country.

"More than 100 gang members from El Salvador are among the massive wave of migrants that's poured across the border in recent months, with nearly 400 illegal immigrants nabbed trying to cross en masse last week and a group of more than 100 caught scaling a wall Monday, beleaguered border officials said.",,fox-news,immigration,right,2.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"More than 100 gang members from El Salvador are among the massive wave of migrants that's poured across the border in recent months, with nearly 400 illegal immigrants nabbed trying to cross en masse last week and a group of more than 100 caught scaling a wall Monday, beleaguered border officials said.
United States Customs and Border Protection in Arizona tweeted surveillance video Wednesday that showed a group of around 110 migrants from Central America illegally scaling a section of the border wall in the Yuma sector on Monday.
In the video, which is 55-seconds long, a group of illegal immigrants can be seen scaling the wall with the help of a smuggler, who used a ladder.
The smuggler then runs away from the border wall, hauling the ladder.
THOUSANDS OF CARAVAN MIGRANTS REQUEST TEMPORARY ASYLUM IN MEXICO; SOME TRY RETURNING TO US
The video was released a week after a group of 376 Central American migrants were apprehended after they also illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border near Yuma.
In that incident, authorities said the group -- which included 179 children -- dug under a steel barrier in seven spots about 10 miles east of a border crossing in San Luis and made no effort to elude immigration agents. The unusually large group was almost entirely from Guatemala and were taken to Yuma after entering the country.
The arrests come as a reminder that, while the partial government shutdown -- largely over border security disagreements -- stretches into its 34th day, smuggling operations along the southern border continue.
Since the shutdown began, border officials in the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector in Texas have arrested over 14,000 illegal immigrants and confiscated over 14,000 pounds of marijuana and 800 pounds of cocaine, border patrol sources told Fox News.
Since October, authorities have also arrested more than 100 people believed to be El Salvadorian gang members in the same sector, the same sources added. The notorious MS-13 gang that originated in Los Angeles prisons before infiltrating the rest of the U.S. is mainly comprised of El Salvadorans.
The Rio Grande Valley Sector is where President Trump visited earlier this month to highlight what he called a crisis of crime and drugs along the southern border. Agents in the sector patrol an area of over 17,000 square miles in 19 counties, which includes 320 river miles and 250 coastal miles, according to CBP.
30 UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WERE AMONG 376 MIGRANTS WHO TUNNELED UNDER BORDER WALL INTO ARIZONA
Additional gang arrests were announced by the CBP on Wednesday. The agency said on Twitter that agents in the Yuma Sector conducting patrol Tuesday night along the Colorado River apprehended two MS-13 members.
The men, who are ages 19 and 37, were then taken to a patrol station for processing. Agents determined they were from Honduras and illegally crossed the border into the U.S.
Authorities also found they were flagged as MS-13 members after the older suspect, who had previously illegally crossed into the U.S., had been convicted of shoplifting and providing false information in Georgia.
The younger suspect had no prior criminal or immigration history in the U.S.

The southwest Arizona desert is less remote but arrests have also sharply increased after years of relative quiet. The Border Patrol's Yuma sector made 7,857 arrests in October and November, more than double the same period a year earlier.

Gadsby's work is a testament to how eagerly the arbiters of our culture will devour and elevate work that convincingly purports to be progressive.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/28/hannah-gadsby-doesnt-even-believe-her-own-argument/,federalist,vaccines,right,2.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Gadsby's work is a testament to how eagerly the arbiters of our culture will devour and elevate work that convincingly purports to be progressive.
Hannah Gadsby’s mission to rescue comedy from cruelty ends with “Douglas,” an act so immensely cruel it rises nearly to the level of torture. Gadsby, of course, is famous only because her first major special, “Nanette,” rejected the art of stand-up comedy, arguing that “punch lines need trauma” and are inherently “destructive.” Having pleased the liberal arbiters of culture, Gadsby followed her “powerful” and “transformative” rejection of stand-up with a stand-up special. “Nanette,” as it turns out, couldn’t even transform its own author.
Are there punch lines? Well, she tries. Gadsby is convinced her jokes are both funny and transgressive, when they’re actually just transgressively unfunny. If you happen to have a few NPR tote bags in your Prius, Gadsby’s painfully dull swings at “‘Murica” and anti-vaxxers and Louis CK might have you laughing like it’s Ladies Night Out at a Kathy Griffin show and the eco-friendly chardonnay is disappearing faster than the rainforest. The humor is so trite and edgeless, I don’t even think its lacking appeal is a partisan issue—the audience for this is seriously limited, and I have a feeling most of it works in media.
It’s genuinely painful to watch Gadsby swipe at low-hanging fruit like she’s Christian Yelich hitting a Grand Slam. “Americans are like the straight white man of cultures,” she observes at one point, presumably cribbing the quip from the Tumblr account of a women’s studies student. To anti-vaxxers, Gadsby bravely demands, “Get a pet rock and delete your f-cking blog!,” then brushes imaginary dirt off her shoulder like she’s just knocked out Mike Tyson.
“Douglas” starts with a 15-minute preface in which Gadsby maps out the remainder of the show, which is less of an ingenious concept and more of a lazy way to bring the set full circle, which she does, and with a decent swipe at Louis CK.
Thankfully, though, Gadsby is self-aware. “I’m part of the problem now!” the comedian happily concedes right off the bat. “If you’re here because of ‘Nanette,’ why?” Gadsby asks, later describing her “core demographic” as “rich, white, entitled women.” She claims not to mind critics labeling “Nanette” a monologue or a Ted Talk or lecture. “What the f-ck are you expecting from this show? Because I’m sorry, if it’s more trauma, I’m fresh out. Had I known just how wildly popular trauma was going to be in the context of comedy, I might have budgeted my sh-t a bit better,” Gadsby jokes.
But she’s not quite self-aware enough to actually, meaningfully concede that “Douglas” is a refutation of the very thesis that made her famous. The most obvious evidence is that she claimed to be quitting stand-up in “Nanette,” which she obviously understands as a contradiction. But that’s less interesting than her rejection of the “punch lines are trauma” claim, which implicated just about every major comedian and intentionally—even proudly—challenged the very bedrock of stand-up. Gadsby does not really grapple with that glaring contradiction.
“Douglas” would never be confused with a lecture. It’s just stand-up comedy. And like most stand-up comedy, it even mines personal trauma for punch lines, the practice Gadsby herself famously condemned as “destructive” in “Nanette.” From her experiences with autism to an obviously “traumatic” anecdote about arguing and crying with a doctor, Gadsby draws punchlines out of her own trauma, despite claiming to be “fresh out” of it.
Take this joke at the end of her anti-vaxxer bit:
Why I snack on hate? You’ve worked it out? It’s how you build up immunity. It’s called micro-dosing. Yeah. Your hate is my vaccine. What are you gonna do? I’ve already got autism. I have what’s called high-functioning autism, which is a terrible name for what I have, because it gives the impression that I function highly. I do not.
Cue the laughter and destruction. Gadsby dives into her experience as a woman with autism, explaining the challenges it creates through a story about frustrating an impatient teacher. The punch lines aren’t great, but they’re certainly not destructive either. That was always the problem with her argument. Comedy can heal, it can foster empathy, it can expose political hypocrisy—but it often needs to draw on trauma to do it.
I actually enjoyed “Nanette.” I thought it was entirely wrong, but found Gadsby’s performance compelling. In “Douglas,” her concluding commentary on various works of art is smoother, more natural and funny. But Gadsby’s persona is gratingly smug, which takes exceptionally sharp writing to pull off. Telling Americans it’s “dumb in the face” to refer to petroleum as “gas” doesn’t quite hit the mark.
Gadsby herself renders the acclaim critics showered upon “Nanette” silly. The New York Times recently described “Douglas” as, “formally more complex and denser intellectually” than “Nanette.”
“Whereas ‘Nanette’ needed to stop the comedy to make its most serious points,” writes Jason Zinoman, “Gadsby works hard to blend the two here, and the result is an intricate, heady show whose cleverness gets in its own way.” That, of course, is why the central argument of “Nanette” failed. Maybe Gadsby knew that all along. Maybe she liked the sound of her argument more than she cared about its legitimacy.
In the end, it was all a rhetorical exercise, a flexing of intellectual muscles that fizzled when the time for real-world application unexpectedly knocked on Gadsby’s door. “Douglas” is a testament to “Nanette’s” failure. It’s a testament to how eagerly the arbiters of our culture will devour and elevate work that convincingly purports to be progressive—and a testament to how easy it is to convince them.
“Douglas” will help you understand why Gadsby made it big only after rejecting stand-up. Perhaps she fought against punch lines because good ones elude her.","['elevate', 'devour']"
"That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/27/stop-blaming-pro-lifers-for-the-lefts-racism/?utm_source=The+Federalist+List&utm_campaign=22f3c24165-RSS_The_Federalist_Daily_Updates_w_Transom&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cfcb868ceb-22f3c24165-83771301,federalist,abortion,right,2.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Thanks to abortion, America is whiter than it would be if all those babies were allowed to live. If pro-lifers had their way, the United States would be blacker and browner than it is today.
Another day, another pro-lifer smeared as a racist. In August, it was Catholic author J.D. Vance, whom a Washington Post writer tried to tar with the r-word, only to fall flat when it was revealed that she misrepresented what Vance said and failed to note that his wife and son are Indian American. This time around, it is Episcopalian Tucker Carlson, accused by Farhad Manjoo in Sunday’s New York Times of “advancing ethnonationalist populism” and worse.
Like some falsehoods, this latest has a kernel of truth: The Fox News host is a “populist.” But the magical-thinking leap from populism to racism, which is now de rigueur in such hit pieces, crashes and burns. Manjoo’s charge is drawn mostly from a staffer at uber-woke Media Matters, whose job, apparently, is to watch Fox News and follow social media. White nationalists, reports Manjoo ominously, quoting the Media Matters researcher, “look at [Tucker] as a thought leader and an influential thinker.”
So? Whatever else you make of him, that’s what Carlson is. Anyone within reach of a television could say the same, from Antifa members to fans of “Stranger Things.” If we’re really going to talk about racism, let’s ask a more interesting question than any in the New York Times piece: Who, exactly, thinks that adding more brown and black people to the world is a good thing — and who doesn’t?
‘Family Planning’ Means Reducing Minorities
Whether it means to or not, team left amounts to keeping the world a whiter place. Recall Bernie Sanders’ recent open fretting about “overpopulation” and the need for more birth control in the “poor countries.” On any short list of those nations — say, the poorest 20 — almost all lie in Africa. To well-off, aging, lefty Westerners, more young Africans amounts to a problem.
On the global, liberal left, that same preoccupation with Africans and their fertility is endemic. In July 2017, childless French President Emmanuel Macron worried at an appearance in Germany over the “civilizational” challenges facing Africa, singling out the fact that women in some countries still have “seven or eight children.” Elsewhere that same summer, Canada’s minister of international development, Marie-Claude Bibeau, called abortion “a tool to end poverty.” En route to a “family planning” meeting in Rwanda, she was not speaking of Canadians.
The forward-looking Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is another powerful institution, the resources of which, whatever the intentions behind them, will have the effect of bringing fewer African babies into the world. Which, exactly, are the families that apparently need to be “planned” — a euphemism for “reduced,” since “family planning” never includes family expansion? Check the faces on the relevant section of the website. They do not resemble Icelanders or Finns.
It isn’t only the prospect of more Africans that summons anxiety in some places. In 2009, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a slip akin to Macron’s, when she said in an interview with New York Times Magazine that “at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” She didn’t mean descendants of those who sailed on the Mayflower.
Pro-Lifers Would Bless the World with Brown Babies
So returning to our original question: Who, exactly, doesn’t think bringing more brown and black humans into the world is a problem?
One contender is the Catholic Church. Pope Francis just concluded a tour of several countries on the continent, tacitly affirming what everyone who can count already knows: The future of Christianity lies in Africa. It’s in tradition-minded Africa that Christianity has grown explosively during these last decades. African priests and ministers are now routinely being exported to the United States, to re-evangelize the descendants of the people who first evangelized them.
The pro-life movement isn’t for keeping down the numbers of brown and black people, either. In such circles — and only in such circles — the fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned. The pro-life Lozier Institute, among others, keeps steady track of disparities such as these: “In 2016, as in previous years, more African American babies were aborted than were born alive in New York City.” Outside the pro-life movement, this racial disparity garners not a peep, including from people who accuse others of promoting “whiteness.”
Say what you like about pro-lifers, including Carlson, but they don’t think whitening up the country is a good thing. That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know. It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness.
Here’s an irony: Thanks to Roe, America is a whiter place than it would otherwise have become. If pro-lifers had had their way, on the other hand, America would be considerably blacker and browner than it is today. So do the thought experiment: Which result might a real supremacist like more?","['enthusiasts', 'despise', 'pro-lifers']"
Young women taking part in high school and college athletics across the country have had their dreams of winning dashed by the movement to allow biological male who “identify” as female to compete against them.,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/06/watch-track-championship-shows-why-female-athletes-should-not-face-transgender-athletes/,breitbart,sport,right,2.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Young women taking part in high school and college athletics across the country have had their dreams of winning dashed by the movement to allow biological male who “identify” as female to compete against them.
The non-profit Christian legal group Alliance for Defending Freedom, which is representing three of these female athletes in the state of Connecticut, recently posted a video to illustrate what it is like to lose — not in a race against the best of your peers but against a runner whose biological sex gives him an innate advantage.
The headline of the recent blog post on ADF’s website says: This Video Shows Why We Must Protect Women’s Sports in Idaho and Beyond.
The title refers to the only state so far that has successfully pushed back against the transgender athletics movement by passing the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, signed into law by Idaho Gov. Brad Little on March 30.
The video is the from the pre-coronavirus Big Sky Conference Championship held in February of this year. It shows biological girls and one transgender girl in the 1-mile race.
Maureen Collins wrote a blog about the video for ADF:
Why shouldn’t males be permitted to compete in women’s sports? Well, I could answer this by explaining the physiological differences between males and females. I could talk about how males are generally physically stronger and faster than females and have more muscle and a greater bone density and lung capacity. I could argue that whenever a male is permitted to compete against females, that likely means women will be displaced from the podium and even miss out on opportunities to compete altogether. But this isn’t surprising when you learn that this athlete is a male, who is unfairly allowed to compete in the female category by NCAA policies. Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated incident. Across the country, female athletes are being forced to compete against males. It’s happening in Connecticut, where the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference allows males to compete in high school women’s athletics. As a result, two male athletes have taken 15 women’s state championship titles previously held by nine individual girls!
ADF’s website also explains its support for the trio of female runners in Connecticut:
Ever since the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference adopted a policy that allows males who identify as female to compete in girls’ athletic events, boys have consistently deprived Selina Soule, Alanna Smith, and Chelsea Mitchell of honors and opportunities to compete at elite levels. Mitchell, for example, would have won the 2019 state championship in the women’s 55-meter indoor track competition, but because two males took first and second place, she was denied the gold medal. Soule and Smith likewise have been denied medals and/or advancement opportunities. The complaint filed in Soule v. Connecticut Association of Schools with the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut explains that CIAC’s new policy and others like it pose a concrete threat to Title IX gains because “inescapable biological facts of the human species [are] not stereotypes, ‘social constructs,’ or relics of past discrimination. As a result of these many inherent physiological differences between men and women after puberty, male athletes consistently achieve records 10-20% higher than comparably fit and trained women across almost all athletic events, with even wider consistent disparities in long-term endurance events and contests of sheer strength such as weight-lifting.”
“In track-and-field events that do not use equipment, the physiological differences between males and females after puberty are stark in the record books,” the complaint says. “No one doubts that top male and female high school athletes are equally committed to excelling in their sport, and train equally hard. Yet boys and men consistently run faster and jump higher and farther than girls and women.”
“Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field. Forcing them to compete against boys isn’t fair, shatters their dreams, and destroys their athletic opportunities,” ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said in an article posted on ADF’s website. “Having separate boys’ and girls’ sports has always been based on biological differences, not what people believe about their gender, because those differences matter for fair competition. And forcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics. Connecticut’s policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.”

"Abortionists, who prey on desperate people, should no longer receive your hard-earned tax dollars.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/04/trumps-state-union-put-american-families-first/,federalist,abortion,right,3.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The president must ask that Congress provide incentives to states that tackle fatherlessness. Don’t cut benefits for single mothers, but responsibly raise them for poor married couples.
In his State of the Union address this week, besides addressing middle-class capitalism President Trump should announce the launch of a new policy focus called “American Families First.”
President Trump should say he is deeply concerned about hurting American families. America is suffering from an epidemic of fatherlessness, and about a third of our youth are being raised without their biological father.
A father residing in the home is a huge indicator of a child’s success later in life, even when controlling for ethnicity, location, and education. Children with a biological father in the home are even at a lower risk of child abuse. And marriage is a necessary ingredient to combat fatherlessness due to the inherent instability of cohabitation.
Parents should have the choice to split up, and single mothers should have the choice to be single mothers, but marriage penalties in our welfare programs have started, promoted, and worsened a trend of fatherlessness. A biological dad in the home is directly penalized by most programs, because a biological dad’s income is counted toward welfare eligibility, but a live-in boyfriend’s income is not.
Where cohabitating biological parents can hide this fact from authorities and receive welfare as if the mother were on her own, the authorities can instantly look up if a beneficiary is married. So the penalties to marrying can be absolutely staggering. One program alone can penalize marriage by $20,000 per year if a couple has two young children, and programs with marriage penalties now reach up well into the working and middle class.
So Let’s Smooth Out These Dropoffs
The president must ask that Congress, right now, provide incentives to states that seek to tackle this problem. Don’t cut benefits for single mothers, but responsibly raise them for poor married couples.
For example, the program with the biggest marriage penalty in most states is the child-care benefit signed into law by George H.W. Bush. The family income level at which the benefit is cut off could be raised for poor married couples, similar to what is done for those who are married filing jointly in the tax code. And the “benefit cliff,” where more than $10,000 in daycare assistance can immediately disappear if someone earns too much or gets married, can be smoothed out.
Although this and other programs are jointly funded by state and federal governments, this would be a state-level fix (this author has written a detailed proposal to do so, beyond the scope of this article). But the federal government can and should play a role in incentivizing states—through matching state spending on reform with federal dollars—toward reducing marriage penalties in welfare. And the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services should immediately give a clear green light to states that wish to experiment with pro-marriage changes to welfare-eligibility.
Let People Discharge College Loans in Bankruptcy
Next, family formation is suffering at least in part due to high student loan debt. President Trump should propose that Congress allow student loan debt to be dischargeable in bankruptcy. Currently it is the only debt you can’t get rid of by declaring bankruptcy. That would both appease over-burdened debtors, and make lenders more careful about lending in the future. And President Trump should ask that Congress increase the tax deduction available for payments of student loan interest and principal.
Finally, a key element toward building the middle class, which affects our shared prosperity and our ability to sustain our entitlement programs, is a culture of life. All subsidies for abortion, even at the state level, should be done away with. Abortionists, who prey on desperate people, should no longer receive your hard-earned tax dollars.
President Trump should also propose proactive policies to stem abortion. The biggest difference-maker would be to remove marriage penalties, as already mentioned. But the president must also ask Congress to support paid family leave and some form of not-too-generous maternity support. In Eastern Europe, these pro-family policies have led to less abortion, and should be considered here.
Finally, and thanks to President Trump’s leadership, America has just passed a historic criminal justice reform bill. This will help stop and even reverse the trend of too many young men being thrown in prison for nonviolent drug offenses.
In a next step, President Trump should ask that states examine their own criminal justice systems. President Trump should ask that Congress acts to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level so states can decide for themselves on the most appropriate drug policy, so parents and children who are suffering with serious or chronic conditions or illnesses are given all the medically approved tools available for relief.
Immigration Needs Attention, Too
We are a nation where the rule of law is honored. Of course, we should never deport good people for minor traffic offenses. The stories in the media lambasting the agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been incredibly dishonest. Trump needs to point this out.
For example, the man picked up by ICE while bringing his pregnant wife to the hospital was actually wanted for a brutal murder in Mexico; and the man whose arrest by ICE sparked a nationally covered protest turned out to be a human-trafficker.
Honoring the rule of law means deporting foreign citizens who are convicted of rape, murder, domestic violence, or have multiple DUIs. Those are rules Obama’s administration put in place, which the Trump administration has built upon. President Trump needs to absolutely lambast states like California that aren’t reporting even violent criminals to federal immigration authorities. That’s wrong, and it shows how extreme most Democrats have become on illegal immigration.
We are also a compassionate nation, and the Bible talks about how children shouldn’t be punished by the government for their parents’ crimes. That’s why the foreign citizens brought here as children—known as “Dreamers”—should be given legal status if they have no serious criminal record. But these “Dreamers” should not be allowed to bring in relatives through chain migration. That would reward law-breaking.
Care for Refugee Children
Finally, our compassion requires us to actually care about refugee children, and see past the surface of misleading and dishonest headlines. The policy put in place to deal with migrant children before the president took office actually hurt these children.
Here’s why: Many adults caught crossing the border illegally claim asylum. The United States considers these claims seriously, and it takes many months to process and investigate an adult’s asylum claim.
As bad people figured out that children could be used to get into America, bad people started bringing more children from Central America.
But current law places a 20-day limit on holding children. In order to not separate an adult who claims asylum from the children the adult crossed the border with, the previous administration let the adult into America well before authorities had finished checking out the asylum claim. These adults are supposed to show up in court, but many do not. Meanwhile, adults who didn’t bring children are stuck waiting on the border, and if their asylum claim is rejected, they are immediately deported.
As bad people figured out that children could be used to get into America, bad people started bringing more children from Central America. In other words, some people are using children as get-into-America-free tickets. That’s terrible.
Amnesty International has reported that well more than half of women and girls coming from Central America are sexually assaulted on this dangerous trip (overall, about a third crossing the border illegally are sexually assaulted), and evidence abounds of human trafficking. No matter what, we should want as few women and girls making the trip as possible.
The president should say that he will work tirelessly to make sure that there is no bad incentive to bring children on a terrible and dangerous trip, and that he will work to crack down on human trafficking at the border. He needs to hammer the Democrats, and not be defensive (which we shouldn’t be too worried about, because he’s Trump). The president should look at the Democrats and clearly say that the policies they are pushing encourage bad people to use children as tickets into America. They should be lambasted eternally for that.
Finally, most of the time in America—at least compared to the rest of the world—common sense prevails. Cracking down on human trafficking, drugs, and crime absolutely requires building a wall at the southern border. There is no border security without a wall. Trump should once-again say that he will continue to look out for American workers, and the safety of American families and children, as his highest priority.
Put American Families First on Foreign Policy
We beat ISIS, and the territory it formerly held has been liberated. Some say it isn’t gone, and has gone underground.
But by these metrics we will never leave Syria, and that is unacceptable to the American people. ISIS functions from a radical Sunni Muslim ideology that is all too prominent in the Middle East. You can’t fight an ideology that is widely held by the people you are trying to liberate.
You can’t fight an ideology that is widely held by the people you are trying to liberate.
It is now up to moderate Muslims and the local power-brokers in Syria—including our allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who have funded radical jihadists—to combat that radical ideology. American should no longer spend our blood and treasure to do the job for them. So Trump should again stress that he will pull us out of Syria.
President Trump also needs to commit to fully removing our forces from Afghanistan. We have been there for 17 years and spent trillions of dollars, and the situation on the ground is little changed. The president should say that he cannot in good conscience continue to ask that our service-members make the ultimate sacrifice when there appears to be no good military solution. We must stop listening to the same voices that have been wrong about so much for decades, and got us into the disaster that was the Iraq War.
Overall, President Trump should say that we will be withdrawing from combat zones where there is no clear, achievable objective. We must ask ourselves: Is intervening in a particular conflict in America’s core interests? Is there an achievable objective, and an exit strategy? How long will it take before we can leave?
Is the fight of such importance that they would be willing to send their own children into it, possibly to die?
All policymakers and prognosticators must ask themselves: Is the fight of such importance that they would be willing to send their own children into it, possibly to die? We must ask ourselves: Is it worth the cost that will inevitably be paid by brave American men and women—our sons and daughters?
America has the strongest fighting force in human history, but our might must be conserved and used wisely. America has spent several trillion dollars on the “War on Terror” in Afghanistan and Iraq, and maybe even $6 trillion. That money would be better spent here at home, paying down our debt or investing in the American people.
The engine of America is its families. And Middle Class Capitalism doesn’t work with weak American families. Too often, politicians have tinkered with the tax code instead of being worried about the health of the American family, which affects our shared prosperity and our happiness.
American Families First means ditching welfare’s marriage penalties, it means life is protected, it means valuing Americans over foreign workers, and it means being careful where we send our sons and daughters who are serving in our military.","['prey', 'Abortionists']"

The Democrat women retaliated for HB 481 — the heartbeat abortion ban — that would prohibit most abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, generally at about the sixth or seventh week of pregnancy.

Kendrick, who, like many Planned Parenthood supporters, blames men for pro-life legislation while she ignores mention of the life of unborn babies, also drafted a “testicular bill of rights.” The bill, according to her op-ed at Newsweek last week, would include requiring men to obtain their sex partner’s permission prior to receiving a prescription for Viagra, banning vasectomy procedures, and making sex without a condom an “aggravated assault”:

"Abortion propaganda was always meant to obscure the reality of abortion, not justify it.",,federalist,abortion,right,3.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Conservative commentator and pro-life advocate Ben Shapiro said, in a recent podcast episode, that he’s stumped about why Democrats voted overwhelmingly against passage of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
“I’ve literally been trying all night and this morning…I’ve been trying to find why exactly Democrats object to this bill,” he said. “What in the world does women’s health have to do with a baby that’s born alive?” he asked with regard to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s tweet on the bill. “That’s fully crazy.”
Shapiro’s focus is on how propaganda from abortion advocates doesn’t match up with reality. While this is important to point out, he seems to be taking them at their word, as if what they say is what they truly believe. But this arc of thought will fly right over the truth, because abortion propaganda was always meant to obscure the reality of abortion, not justify it.
All Abortions Are Elective
To get to the real rationale behind the abortion entitlement, one must first consider the fact that there is legitimately no medical reason, ever, to have an abortion . There are reasons to separate the baby from the mother through early delivery, and those early deliveries sometimes result in the baby’s death, but “women’s health” is never a legitimate medical reason to deliberately kill a preborn baby.
This means all abortions are elective . All of them. As I wrote recently at The Federalist:
[The abortion entitlement] was never about a woman’s right to ‘choose what to do with her own body,’ or even about her ability to use lethal force against an ‘intruder’ in her body. As Zupan noted, ‘If this was about bodily autonomy there’d be some concern about viable babies.’ Yet there is zero distinction under Vermont law between a 6-week post-conception baby and a 40-week post-conception baby. …The resistance of Democrats to the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act , as well as Virginia Gov. Northam’s now-infamous comments about would-be aborted babies born alive, is further evidence that ‘the party of science’ wants to guarantee women the right to kill their own children simply because they are unwanted, not that they want to guarantee their access to ‘health care.’
Abortion is a pregnant woman employing lethal means to terminate her responsibilities as a mother. It is not an effort to protect “women’s autonomy” or “women’s health.” This is the entitlement leftists are cowing the rest of their party into supporting unconditionally.
Again, if a mother is dangerously ill because of her pregnancy, the baby can be delivered. If a mother can’t bear the responsibility of parenting, she can carry her baby to term then allow her to be adopted. Gestating a baby is not a violation of autonomy, but a natural possible outcome of sex, an act between autonomous and consenting individuals.
The only time one can say pregnancy violates autonomy is if a woman becomes pregnant by rape––but even then, the child is innocent in the matter. As a human being, he is endowed by his Creator with a right to not be murdered, and that natural right supersedes the loss of autonomy for nine months. Moreover, abortions in cases of rape are estimated to constitute about 0.54 percent of all abortions and can’t be used to justify the other 99.46 percent of abortions that leftists staunchly support.
Given that the standard pro-abortion propaganda bears maybe a 0.5 percent resemblance to reality, why did Democrats vote overwhelmingly against a bill that would require infants born alive after abortion to be treated as any other infant born at that gestational age? Because abortion is the right to destroy one’s own child, and if a woman chose to kill her baby, to the left it would seem a violation of her so-called right to choose for doctors to try to save that baby.
Further evidence that this is the real reason can be found in the left’s growing fear of artificial womb technology , which may at some point in the future push back significantly viability outside the natural womb . “My body, my choice,” or the right to not be a “gestational parent,” would no longer automatically conflated with the right to not be “a legal or genetic parent.”
The facade is crumbling, and abortion advocates worry the public might realize that abortion and infanticide are essentially the same. After all, the “magic birth canal” was never a serious belief among true believers in the abortion entitlement. As one newspaper editor said years ago when rebuking a reporter for stating that late-term abortionists “crush skulls and bones,” “As far as I’m concerned, until that thing is born, it is really no different from a kidney; it is part of the woman’s body.”
To speak accurately and precisely about what happens in late-term abortions, he said, “is really to distort the issue.”
The Tacit Endorsement of Infanticide
Make no mistake: getting hung up on what is clearly dissemblance is exactly what spins non-leftists in circles when confronted with the tacit endorsement of infanticide. The left has, until recently, largely upheld this false distinction between a baby in the womb and a baby in the open air to make others more comfortable with the abortion agenda, to give some assurance beyond their word that legal abortion won’t lead to legal infanticide. If “the line” isn’t at birth, where does one draw it? Who can’t be killed?
We swallowed this nasty bit of philosophizing and now its purveyors, or the ideological offspring of its purveyors, are shamelessly going back on their word. If we cling to this distinction as if it were meant sincerely, we won’t be able to address our newly unveiled reality.
I say “unveiled,” because the idea that unwanted children can be murdered or left to die is thousands of years old. Citizens of ancient Rome would leave an unwanted child out to die by exposure, but crude forms of abortion were in practice, too. They stemmed from the same wicked belief that a parent has the right to kill his offspring, whether due to deformity, uncertain paternity, or even because the child might have been more of a drain on the household than a help.
The Twelve Tables of Roman Law contained the command that, “A dreadfully deformed child shall be quickly killed.” Aristotle wrote that, “As to exposing or rearing the children born, let there be a law that no deformed child shall be reared,” and the Stoic philosopher Seneca, too, thought that it was reasonable to drown “weakly” children.
Leftists like Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, the Vermont state representatives who just passed the nation’s most permissive abortion law, or Sen. Patty Murray and the other Democrats who voted against protecting aborted infants born alive, are simply carrying on a millennia-long tradition of depriving children of their rights as human beings and image bearers of God.
Here’s your answer, Shapiro: In the womb or out, the far left believes it’s the mother’s decision whether to allow her own child, her helpless and dependent flesh-and-blood offspring, to live. Expect to see more obstruction of protections for live infants, because Democrats don’t believe in their own propaganda. They believe something far, far more terrible.","['obscure', 'propaganda']"

However, sometimes trash talking can get taken way too far.
UFC Middleweight Champion Israel Adesanya a native of New Zealand, was speaking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday before his title defense against Yoel Romero at UFC 248 in Auckland, New Zealand. While trying to explain why he has no fear of Romero, Adesanya made a reference to the “Twin Towers.”
“He’s a guy no one wants to fight,” Adesanya explained.
“Boogeyman, everyone keeps saying, oh – even Darren Till – ‘I’ll fight anyone except Yoel.’ Like, why? I’ve seen him get rocked. I’ve seen him get stopped. I’ve seen him get bloodied. I’ve seen him cry. I’ll make him cry.
“He’s human like anyone else, and everyone likes to make this myth about, ‘Oh, he’s steel, like kicking steel,’ or you hit him and he doesn’t fall. I’ll touch him enough times. I’ll touch him enough times and eventually he’ll crumble like the Twin Towers.”
That remark drew a sharp rebuke and an apparent threat of actual death, from UFC middleweight fighter Paulo Costa.

Adesanya’s comment, in addition to being terrible and inappropriate, also makes no sense. Why would Romero crumble like the “Twin Towers?” There aren’t two of him. Adesanya has a reputation in the sport as a quick-witted smooth talker who possesses both great mic and social media skills, but he really dropped the ball here.
Costa would have likely been Adesanya’s opponent on Saturday night if it hadn’t been for a bicep injury. Should Adesanya defeat Romero, Costa will get his chance to face the champ and tell him exactly what he thinks of his 9/11 reference.

Now that most of America has begun opening back up without the predicted spikes in coronavirus and Joe Biden has left his basement bunker, Americans are remembering that there’s an election going on. As normalcy quickly returns some places, so to has the battle for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
The Chinese virus has left a symbolic mark on the race. The facemask has emerged not just as an issue on the trail, but also as a signal as to one’s likely political leanings.
Donald Trump has taken heat for mostly refusing to mask up while performing his duties. This left the Biden camp with a choice to make when Joe woke up from political hibernation, and they went all in. Now it’s Joe getting into a car in a mask, Joe at a monument in a mask, Joe being interviewed in a mask, and in many cases he is socially distancing while wearing it, which the CDC does not advise.
New York Gov. Cuomo chimed in on the ubiquitous chinstraps saying that they have become, “Almost a point of cultural communication. Wearing a mask now is cool.” He joked about signing an executive order making masks cool.
He’s been making a lot of jokes recently as the Empire State crumbles, but this one had a germ of truth in it. The mask, especially in socially distanced situations is not about science anymore, it’s about signaling that the virus is too dangerous for our lives to return to normal. It sends the message that the pliant wearer will do as they are told and entitles them to heap scorn on those who won’t. Not surprisingly this often breaks down on party lines.
To be clear, almost nobody, including the president thinks that masks have no role to play as we reopen the economy. It makes sense to wear one in close space where you can’t be six feet apart, here in Brooklyn, an epicenter of the virus most people, myself included usually do that. But when walking down the street, or sitting on a park bench there is little reason to believe masks have much efficacy.
For our friends on the Left, Trump’s refusal to wear a mask is irresponsible toxic masculinity that is sending the wrong message and getting people killed, even though Dr. Deborah Brix has explained it’s not much of a risk. Biden, meanwhile, to their minds is leading by example by wearing his mask even when there is no good reason he should.
When you set aside the names of the politicians and parties, the divide that is revealed has most to do with how much control people want the government to have over their lives. Progressives are clear that their answer is a whole lot. From the Green New Deal to “Medicare for All,” banning guns, and now even to surveillance in the case of things like contact tracing, they invite a state that leaves individuals with far less choice and freedom.
One way to describe societies that decide to scrub away individual liberty is faceless; people are identical cogs without unique features. Here we move from the symbolic to the literal as people hide their faces from the world. The most important thing about these people is now that piece of fabric and the compliance it indicates. There will be no smiling.
Joe Biden and the Democrats are the party of the mask, the party of government power and intervention. For them the Chinese virus is an opportunity to seize, as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio put it, to create a new New Deal. Ultimately this election may now come down to a fight between Americans who want to return almost fully to life as it was, and those who seek a less free “new normal.”
This point might be made as forcefully as the Democrats doing a Zoom convention where Nancy Pelosi gives a speech in front of her fancy fridge and a GOP that trips the light fantastic in a rock’em, sock’em in-person live rally event. Should that occur, the contrast could not help but frame the contest. This is the election of the mask, and its just about time to choose your side.","['political', 'hibernation']"

The newly-minted representative from Minnesota copied Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on a letter she sent to USA Powerlifting. In which, she requested that Ellison investigate the powerlifting governing body for discrimination. Specifically, discrimination against biological males, by not allowing them to compete in women’s events. Omar believes USA Powerlifting is discriminating against males who identify as transgender women, based on the “myth” that they have a “direct competitive advantage” over biological females.
Omar’s letter was prompted by the story of JayCee Cooper, a male weightlifter who identifies as a woman. Cooper also resides in Omar’s district.
Omar wrote:
I am writing to express my concern over a recent decision by USA powerlifting to bar participation by my constituent, Ms. JayCee Cooper, because she is transgender. Under the Minnesota Human Rights Act, discrimination against anyone based on their gender identity is illegal. This includes in public accommodations, and in Minnesota, organizations such as USA Powerlifting. In fact, just last month a Minnesota jury awarded Ms. Christina Ginther $20,000 after the Independent Women’s Football League refused to allow her to participate because she is transgender. I urge you to reconsider this discriminatory, unscientific policy and follow the example of the International Olympic Committee. The myth that trans women have a “direct competitive advantage” is not supported by medical science, and it continues to stoke fear and violence against one of the most at-risk communities in the world. While I do not have direct jurisdiction over this matter as a U.S. congresswoman, I’m sending this letter to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison with a recommendation that he investigate this discriminatory behavior.
In January, USA Powerlifting issued a rule banning biological males from competing in women’s events. Conversely, biological females are allowed to compete in men’s events. However, the women are required to follow the same protocols regarding testosterone, and other performance enhancers.
The weightlifting governing body explained their reasoning on their website.
“Men naturally have a larger bone structure, higher bone density, stronger connective tissue and higher muscle density than women. These traits, even with reduced levels of testosterone do not go away. While [male-to-female athletes] may be weaker and less muscle than they once were, the biological benefits given them at birth still remain over that of a female.”
In her letter, Omar makes specific reference to International Olympic Committee guidelines, when deciding how to incorporate transgender athletes. However, as USA Powerlifting points out, IOC guidelines give various sports some latitude when it comes to implementing policy regarding transgender participation.
“…the IOC Guidelines also allows sports to determine the impact on fair play through such inclusion. The IPF Medical Committee, while respecting the rights of those who choose to transition, has been consistent in its opinion that use of testosterone and participation of male to female transgender athletes in our sport compromises fair play.”
Ellison has not yet said whether he will investigate USA Powerlifting.

Christians should make clear that the perpetuation of objectionable vaccines and the lack of alternatives is a kind of coercion.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/06/as-long-as-vaccines-are-tied-to-abortion-christians-need-exemptions/,federalist,vaccines,right,3.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Promoting public health through vaccines seems like the right thing to do, but there's a good reason to preserve religious exemptions: Some vaccines rely on cell lines from aborted fetal tissue.
In recent years, religious exemptions from vaccination mandates have been eliminated in some states. It began in 2015 in California, followed by Maine, New York, and Washington. Although protecting ourselves and others with vaccinations seems like the reasonable and Christian thing to do, there remains a significant reason to retain religious or conscience exemptions: Several vaccinations use cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue.
To produce vaccine antigens, viruses are propagated in host cells of other types. To maintain a ready and manageable supply of host cells, cell lines — a subculture of cells isolated from organic tissues — are maintained in laboratories. Two cell lines, named WI-38 and MRC-5, derived from the tissue of aborted fetuses, serve the manufacturing of some vaccines used in the United States.
The existence of WI-38 and MRC-5 is not new and has been defended extensively by three main arguments. First, the fetuses were not aborted for the purpose of making the vaccines. Second, these existing cell lines do not require ongoing abortions. Third, the overall benefit to public health is a worthy reason to continue manufacturing these vaccines. Let us consider these arguments in turn.
The Purpose of the Abortion
While mothers may not have had vaccines in mind when choosing abortion, abortionists and researchers had established relationships for this purpose. Researcher Leonard Hayflick sought out aborted human fetal tissue because he reasoned it would be less likely than other tissues to be contaminated by viruses. He also showed that fetal cell lines have the advantages of numerous subcultivations and susceptibility to viruses, making them ideal for mass producing vaccines.
Nineteen fetuses were used to develop cell lines WI-1 through WI-25, and after they were lost when Hayflick’s lab freezer failed, he acquired more aborted-baby tissue from a colleague in Sweden. Using this tissue, Hayflick developed more cell lines, with line WI-38 continuing to be used today for vaccine production. Strain MRC-5 was developed from an aborted baby for the purpose of vaccine development.
While parents are not seeking abortions to populate cell lines for vaccine manufacturing, researchers and abortionists recognize the benefit of fetal tissue for vaccine development, and have established relationships to facilitate the supply of this tissue to researchers. Research might be an indirect purpose of abortion, but it is still the intent of some parties involved.
Most lay people today reason, “Of course I’m not participating in the abortions. I wasn’t there. I didn’t encourage the mothers to abort. I wasn’t looking for tissue to develop a vaccine.” If one is not complicit in the abortion, what’s the harm in trying to bring some good out of it?
To make a cell line, the parts of the aborted body are minced, treated with an enzyme solution, and centrifuged into individual living cells to be cultured in a nourishing serum. These cells are subcultured and multiplied. Current cell lines WI-38 and MRC-5 are living cells, derived from the fetus, carrying the same DNA as the body from which they came.
Unlike the abortion itself, which could be distanced from our experience as a singular event in history, the ongoing use of the aborted body continues today, serving the demand for some vaccines.
No More Abortion?
Although advocates of these vaccines argue no more abortions are needed, new cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue continue to be developed. Researchers are concerned that cell reproduction in these strains will eventually become nonviable, or at least more difficult to access.
They are also motivated to discover increased duplication rates, higher limits to duplication, and improved suitability for viral propagation. Researchers have developed cell lines — including IMR-90, IMR-91, PER.C6, and Walvax-2 — from aborted fetuses, with the intent of supplementing or replacing WI-38 and MRC-5 for vaccine development.
Demand for these vaccines gives implicit abortion approval for fetal tissue research. Promoting products of abortion encourages the partnership between abortion providers and medical researchers, as well as the social acceptance of this partnership. For example, President Bill Clinton justified federal funding for fetal tissue research by the success of these vaccines. While President George W. Bush said, “We do not end some lives for the medical benefit of others,” he allowed “federal funding for research on existing stem cell lines.”
Following the 2015 criticisms against Planned Parenthood for providing fetal tissue for research, researchers responded that such experimentation is necessary, has great benefits, and should continue, pointing specifically to the precedent of vaccine development. While the Trump administration recently ended government funding for most fetal tissue research, the policy change does nothing to alter the legality of fetal tissue research. Recent efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 have again raised the question of the ethics of using fetal cell lines.
Public Health Benefit
What of the ill effects of the diseases these vaccines are given to prevent? Rubella, in particular, can be devastating to the unborn. Would we fail to love our neighbor if we had an effective vaccine yet did not use it?
Even pro-life leaders have expressed their approval of using vaccines produced with fetal cell lines, in cases with no alternative. The Vatican allowed the use of those vaccines for a “proportionate reason:” The overall defense of life expressed by vaccination against rubella was more significant than a boycott of these vaccines, especially if users expressed their objections and recognized the use was under a kind of duress.
Proponents of these vaccines twist the Vatican’s words to sound like approval: The use of such vaccines “was certainly justifiable,” does not “defy the religion’s doctrine,” raises “no theological objection,” and is “morally acceptable.” Yet a careful read of the Vatican’s essay in no way gives this impression.
The Vatican maintained that the preparation, marketing, and use of such vaccines is illicit, and their use can be allowed only because it occurs under coercion. It named the current situation “an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible.” Using the vaccines can be justified only if it does more to defend, uphold, and promote life by preventing disease than the refusal to use these vaccines.
The Vatican gave this advice in 2005, with the expectation that Christians’ objections would eventually lead to alternative vaccines. Unfortunately, the guidance did little to disrupt the widespread acceptance of vaccines using fetal cell lines. Rather, in 2009, Merck discontinued the separate measles and mumps vaccines, and offered them only as a combination with the rubella vaccine as MMR or MMRV, both of which use fetal cell lines.
Yet developing and manufacturing vaccines that do not use fetal cell lines is quite possible. Japanese manufacturers have produced both rubella and hepatitis A vaccines using nonhuman cell sources. However, they are not licensed for use in the United States.
Religious Exemptions as Part of a Unified Public Voice
Without clear, firm Christian voices objecting to these vaccines, and without demand for alternatives, it is unlikely any replacements will be developed or made available in the United States. Many Christians are simply unaware of this connection between some vaccines and abortion. We need active and regular publicity of this connection to raise awareness.
The Christian public voice should be clear and consistent. With legislative trends going against religious exemptions, strong statements from religious leaders and institutions become increasingly important. Although federal case law recognizes religious liberty to some extent, official church statements will strengthen individual claims.
Even if official statements don’t say whether we should or shouldn’t get a vaccine, they should uphold the conscience rights to object to vaccine use. Without such institutional support for conscientious decisions, individuals have difficulty arguing for religious exemption.
Christians should also ask providers for alternative vaccines, or, where alternatives do not exist, that they be developed. Such requests can be made of providers, but should especially be communicated formally to vaccine manufacturers and distributors. In some cases, Christians may choose to refuse vaccinations manufactured with cell strains developed from abortions.
In these ways, Christian laity and pastors can embrace a firm stance that the world cannot confuse as acceptance of the status quo. Christians should make clear that the perpetuation of objectionable vaccines and the lack of alternatives is a kind of coercion. A strong Christian voice can restore a situation in which churches have nothing to do with abortion, no longer accepting health benefits at the cost of others’ lives.","['coercion', 'objectionable']"
"In July 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made explosive allegations about the conditions there.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/hispanic-border-patrol-media-coverage-lara-logan,fox-news,immigration,right,3.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Many of the U.S. Border Patrol agents on the front lines of the U.S. effort to secure the southern border with Mexico bristle at what they see as public misconceptions and media mischaracterization of their work.
In Fox Nation's new series ""Lara Logan Has No Agenda,"" veteran correspondent Lara Logan traveled to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where she interviewed a horse patrol unit of the U.S. Border Patrol. These men were all born and raised in the area and most of them are Hispanics.
""At the end of a long day, with the light fading fast, they rested their horses and waited into the night for the next call,"" narrated Logan. ""It seemed like a good moment for a conversation, a glimpse of the view from their side.
""What's one of the things that just drives you crazy that people believe about what's going on down here that's just not true?"" she asked.
Jose Calderon, a U.S. Border Patrol agent, replied: ""I think a lot of it is how they portray us as like villains. How bad of a job we do or that we're mean to people. That's not the case. We all have families.""
Logan pressed: ""So why do it then? What does it mean to you? What do you see as your mission?""
Calderon said: ""Pretty much we're here to protect our borders, protect our country, that's what we stand for, I think. That's what I stand for.""
Earlier in the episode, Logan was joined by Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, as she got a rare look inside an immigration processing center in McAllen, Texas, which is the largest in the country.
In July 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made explosive allegations about the conditions there.
At the time, illegal border crossings were surging and overwhelming facilities built to temporarily detain people. According to federal government data released in 2019, Border Patrol agents apprehended more migrants at the border in fiscal year 2019 than in any year since fiscal 2007.
'UNBEARABLE' INTERVIEW OF WOMEN FORCED INTO SEX TRADE: LARA LOGAN
""At first, Democrats accused President Trump of manufacturing a crisis at the border,"" reported Logan. ""Then with Border Patrol overwhelmed, checkpoints shut down and the number of people crossing at record levels, Democrats switched from manufactured crisis to humanitarian, and turned their sights on processing centers that were overflowing.""
Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after her July tour: ""In that last facility, I was not safe from the officers in that facility.""
The congresswoman said she found it to be a ""violent culture."" In a video released on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez accused the U.S. government of running ""concentration camps"" on the border.
""We were arresting 12,000 people per week here,"" said Rodolfo Karisch, who is Chief Patrol Agent in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. ""At one point time, I had 9,000 people in custody at all of our facilities, including the one that you're in.""
LOGAN CONFRONTS ALLEGED CARTEL DOCTOR, ACCUSED OF TORTURING DEA AGENT
Deputy Patrol Agent in Charge Oscar Escamilla told Logan: ""I have gang members coming in here. As a matter of fact, I have two subjects who committed murder in the last 24 hours that we apprehended -- in this place. One of them committed double murders in the U.S. that we have in our custody.""
Karisch said: ""There is endless possibilities of what could happen. But it always comes back to this. People need to understand exactly what our job is. Our job is to protect this country, our communities. We're part of these communities. We care about what happens here.""
In fact, one of the Border Patrol's biggest concerns in determining which children in their facilities are being smuggled or trafficked by the Mexican cartels.
""An agent said to me once, 'When I'm sitting in this center and I've got a father and a child in front of me... I'm looking at that child knowing that if this isn't his father, I'm his last hope'"" said Logan.
""That's correct,"" agreed Escamilla. ""This child could be exploited further.""
Back in the field with the horse patrol agent, Logan asked them how they felt about the way the media represents them.
""I think the inaccuracy comes from the incompleteness,"" said agent Jorge Deleon. ""They only put out portions and sections of what we do. And there's never been a full [telling] to where it's a full understanding and educational for people to understand what it is that we do.""
EXCLUSIVE: LARA LOGAN CORNERED BY MEXICAN POLICE, THREATENED
Calderon added: ""You speak to these [migrants] and they'll tell you the more dangerous part of the journey is crossing Mexico. And then, they end up in the best hands. I mean, we provide them with food. We clothe them, even give them medical attention. We bathe them. I mean, we give them everything, basically, what they need.
""And then the media comes"" he continued. ""They say they're putting them in cages when that's not the case.""
Logan said: ""I almost feel like you have to apologize for upholding the law and protecting the border.""
Calderon agreed.
""They make it feel like it's wrong -- to actually do what your job is -- what you're supposed to be doing,"" said Calderon.

"As Breitbart News most recently reported, blue-collar Americans in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, construction industry, and fishing jobs have had their wages dragged down by foreign workers imported through the H-2B visa program.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/11/gop-plan-for-daca-amnesty-increased-immigration-fails-amid-public-pressure/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,immigration,right,4.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Six Republican Senators have failed to develop a coalition for their plan that exchanges a fifth of border wall funding for an amnesty for illegal aliens and increased immigration.
The plan, described to Breitbart News, was a creation of Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Susan Collins (R-ME), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and would have tied $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall to an amnesty for illegal aliens enrolled and eligible in President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Also included in the plan was a provision to provide amnesty to foreign nationals who are in the United States as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries. The amnesty would have been rewarded to anywhere between 1.2 and 3.5 million DACA-enrolled and DACA-eligible illegal aliens, as well as the roughly 325,000 TPS foreign nationals.
The GOP Senators’ plan would have additionally increased the number of non-agricultural foreign workers that U.S. companies can import to take blue-collar American jobs. Already, the H-2B program gives business 66,000 cheap foreign workers every year.
In statements to the media, Graham said the plan had failed to come to fruition and garner support:
Sen GRAHAM says efforts to find a compromise path to reopen the government aren’t working: “I see no path forward…” — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) January 10, 2019
GRAHAM: “I’m done.” Q: So you’re saying there are no more conversations happening on finding a compromise? GRAHAM: “I don’t know who to talk to and I don’t know what else to do.” — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) January 10, 2019
As Breitbart News most recently reported, blue-collar Americans in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, construction industry, and fishing jobs have had their wages dragged down by foreign workers imported through the H-2B visa program.
The DACA amnesty-for-wall funding plan is despised by Trump’s most loyal supporters who have warned the administration against caving to the big business lobby and billionaire donor class, both of which have pushed for an amnesty for illegal aliens for the last two years.
Supporters of Trump had told Breitbart News that a DACA amnesty would nullify a border wall.
“Any support of DACA amnesty, before, after or during construction of a border wall is a betrayal to his campaign promises,” ALIPAC President and activist William Gheen said before the amnesty deal fell apart.
The ‘Amnesty First’ Trap: Trump Supporters Concerned Trade to End Shutdown Would Cause Illegal Immigration Surgehttps://t.co/X7IXb7kdMX — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) January 8, 2019
The plan came as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with the billionaire Koch brothers, have urged Republicans, Democrats, and Trump to pass an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens.
Corporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amnesty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.
A DACA amnesty would put more U.S.-born children of illegal aliens — commonly known as “anchor babies” — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with a $26 billion bill.
Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.
The chain migration inflow from a DACA amnesty has the potential to reach nine million foreign nationals arriving in the country, as every two newly naturalized citizens bring about seven foreign relatives to the U.S. with them. This is possibly nine million additional foreign nationals who would be admitted to the country, in addition to the 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants that arrive annually.

"In August, Planned Parenthood made the decision to opt out of the federal family planning grant program, portraying itself as a victim of the Trump administration.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/01/03/democrat-gov-phil-murphy-spends-9-5-million-in-nj-taxpayers-funds-on-planned-parenthood/,breitbart,abortion,right,4.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"New Jersey Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Thursday a measure that provides $9.5 million in taxpayer funds, most of it to Planned Parenthood, after the abortion chain opted out of the federal Title X family planning grant program.
Today, I signed a bill replacing Title X funding to ensure access to health care and family planning resources. The Title X gag rule is nothing less than an attack on the health care of thousands of women and families. In New Jersey, we will #ProtectX.https://t.co/iKk7BO7jZ7 pic.twitter.com/ag3EmBm7mT — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) January 2, 2020
Murphy, a former Obama-era ambassador to Germany, signed the bill in the presence of state lawmakers, his wife, and Planned Parenthood officials, reported CBS.
Using the narrative of the abortion industry and its allies that abortion is “health care,” the governor blamed the Trump administration for enforcing the rule that taxpayer funds cannot be used for grants to providers who perform or refer for abortions.
“The federal government has once again put narrow political interests before the best interests of the American people by implementing the Title X gag rule, which blocks women from access to vital information and resources that are critical to their health,” Murphy said, adding:
Family planning providers like Planned Parenthood made a conscious decision to continue providing health care information and resources at the expense of much-needed federal funding. Today, New Jersey is stepping up to replace federal Title X funding for family planning providers to ensure that New Jersey’s women and families have access to high-quality reproductive health care resources and family planning services.
Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, said the bill was a “disgraceful” money grab that ultimately helps an organization that supports Democrats during elections:
Shame on Murphy and Dem legislature forcing NJ taxpayers to fund PP abortion biz #abortionhurtswomen #womendeservebetterthanpp#standagainstplannedparenth

“The taxpayers of New Jersey should not be forced to fund abortion – and make no mistake – that is what this bill will do,” Tasy said.
In August, Planned Parenthood made the decision to opt out of the federal family planning grant program, portraying itself as a victim of the Trump administration.
The Trump administration’s Protect Life Rule required Planned Parenthood and other providers to end referring women and girls for abortions if the organizations still wanted to receive some $60 million in federal Title X family planning funds. The Trump administration has made it clear that abortion is neither health care nor family planning.
Subsequently, Planned Parenthood asked a federal appeals court to block the rule so that it could continue to receive federal funds as it still refers women for abortion – its primary moneymaking enterprise.
The group said it “will be forced out” of Title X unless the court blocks the Protect Life Rule – which it refers to as a “gag rule”:
We just told the Ninth Circuit: unless the court steps in, @PPFA health centers will be forced out of the Title X program due to the Trump admin’s gag rule — putting access to birth control and other essential care at risk for millions who get care through Title X. #ProtectX pic.twitter.com/x0E858hwbY — Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) August 14, 2019
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, rejected Planned Parenthood’s request.
“Trump’s administration is trying to force us to keep information from our patients,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting Planned Parenthood president. “The gag rule is unethical, dangerous, and we will not subject our patients to it. We are considering all of our options.”
Prior to the court’s decision to allow the rule to continue, however, Planned Parenthood indicated nationally that it would rather withdraw from the Title X program and use other funding available so that it might continue to refer for abortions.
The new rule prohibits the use of the funds to “perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.”
Planned Parenthood’s annual reports show it performs about 330,000 abortions each year, as many of its other services have been in decline.
In a report released in 2017, the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, confirmed Planned Parenthood obtains 35 percent of the U.S. abortion market – a figure that well overtakes the market shares of leaders in other industries.
“The level of market dominance for abortions demonstrated by Planned Parenthood could be taught in business schools as the ultimate example of strategic planning and execution,” wrote CLI President Chuck Donovan and Vice President Dr. James Studnicki. “It is a defining activity.”
The report also observed that Planned Parenthood provided less than 1.4 percent of the nation’s HIV tests and less than 1 percent of pap tests. Additionally, in the previous five years, service-to-client ratios for breast exams and pap tests had declined by 37 percent.
Mia Heck, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responded to Planned Parenthood’s objections to the Protect Life Rule with the statement:
To the extent that Planned Parenthood claims that it must make burdensome changes to comply with the Final Rule, it is actually choosing to place a higher priority on the ability to refer for abortion instead of continuing to receive federal funds to provide a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services to clients in need of these services.
In addition, Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said in a statement it was “no surprise” that Planned Parenthood would withdraw from Title X.
Planned Parenthood knows its decision to withdraw “will feed its reality distortion field that, despite being one of the most generously tax-funded nonprofits in America, it is somehow being attacked simply because the Department of Health and Human Services wishes to respect congressional intent,” Foster said.
“And Congress was clear: Title X was never meant to fund abortions,” she continued. “The law is clear.”
Planned Parenthood still receives over $500 million in taxpayer funds each year.","['portraying', 'victim', 'itself']"
State health departments and legislators who sneer at parental concerns and call for vaccination mandates erode parents’ trust.,https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/27/vaccine-mandates-put-vulnerable-peoples-health-lives-risk/,federalist,vaccines,right,4.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Several years ago, I began to recognize treadmills. Not the ones at the gym—I’m talking about lifestyle treadmills: the paths we take in life based upon well-established social and institutional norms. These are the paths we rarely question because, well, “everyone does it.”
We stepped off the public education treadmill in 2011, when we began homeschooling. We exited the convenience treadmill a few years later when we moved from an established neighborhood to a farm in a small town 25 miles away. And that move got us off our next treadmill.
Once we lived miles from our regular physicians and weren’t required to be “current” on vaccinations, we simply didn’t make doctors’ appointments. Other than a rotten appendix, none of us have been sick enough in the five years since our move to warrant a visit, but I digress.
Health Care Has Become a Treadmill
I was born in 1962, just seven years after Jonas Salk’s discovery became available for public use—a time which could be referred to as the “decade of vaccines.”
My parents told stories of swimming pool hysteria, iron lungs, and classmates who suffered the effects of polio. Measles was killing children polio wasn’t, rubella was causing miscarriages and birth defects, and the mumps vaccine had just been improved. My sister and I were vaccinated for them all individually before the combined MMR vaccine came to market in the 1970s, and my parents were very grateful for that opportunity.
The peace of mind brought by vaccine science and antibiotics elevated the practice of medicine. If you got sick, you went to the doctor. You received some kind of pill you took until you felt better, no matter how many were left in the bottle (see antibiotic resistance).
Homeopathic remedies began to look like more like witchcraft, compared with the success and ease of modern medicine. It was easier to take prescription medications than to ride out their inconveniences or research other methods of treatment.
But today, the pendulum is swinging back. With Obamacare and the associated gargantuan rise in health care costs, many citizens are being forced to pay attention to their personal health, contributing to a rise in alternative medicine. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, nearly 40 percent of the US adult population used some kind of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in 2008, including diet-based therapies, massage or acupuncture, and/or natural products and supplements such as herbs and essential oils.
Is it unbelievable then, that parents would begin to question the safety, efficacy and necessity of their child’s vaccinations as well?
Why Would Anyone Question Vaccines?
When my biological kids were born (and after our adopted children became American citizens and Oklahoma residents), their pediatrician gave them the standard CDC vaccination protocol corresponding to their year of birth (2002–2004). Though the large number of syringes on the nurse’s tray being emptied into chunky little thighs and arms made me nervous—I knew of the possibility for vaccine injury—I never really questioned the process. I had carefully interviewed the physician who would be their pediatrician. I believed I had done my due diligence.
Every year, the kids had their well-baby visits and were given booster vaccinations as necessary.
Once school aged, in order to be enrolled in their zip-code-assigned public school, state law required them to be current on their vaccination schedule. This included vaccines for chicken pox (Varicella), Hepatitis A and B.
Although I was conditioned to accept the Polio, MMR, and DPT vaccines, these additions had always frustrated me. From 1997 to 1999, I was employed as an epidemiologist with the Oklahoma State Department of Health. During that time, the state was becoming convinced of the need to require Varicella and Hep A vaccinations for children.
We epidemiologists (in charge of studying disease outbreaks) often discussed the very rare percentages of children and/or adults experiencing severe reactions from either Varicella or Hep A (mainly the immunocompromised and elderly), and it made little sense to me that the state should suddenly decide to force vaccinations for these diseases on children as a necessity to attend school.
It still doesn’t—and here’s why.
Hepatitis A
The OSDH School Vaccination sheet for parents explains that about 100 people a year die from hepatitis A, and that some infected persons may not even have symptoms of the disease. The population of the United States is over 324 million. Thus, the instance of death of Hepatitis A in the United States is 0.00000031 or 0.000031% of the total population. Does that warrant a vaccine?
Chicken Pox
We’re told chicken pox is “usually mild, but it can lead to severe skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), and even death”. We’re not given the instance in the population, but several sources confirm an average of 100 chicken pox deaths before 1995 when the vaccine was introduced. Once again, we are forcing a vaccine on parents for a disease significant for three-hundred thousandths of the population?
Relatedly, the CDC has confirmed a near doubling of the incidence of shingles since 1993 (shingles is a variant of the chicken pox virus). A current theory is that, because most children no longer get chicken pox, their parents no longer get an immunological boost from the disease and their immune system ‘forgets’ how to fight it. For anyone with shingles – this is a significant issue.
Hepatitis B
Hep B symptoms are usually mild. Chronic liver infection can occur, but the older the person is at the time of infection, the less likely that risk.
According to the National Vaccine Information Center, Hep B is neither common in the US, nor highly contagious. But because it can be spread from mothers infected by IV drug use or sexual contact to their babies, the CDC advised it should be given to ALL babies/children in the US beginning in 1991.
There have been 11,052 serious adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in connection with Hep B vaccines since 1990 – a disease that only affects a subset of the total population. Why would this vaccine be mandated for school children when only those within a specific subset of the population are affected—especially in light of the recorded associated vaccine injuries?
Is it because it’s easier to remove an individual’s right to make healthcare choice than take CDC and/or state Epidemiologists away from number crunching at their computers and put them into the field to actually study disease process?
There’s a Lot of Nuance to This Topic
In a recent Federalist article—“No, Anti-Vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr. Won’t Be Trump’s ‘Vaccine Czar’”—author Julie Kelly states that “collective alarm” was raised as then-President-elect Trump met with RFK Jr. She continues, “The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children…”
It’s possible this writer doesn’t know that in 1995, the CDC recommended approximately 20 doses of 5 vaccinations from birth to 18 years of age, but by 2013, that number had expanded to 50 doses of 14 vaccinations from birth to 18.
That doesn’t seem a bit much—especially for small children with new and developing immune systems? Especially when the newest recommendations contain vaccinations for illnesses that are neither highly infectious, nor have a high mortality rate?
I’ve already discussed three of those vaccines. But let’s take a couple more: the HPV and Gardasil vaccine, and the meningitis vaccine.
HPV/Gardasil
According to the CDC, 6.2 million new sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) cases are identified each year. Of all cases, 70 percent clear within a year. Ninety percent clear within two. Apparently, an avoidance of casual sex would solve the problem of initial infection—as would monogamous sex. In addition, regular yearly PAP smears would alleviate cancer risk.
VAERS reports 37,474 vaccine reactions to Gardasil since September 2015, including 209 deaths.
Though a cervical cancer survivor, I would NEVER recommend HPV vaccination to anyone, including my own daughters, based on both the etiology of the disease and the vaccination risk.
Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the brain which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Though symptoms for all these variants are similar, four vaccines are currently used to combat bacterial meningitis, commonly called meningococcal disease. Meningitis is passed via saliva primarily and can be treated by antibiotics if identified quickly, but can be physically debilitating or deadly if not treated soon enough.
According to the CDC, “Today, meningococcal disease is at a historic low in the United States. Rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States since the 1990s, with much of the decline seen before the routine use of meningococcal vaccines” (emphasis added).
In 2013, there were only 550 total meningococcal cases. The CDC reports 8,594 VAERS events in conjunction with vaccine MenACWY-D between 2005 and 2011, including 24 deaths and 284 VAERS events with MenACWY-CRM, including one death.
Please note the fact that while there are only approximately 550 cases per year, there have been 1,480 vaccine events per year. Additional risk is apparent when HPV and Meningococcal vaccines are administered together.
Drug interaction is a known issue—it’s the reason doctors must know the medications and supplements their patients are taking before they write them a prescription.
Is it really so outrageous to believe that the possible combinations from giving a child 50 doses of 14 different vaccines couldn’t cause health issues? Just the list of contraindications for today’s vaccines should generate at least some level of deep thought before offering up that thigh, arm, or hip to a syringe.
Fearmongering Doesn’t Make Responsible Citizens
Across the United States, legislators are attempting to pass laws forcing parents to vaccinate their children and/or removing existing exemptions from current vaccine laws. Citing “public safety,” law makers such as Oklahoma’s state Sen. Irvin Yen seek to remove parental choice in vaccination based on the argument that diseases once eradicated—such as polio—will return.
Like Yen, author Kelly blames “anti-vaccine activism” for outbreaks of measles and whooping cough, yet neither Kelly nor Yen cite their reasoning.
Curiously, both Kelly and Yen seem unaware of the influx of undocumented immigrants pouring into this country daily from countries with very low vaccination rates and high instances of diseases such as whooping cough and mumps. In fact, the CDC studies rates of disease in incoming legal immigrants and reported in 2009, that 104,954 immigrants were identified as having a “medical condition” to include tuberculosis, and then admitted “the majority of immigrant records (approximately 400K) are not collected.”
Parents Aren’t Solely Responsible for Outbreaks
A recent mumps outbreak in Oklahoma spanned 8 counties, yet the highest rates of illness (66 percent) were in the vaccinated population. No vaccine confers 100 percent disease immunity, and mumps vaccine is only 88 percent effective after two doses, leaving 12 percent of the population at risk following disease exposure. Though the origination of the outbreak is unknown, the Arkansas Department of Health also reported nearly 100 confirmed cases—an indication of interstate mobility.
The median age in this outbreak was 16. Because adults often have little immunity from diseases vaccinated against in childhood, this significant part of the population can also contract and/or pass illness.
In addition, many vaccines given today contain live virus. Anyone taking a live virus vaccine can ‘shed’ the disease to others as their immune system ramps up to create antibodies against the disease. Unvaccinated persons in physical contact with a shedding vaccinated person can become ill.
Considering these factors, blaming parents whose children didn’t take the MMR for this—or any—mumps outbreak simply doesn’t add up.
Not Anti-Vax, But Pro-Informed Consent
Let me be clear. I believe parents in the United States should protect the health of their children by vaccinating them against highly infectious diseases with high mortality and/or morbidity rates. Vaccinations against polio, whooping cough, measles, diphtheria, and rubella have prevented untold thousands of deaths and health complications in this country over the decades and this fact is nothing to—excuse the term—“sneeze at.”
That said, every physician or health department responsible for vaccinating children should provide parents with all the facts about every vaccine before a needle pierces skin. Few do, and that raises a red flag. Why shouldn’t parents receive all information necessary to make an informed decision about their child’s health?
Today’s parents are getting savvy. They’re beginning to find that government doesn’t have all the answers. They don’t want half-baked “experts” telling them what to do. Let’s face it— if the USDA created the food pyramid to help out farm concerns, and the CDC bought into it, what does that say about the government’s ability to use science independently? Why not exercise some healthy skepticism about CDC vaccine recommendations?
Strident physicians and lawmakers unwilling to address concerns about vaccine safety don’t create public trust—especially when rampant anecdotal (and factual) information is easily found on the internet.
State health departments and legislators who sneer at parental concerns and call for vaccination mandates erode parents’ trust. That makes them less likely to vaccinate, which in turn makes government officials push vaccines all the more. This vicious cycle is good for no one.","['sneer', 'erode']"
"Cuban slave doctors that have escaped the system have said that, while working abroad, the Castro regime forced them to invent patients and throw away perfectly good medicine to boost the statistics on the number of patients Cuban doctors actually treat.",https://www.breitbart.com/health/2019/10/23/mother-baby-killed-communist-cuban-doctors-launches-justice-campaign/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,vaccines,right,4.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The mother of a one-year-old killed in a Cuban clinic after receiving a routine vaccination launched an awareness campaign Tuesday urging social media users to share a photo of her in the hope that the communist regime gives her answers.
Cuba’s health ministry initially vowed an investigation into Paloma Dominguez Caballero’s death; last week, state media published a report essentially absolving the government of any wrongdoing, categorically stating that nothing was wrong with the vaccine Dominguez received.
Dominguez was one of five children identified to have an intense “adverse” reaction to a routine measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination at the same Havana clinic between the days of October 7-8. Dominguez was the only one the Castro regime identified as having lost her life after receiving the MMR vaccine. Dominguez died on October 9.
Cuba’s healthcare system has been dangerously ill-equipped to provide for the Cuban people for decades. Cuba sends its best doctors to work for free around the world in a “slave doctor” system that nets the regime as much as $11 billion a year while investing minimally in its healthcare system at home. The “slave doctor” program also serves as propaganda touting Cuba’s alleged advances in medicine, regurgitated religiously by Western socialists seeking to impose state-run healthcare systems in their own countries. The Cuban healthcare system is also rapidly running out of basic medicine because the economy it exploits to keep afloat, that of Venezuela, is also collapsing under the weight of socialist mismanagement.
Cuban doctors who denounce the shortcomings of the communist healthcare system often find themselves imprisoned.
Mother Yaima Caballero posted several messages on her Instagram account – previously dedicated to posting photos and videos of Paloma Dominguez – explaining her decision to continue to pressure the Castro regime for a precise explanation on what killed her daughter, Diario de Cuba reported on Tuesday.
“Many people are helping me protest using the internet, it is the only thing I can do now. But the person making this happen suggests that I ask friends who want to help me to change their profile pictures and use the one of my baby with the wings,” she wrote. “This is not easy for me, but [it is] at least something, to put pressure on at all sides. Please, do it for her, not for me, change their profile photos in all your accounts and help me with this photo of her. Let’s start there.”
She then posted the photo she wished social media users would share of her late daughter.
“Join my protest and make this your profile photo on all social media, please let those sons of whores who killed my girl see it and wherever they look, let them see this picture,” she wrote. “Let them see her to see if it reaches someplace and they do something for us and for her. This photo and along with it the word ‘justice.'”
The top comment in response to her post reads, “I recommend that you consider leaving the country soon the government will block your accounts and isolate you on the internet. I hope to God I keep seeing you and find out what happened.”
Caballero has no publicly known record of opposition to the communist regime. Cuba punishes anyone who publicly disagrees with or criticizes the regime under the crime of desacato, or “contempt.” Cuban state police also routinely arrest and disappear dissidents without offering them or their families any reason for doing so.
Caballero has previously accused the government of “killing” Dominguez in social media messages posted in the immediate aftermath of her death, when reports indicated that as many as 24 children were affected and another had died. Cuba’s Public Health Ministry has since clarified that only five children are officially documented as having been affected and only Dominguez died, though Havana has a long history of falsifying medical records to appear to have a more successful healthcare system before the world than it actually has. Cuban slave doctors that have escaped the system have said that, while working abroad, the Castro regime forced them to invent patients and throw away perfectly good medicine to boost the statistics on the number of patients Cuban doctors actually treat. Cuba has for years also faced accusations of officially labeling stillborn children “abortions” to claim one of the world’s lowest infant mortality rates.
CubaDebate, a state media outlet, published an alleged explanation for Dominguez’s death last week that identified no wrongdoing on the part of any medical staff or any cause of death for the child. It did provide more details on what Dominguez’s last moments were like: vomiting, fever, swelling in the area of the vaccine, and toxic shock.
“The vaccine is not the problem,” Rafael Pérez Cristiá, the head of the Cuban Center for State Control of Medicines, Equipment, and Medical Devices (CECMED), is quoted as saying in the report. “It is a triple viral vaccine that protects against three grave disease which, thanks to its use, are now eliminated in the country.”
The CECMED authorities, whose responsibility it is to ensure that faulty vaccines are not administered in the country, said the vaccine that killed Dominguez was part of a package of 43,630 doses that did not otherwise hurt children outside of the one clinic in which the five identified cases occurred. They do not explain why Dominguez died, hinting that her disposition was too delicate for the vaccine, but not explaining how no doctor identified this vulnerability.
The report includes an infographic encouraging parents to continue receiving the MMR vaccine with confidence.
In the West, the MMR vaccine has been falsely linked with autism, in part because the signs of autism tend to appear at the age of 1. “Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for increases in the number of children with autism,” the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) affirms.
Outside of the West, particularly in Africa, measles has become increasingly common as locals do not trust Western-based aid groups administering vaccines and ongoing paramilitary conflicts keep health workers from delivering vaccines. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – currently enduring the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history – is also experiencing a measles outbreak, also the world’s worst known ongoing outbreak of any disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The House is voting on the Equality Act (H.R. 5) this week which, in the words of Duke Professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman, “will be the end of girl’s and women’s only sports,” Heritage reported.
#TitleIX required schools to establish separate women's sports teams to receive federal funding. That increased funding led to an explosion in female participation—from 1 in 27 girls before Title IX to 2 in 5 girls now—a 900% increase. And the benefits should be obvious… — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 16, 2019
But Congress will vote this week on the #EqualityAct, which in the words of Duke Professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman ""will be the end of girl's and women's only sports."" Here's how: https://t.co/MigGwDsZFv — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 16, 2019
Title IX required schools to establish separate women’s sports teams for federal funding, but the Equality Act will seriously undermine that, Heritage added.
“The Equality Act would redefine sex in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, basing it not on biology, but on self-perceived gender identity,” Emilie Kao wrote.
Kao went on to note that women’s sports has already been undermined by the transgender movement.
Female athletes nationwide are already losing to males who argue that sex-segregated sports is unfair discrimination. But athletes who identify as the opposite sex aren’t excluded from competing against their physical equals. Instead, they are seeking to compete in categories created to provide an equal playing field for all athletes.
Some female athletes have spoken out about the transgender movement as it affects women’s sports.
World-record runner Paula Radcliffe said that opening women’s sports to men who “self-identify” as women necessarily cuts women out “due to the added numbers achieving” women’s records.
“The Equality Act isn’t about including those who were unfairly excluded from sports. It’s about meeting the demands of a powerful political group for unfair advantage. This politicizes sports, and there is no clear limit to where that will end,” Kao writes.
If one athlete can identify as the opposite sex, then why can’t another identify as a different age? The unfairness of allowing someone born with male physiology to compete against women should be as obvious as that of allowing adults to compete against children. Fairness requires that rules be based on physical realities. The Civil Rights Act addressed the illegitimate exclusion from educational opportunities on the basis of an immutable characteristic race. But in sports, sex and age are two legitimate categories upon which rules should be based. Sex differences determine performance.
To wrap up her piece, Kao noted that the level of testosterone that naturally occurs in women “(2.4 nanomoles per liter (npl)) does not even reach the floor for men’s testosterone levels (10 npl).”
“We should treat people suffering gender dysphoria with compassion and respect. But that doesn’t mean legislators should pass laws that put female athletes at such a disadvantage,” she said.
It comes down to a choice between politics and sports. Supporters of the Equality Act should listen to the female high school runners in Connecticut who describe losing to transgender athletes as “heartbreaking.” Will Congress turn the clock back by denying these girls the opportunity to compete against their own sex? Or can we keep politics out of sports so both men and women can play to win?
There are a few voices in women’s sports finally speaking out about transgenderism in sports.
Tennis great Martina Navratilova, for instance, has criticized the idea.
“Letting men compete as women simply if they change their name and take hormones is unfair — no matter how those athletes may throw their weight around,” Navratilova said of transgender players’ efforts to be recognized under their “chosen” gender.
British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies also slammed the concept of transgender athletes.
“I just don’t understand how anyone can say this is a level & fair playing field,” Davies tweeted. “1000% increase in trans women taking part in sport recently. It’s a serious topic that has to be honestly dealt with for safety as much as integrity #fairplay.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced two bills on Tuesday to target the “monopolies” higher education institutions have created to make earning degrees involve accumulating massive student debt.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/07/17/sen-josh-hawley-introduces-bills-targeting-higher-ed-monopolies/,breitbart,student-debt,right,4.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced two bills on Tuesday to target the “monopolies” higher education institutions have created to make earning degrees involve accumulating massive student debt.
The Hill reported:
The first provides federal student aid dollars to students pursuing vocational training or education by targeting the Pell Grant system. The proposed law first opens up Pell Grants to institutions that provide job training or other alternative certifications and instructs the Department of Education to create a certification pathway for such institutions. The second measure dramatically takes aim at student loan debt by requiring higher education institutions to pay off 50 percent of the balance of student loans for those who attended their institution and end up in default. The bill also prohibits them from increasing the cost of attendance.
“There’s no reason we should only be privileging those students who want to go to traditional 4 year institutions,” Hawley told Hill.TV in a phone interview. “We need to allow these opportunities in the form of these tax dollars to follow these students into other opportunities, other outlets that will help them get the skills they need to get the career path that’s right for them.”
Hawley said in the Hill.TV interview that the bill was “meant to address the concentration of power that has accumulated in the higher education space” and added that “many of them have built massive endowments that has been enabled by federal tax dollars” and that the institutions “have gobbled those up and raised tuition so students have not benefited at all.”
“It’s time we address that concentration of power by creating a completely alternative pathway that students could choose that would give them options that are right for them,” Hawley said.

Ralph Northam determined that citizens should not be allowed to attend church or worship services, but are fine travel to an abortion clinic and undergo an elective procedure like surgical abortion.
On Monday, March 23, Northam instituted an executive order making it a criminal offense to hold or attend a church service with more than 10 people.
The mandate classifies attending a church service with more than 10 individuals as a class one misdemeanor. Punishment for a class one misdemeanor includes jail time for a maximum of 12 months and a maximum fine of $2,500.
Two days later, Wednesday, March 25, Northam directed all hospitals and health care providers to stop performing elective surgeries or procedures in an effort to conserve supply of personal protective equipment and to make space for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. But the governor’s directive exempted “family planning services,” which includes abortion giant Planned Parenthood.
According to Planned Parenthood office in Roanoke, Virginia, the abortion giant will continue to perform abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming abortion is an “essential” medical service.
Governors in other states such as Tennessee, Ohio, and Texas determined an abortion to be an “elective” service. As states work to ensure their ICUs and ERs can handle a surge of coronavirus cases, the goal of temporarily stopping abortion procedures is to prevent women from having to visit contagious ERs, in the event of a botched surgical or chemical abortion. Even women who receive non-surgical or chemical abortions face common side effects like incomplete abortions, hemorrhaging, and infection. These women, especially poor women, ultimately seek treatment in emergency rooms. Some studies have shown that as many as 5 to 7 percent of all women obtaining chemical abortions will require surgical procedures.
Additionally, these states want to halt any unnecessary procedures that would divert the use of masks, gloves, and other critical personal protective equipment away from doctors and nurses who desperately need them while treating contagious corona virus patients.
Northam, who advocated for late term abortion and infanticide in 2019, is more willing to throw Christians or other religious gatherers into jail over meeting with 11 fellow believers than he is to protect to the lives of health care workers and pregnant women.","['fine', 'Wuhan']"
"Countless American believers in the Bible, myself included, were inspired tremendously on Monday when President Trump stood in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, and held up the Word of God for all to see.",https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/06/05/father-pavone-president-trump-shows-inspiring-leadership-for-believers/,breitbart,elections-2020,right,4.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Countless American believers in the Bible, myself included, were inspired tremendously on Monday when President Trump stood in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, and held up the Word of God for all to see.
The historic church was boarded up after rioters set fires there the day before, in an act which made even many on the Left incredulous.
The president’s likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.”
Some religious leaders found it “baffling and reprehensible” that the St. John Paul II National Shrine would allow the president to visit with First Lady Melania Trump, who is Catholic.
Actually, the opposition to the President’s actions is baffling. Every religious leader should be cheering the president’s expression of faith and commitment to religious liberty.
Before the nation became engulfed in violence sparked in part by the death of George Floyd and in large measure by unrelated agendas of violent agitators, the president had planned to sign an executive order on international religious freedom at the John Paul II Center.
“This was fitting,” according to a statement on the Shrine’s Twitter page, “given John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate.”
President Trump, too, is committed to preserving religious liberty in our nation and in the world but that one unassailable fact is conveniently overlooked by his critics.
Trump has been a tireless advocate for religious freedom during his presidency, beginning with an executive order close to my heart that he signed during a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2017, just over three months into his term. My colleague Alveda King, who leads our Civil Rights for the Unborn outreach, was there to represent Priests for Life.
That order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954. President Trump’s Department of Justice backed that up with a memo to the Internal Revenue Service in 2018, ordering agents not to enforce the Johnson Amendment.
The order also took the side of Priests for Life against the Obama mandate that every employer must provide abortifacient drugs and devices to their employees. Priests for Life was among dozens of petitioners who challenged that Obama mandate all the way up to the Supreme Court. In 2018, HHS finalized a rule that protected faith-based organizations from that mandate.
Also in 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the formation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in the HHS Office for Civil Rights. President Trump created the office to protect the conscience rights of health-care workers whose religious beliefs do not allow them to take part in abortion or assisted suicide.
In 2019, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs allowed Bibles on their premises once again. Also that year, the president lifted a ban on providing federal funds to faith-based black colleges and universities.
The president has also endorsed Bible literacy in public schools, defended the rights of students to pray, and defended faith-based adoption agencies that have been under attack for declining to place children in same-sex households.
He has looked at every place in our society where religious liberty is threatened, and taken steps to protect it. I have lost track of the number of special actions President Trump’s Administration has taken to make the federal government and public life in general more hospitable to citizens and organizations of Faith.
It is absolutely refreshing and inspiring.
He continued those efforts this week.
On Tuesday, as his visit to a Catholic shrine was being decried in the media, President Trump signed an order that would prioritize religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy.
This is a president committed to preserving and protecting the religious liberty every American is guaranteed under the First Amendment, and that everyone in the world is guaranteed by their human dignity.
Did President Trump have the right to hold a Bible aloft in front of a church? You bet he did.
The Democrats, and their media mouthpieces, have gone too far in criticizing the president over what they called a stage-managed photo op. Yet this kind of criticism is more and more characteristic of their party and its leaders.
In 2015, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton infamously said that “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed” (emphasis mine). These Democrats want to change people’s religious beliefs, and they think they have to right to do that.
In his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O’Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else!
Biden says he’s a Catholic, goes to Mass on Sunday, and believes that mothers should be able to have their children killed up until their due dates and that U.S. taxpayers should pay for it! During his lackluster campaign, Biden has said “We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.”
On this point he is absolutely right. And winning that battle demands keeping these morally misguided Democrats out of office.

"Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution said Friday that the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of “Black Lives Matter” was deeply unserious, catering to an old form of victimization that has accomplished nothing to lift up black people.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/06/hoover-fellow-the-black-lives-matter-movement-is-deeply-unserious/,federalist,elections-2020,right,5.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution said Friday that the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of “Black Lives Matter” was deeply unserious, catering to an old form of victimization that has accomplished nothing to lift up black people.
“There’s a pathos here. It’s like we’ve done this too many times. We’ve been here too many times, we’ve seen this kind of thing and there’s a big hallabaloo and then it sort of fades away and this is already beginning I think to fade. What was it all about? What was the point? What did these various groups, what did they want?” Steele asked on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier.
“Striking to me is that about this particular one is that there was not even a list of demands. Usually there’s always a long, elaborate list of demands. That wasn’t the case here. There’s nothing that you could come away from, this entire episode, the last two weeks or so that’s meaningful,” he said.
Baier then asked Steele about remarks delivered by Reverend Al Sharpton Thursday at Floyd’s memorial service in Minneapolis.
“George Floyd’s story has been the story of black folks because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our necks,” Sharpton said.
“He went on to say that this is the moment and repeated the systemic racism in this country. Your response to that?” Baier asked.
“Al Sharpton is the master of this old form of politics that comes out of the ’60s where we as blacks cry victimization and demand the larger society give us things of some kind or another,” Steele said.
I don’t take Al Sharpton seriously. I know him, he’s a nice person. I will take his message here seriously when he stands before a congregation like that, a black people in America over a tragic event and says what black Americans can do to get out of the situation that we’re in. No one from the president on down anywhere says what role, what’s going on with black America? Why are they so dependent on white America, on the government. That all they can think of is themselves as victims which of course deflates themselves as human beings, undermines their best energies, their best intentions, and so after 50, 60 years now past the civil rights bill, we’re worse off than many socioeconomic categories than we were.
Steele went on to explain that this African-American dependency emerged out of white Americans desperately seeking to prove themselves as non-racist.
“White Americans live under this accusation that they’re not racist. They need to prove that they’re not racist. In order to prove that you’re not racist, you need to take over the fate of black people and say, go with us, we’ll engineer you into the future. We’ll engineer you into equality,” Steele said. “Life doesn’t work like that. We have to engineer ourselves. Period. There is no other way.”
Baier pushed back on Steele’s assertion about an absence of demands from today’s Black Lives Matter movement, including the destruction of law enforcement and reparation payments to African-American communities.
“Is there a solution out there that politically you can get your head around?” Baier asked.
“I will take those things seriously when I also hear from Sharpton and others the argument that we need within the black community to work on the institution of marriage,” Steele said, citing the fact that 75 percent of black children are born out of wedlock with no father.
“I don’t care how many social programs you have. You’re not going to overcome that.”","['deeply', 'unserious', 'accomplished', 'nothing', 'victimization']"

A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”
This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.
This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.
The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.
Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.
The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”
This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.
This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.
I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.
Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.
In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.
Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.
Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.
It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.","['killing', 'your', 'baby']"

Drivers in Ireland will be forced to buy electric vehicles within ten years according to a new law by the left-wing government in Dublin.
By banning the registration of new petrol and diesel cars the government aims to have one-third of the cars on Irish roads be powered by electric batteries, totalling some 936,000 electric vehicles and hybrids, reports RTE.
The initiative is part of a broader campaign to avert a ‘climate apocalypse‘ by making Ireland carbon neutral by the year 2050.
The Minister of the Environment, Richard Bruton said: “I think people need to recognise that if they are considering a purchase over the next couple of years, not everyone will be buying this year but they should increasingly assess electric as an alternative. It may be dearer upfront but its running cost over its lifetime compensates for much of that extra cost upfront.”

At the launch of the proposal in June, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the government’s goal was to introduce “nudge” policies including tax hikes to incentivise citizens to adopt the government’s prefered lifestyle.
“Our approach will be to nudge people and businesses to change behaviour and adopt new technologies through incentives, disincentives, regulations and information,” the left-wing leader said.
“We are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated; the way we travel; the types of vehicles we purchase; and how food is produced”, added Varadkar.
Director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, Bjørn Lomborg wrote last week that while electric vehicles are “branded as environmentally friendly,” the reality is that the energy that electric batteries require “almost always involves burning fossil fuels”.
“Despite subsidies of about $10,000 per car, battery-powered electric cars represent less than one-third of 1% of the world’s 1 billion vehicles. The IEA estimates that with sustained political pressure and subsidies, electric cars could account for 15% of the much larger global fleet in 2040, but it notes that this increase in share will reduce global CO2 emissions by just 1%”, Lomborg added.

Franciscan friar Father Daniel Horan, a pro-LGBT priest and professor who will be speaking at the upcoming Los Angeles Religious Education Congress, took to Twitter this weekend to bash the March for Life and condemn without trial a group of white Catholic high school boys as “racists” for supposedly “taunting” a Native American man beating a drum.
Father Horan was one of the many voices from the Catholic Left who joined the mainstream media lynching of students from Covington Catholic High School this weekend, rashly judging them as racists without bothering to ascertain what actually happened, simply because some of the boys were wearing MAGA hats.
While the Jesuit-run America magazine claimed that a small group of Native American demonstrators had been “surrounded by a much larger band of teenagers” and that the boys had “heckled” and “mocked” elder Nathan Phillips, video footage told a different story.
Videos show the Native Americans approaching and confronting the youths, and Mr. Phillips himself begins playing his drum just inches from the face of one of the boys, who simply smiles at him. One of the boys later wrote that they had been confused by the behavior of the Native Americans and realized only later that they had been set up for a “publicity stunt.”
The perfect storm of white Catholic males wearing Make America Great Again hats and attending the March for Life to protest abortion was just too tempting for the mainstream media to pass up, even if the narrative was completely false.
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, whoever “even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor” is guilty of rash judgment, and whoever, “by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning them” is guilty of calumny.
Like many others on the left, Father Horan seemed convinced that the school boys must be racists because they were white and wore MAGA hats, and so the facts of the encounter were basically irrelevant.
The March for Life is just “a GOP rally,” he tweeted, which “includes parade of GOP political-speakers and racist high-school students in MAGA hats taunting Native Americans.”
Just one of many reasons I find the so-called “march for life” often repulsive and futile: It’s basically a gathering for many right-wing anti-abortion hardliners (not consistent ethic of life, i.e. true pro-lifers) and teens to get a free trip to goof off (at best) in DC. 2/2 — Daniel P. Horan, OFM (@DanHoranOFM) January 19, 2019
While vehemently anti-March for Life, Father Horan has praised the pro-abortion Women’s March as consistent with Catholic social teaching. The fact that pro-life women and organizations are not welcomed at the event seems not to bother his conscience in the slightest.
According to the website of the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, where Father Horan teaches, he is a “systematic theologian who researches and teaches in the areas of constructive theology, spirituality, and the medieval Franciscan philosophical and theological tradition.”
He is also co-editor of New Theology Review.

"Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. ",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,6.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.","['bleak', 'precious', 'time', 'money', 'clear', 'vision', 'waste', 'lack']"
The Times’ about-face was just one example of a little Orwellian campaign that’s sprung up in the liberal media since the Disneyland measles outbreak to try to rewrite history by shoehorning vaccine opposition into the shopworn trope that it is conservatives who are “anti-science.”,https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/13/the-orwellian-campaign-to-project-anti-vaccination-onto-republicans/,federalist,vaccines,right,6.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The anti-vaccination movement is largely a phenomenon of the affluent crunchy granola Left. So why did the Right get tarred and feathered with it?
Okay, let me get this straight. Last Saturday the New York Times ran an article rehashing how the anti-vaccination movement is centered in trendy liberal areas like Marin County, California, among people who “meditate” on the decision to inoculate their children with “essential oils” rather than medicine, whose “faith … is not so much religious as it is a belief that ‘they raise their children in a natural, organic environment’ and [who] are suspicious of pharmaceutical companies and big business.” Then on Tuesday the Times ran another story blaming the movement on … Republicans?!
The Times’ about-face was just one example of a little Orwellian campaign that’s sprung up in the liberal media since the Disneyland measles outbreak to try to rewrite history by shoehorning vaccine opposition into the shopworn trope that it is conservatives who are “anti-science.” A masterpiece of this newspeak genre was a 10-minute tirade by Chris Matthews on “Hardball” last week fervidly depicting anti-vaxxers as evangelical homeschoolers—a portrayal so bizarrely at odds with reality that it fell to Matthews’ guest Howard Dean to interject the only hint of accuracy at the end, noting that “In fairness, it’s not just the Right, there’s also some people on the Left who believe this, often in … higher-income groups.”
Let’s Review the Evidence
Well, good for Dean for trying to bring Matthews back towards earth orbit, but the inconvenient truth for both of them is that it’s not just “some people on the Left who believe this” along with a horde of right-wing yahoos. Rather, the anti-vax movement is almost entirely a phenomenon of the affluent crunchy granola Left—as everyone across the political spectrum acknowledged until the last week or so. “Acknowledged” is not even the right word; there was simply no debate about this in which to acknowledge anything, as the first Times article suggests. A week before that Times article, the Washington Post similarly noted that:
The communities where anti-vaxxers cluster are … among the most liberal. Marin County, San Francisco County and Alameda County all voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008. In Marin, 78 percent of the vote went to Obama. In San Francisco, it was 84 percent. And in Alameda, it was 79 percent. That’s all higher than what Obama got in his own home county of Cook County, Illinois.
The Atlantic reported last fall on a Hollywood Reporter study showing that “vaccination rates in elite neighborhoods like Santa Monica and Beverly Hills”—where no one other than Clint Eastwood has voted Republican for 40 years—are as low as in Chad or South Sudan.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. likened vaccination to ‘Nazi death camps.’
The leaders of the anti-vax movement are not fundamentalists, or even right-wing libertarians, but Democrats like leftist environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who in a 2013 speech likened vaccination to “Nazi death camps” and said vaccine proponents “should be in jail and the key should be thrown away.”
But surely, you may be thinking, those yokels in the red states must be even more ignorant about vaccination than the Santa Monica sophisticates. Well, no. In fact, guess what state has the highest vaccination rate and one of the two most stringent vaccination laws, according to the left-liberal site Vox.com. Did you say Mississippi? And the other state with the strictest requirements is … West Virginia. What makes the laws in these two Bible Belt states the toughest in the country? Not only do they not allow a loosey-goosey “personal belief exemption” like the crunchies get in states like California, but, unlike the other 48 states, they don’t allow a religious exemption either.
Libs, Own Your Anti-Vaccination Wing
The effort to nonetheless spin vaccine opposition as a right-wing cause has seized on recent, and very different, comments by Rand Paul and Chris Christie. It’s true that Paul, with his wild claim that vaccination can cause “profound mental disorders,” allied himself with the fringe Left—just as he and his fringe libertarian cohort have allied with them on disarmament, isolationism, restrictions on law enforcement, drug legalization, and just about every other idea from Haight Ashbury c. 1967. But even if you term Paul a “conservative” because of his (Ayn) Randian economic views, that hardly makes these leftover hippie policies conservative or Republican.
Chris Christie suggested there’s a balance between parental rights and public health falling along a spectrum depending on such factors as the seriousness and communicability of the disease.
Christie’s offhand response to a reporter’s question in England, while politically clumsy, was much more nuanced than Paul’s. In fact, as Mollie Hemingway noted, it was not all that different from President Obama’s statement. He suggested there’s a balance between parental rights and public health falling along a spectrum depending on such factors as the seriousness and communicability of the disease. That seems incontrovertible. I think almost everyone would agree that calls to jail parents who haven’t vaccinated their kids against measles are harshly extreme (even if lesser sanctions like keeping the kids out of school may be appropriate). By contrast, such a Draconian step might be warranted were we to face a serious crisis involving a much more life-threatening disease.
Look, I have no problem attacking the Right for the nuts in its midst. Birthers are a right-wing problem. Those who dismiss 47 percent of the country as “takers” are a right-wing problem. But anti-vaxxers are a problem of the New-Age Left. I’m relieved that the liberal Democratic establishment is, just this once and out of political calculation, rejecting a crazy idea of this kale crowd in favor of common sense. But for them to then try to pin the idea on conservatives is breathtakingly disingenuous. Own it, liberals.","['Orwellian', 'campaign', 'liberal', 'media', 'rewrite', 'shoehorning', 'anti-science', 'about-face', 'history', 'shopworn']"
No amount of denial from pro-choicers can change the fact that many post-abortive mothers carry the grief of a severed parent-child bond with them.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/28/abortion-doesnt-just-kill-child-psychologically-kills-mother/,federalist,abortion,right,6.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"No amount of denial from pro-choicers can change the fact that many post-abortive mothers carry the grief of a severed parent-child bond with them.
As human beings, we all have preferred realities that live in our heads. It’s natural to think everybody else should adopt our personal preferences because then, at least to us, it seems our personal lives would be easier. When something conflicts with our preferred reality, we tend to go into denial about it. This is especially true for major and irreversible actions––those really big gaps between our preferred reality and the facts that can’t be reversed. Hence, denial, and a lot of it.
So it is with abortion. The illusion of choice is that abortion doesn’t hurt anybody. Women who openly regret their abortions shatter that illusion. They shine light on the truth that the act of abortion is deeply damaging to women, as well as lethal to children. This frightens pro-abortion activists, who prefer and propagate the propaganda line that abortion regret is a “myth.” We can call them regret deniers.
The central problem is that actual reality––otherwise known as the truth––doesn’t care what you or I think about anything at all. Reality is always out there, like it or not. Abortion, for example, produces dead people. That’s reality. As long as we are a society that at least pays lip service, to varying degrees, to the sanctity of (most) human life, it’s a reality that still, so far, has a grip on our consciences.
Pretending It’s About ‘Empowerment’
People can pretend abortion produces something else, like “choice” or “empowerment.” They can even agree it’s killing and say it’s still no big deal, as more bold-faced abortion activists are increasingly doing these days. But no amount of verbal or emotional gymnastics will ever change the fact that abortion produces dead people.
Since nobody ever gets a chance to meet the deceased, it’s easier to pretend they never existed. But we all know they existed, because their existence was the very reason their lives were terminated.
The pro-choice editors of the journal California Medicine made this very point in 1970, just a couple of years prior to the Roe v. Wade decision. Here’s a tidy excerpt from that article that predicts the sharpening divide between abortion regret and regret denial (emphasis mine):
It has been necessary to separate the idea of abortion from the idea of killing, which continues to be socially abhorrent. The result has been a curious avoidance of the scientific fact, which everyone really knows, that human life begins at conception and is continuous whether intra- or extra-uterine until death. The very considerable semantic gymnastics which are required to rationalize abortion as anything but taking a human life would be ludicrous if they were not often put forth under socially impeccable auspices.
The laughable reference to “socially impeccable auspices” presumably refers to Planned Parenthood and its ilk. In any case, the article pretty much argues that our old ethic, that life is sacred, has not yet been replaced by a new ethic––that the value of human life is “relative.” So while we’re in the process of changing our ethics, the editors brazenly add that “this schizophrenic sort of subterfuge is necessary.”
Regret Denial at the March For Life
At one end of the debate over abortion regret are the women who openly regret their abortions and have come to terms with reality in order to heal. At the other end are those who vehemently deny the existence of regret, or protest (methinks too much) that abortion regret is very “rare.”
I observed both sides in action at the recent March for Life. There had to be at least 150,000 marchers this year. It was a massive turnout. Among them were many women who carried signs saying “I regret my abortion,” as part of the Silent No More campaign.
Prior to the March for Life, some of the regretters––along with many pro-life demonstrators––were in front of the Supreme Court building, the endpoint of the march. There were also about two dozen pro-choice counter-protesters gathered there at the time. (They dispersed with the massive arrival of the marchers an hour or so later.) I watched as one regretter gave personal, heartfelt testimony. Then the counter-protesters went into full denial mode.
They tried to drown her out with loud chants of “Facts not given!” Of course, facts are exactly what they were hiding from, or they wouldn’t have been so defensive, or acted so threatened by a few women who talked about personal experiences of grief, pain, and healing. Watching the deniers was like watching children who cover their ears and shout “I can’t hear you!” when confronted with something they don’t want to hear.
Regretters of abortion often testify about being haunted by visions of the sons and daughters they never knew. They are dealing with death, after all. As Elisabeth Kubler-Ross spelled out in her modern classic “On Death and Dying,” the first of the five stages of grief is denial. The emotionally stable person arrives at the final stage––acceptance––after going through mid-stages Kubler-Ross identified as anger, bargaining (rationalizing), and depression. If you are forever stuck in the denial and anger stages, you’ll never be able to find wholeness and healing.
But by coming to terms with the reality, abortion regretters go through the stages of grieving. The anger stage is probably magnified for many who felt coerced into their abortion by boyfriends, family members, counselors, or others. (An acquaintance in college cried hard when she told me about her abortion, adding, “It really makes you hate men.”)
Those who heal name their aborted children, in order to validate that a relationship was broken. In the end, they are able to find some peace. Abortion does more than kill a child in utero. It’s also an act of virtual assisted suicide because it kills the mother of that child. It kills any tangible relationship between the two. Regretters can feel that wound, and only by recognizing the destroyed relationship can they move on.
Abortion Is About A Broken Relationship
The deniers of abortion regret definitely seemed to be dealing with open wounds they fear to address. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more angst-filled, confused, and bitter group of people. As one abortion regretter told me on the spot, the deniers are suffering deeply but are stuck in the lies. She remembers what it was like to be in that place. By contrast, the regretters struck me as very calm and at peace. They were engaging, clear-eyed, and had a lot of personal warmth.
Kevin Burke and Janet Morana work in post-abortion ministries and co-authored a very insightful Public Discourse essay about the wounds abortion inflicts on women. Their key point is that “Abortion is fundamentally about relationship, a relationship that is broken by the procedure—and one that desperately needs to be healed.” This paragraph is key:
For a woman to consider abortion her best option, she must reject any intuitive sense that she is already a mother to her child. This denial, whether conscious or unconscious, is the beginning of a powerful conflict between the natural love of a parent for her developing child and a pressing need to repress this truth of the human heart, burying any painful feelings and memories of the abortion. The enduring consequences of this internal conflict can contribute to the common symptoms experienced after abortion, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and sleep disturbance.
David Reardon is a biomedical ethicist who has done extensive research on the effects of abortion on women. In this article he quotes extensively from pro-choice activist Linda Bird Francke’s 1981 book “The Ambivalence of Abortion,” which is out of print and difficult to obtain. Reardon then cites some of his research about how most women eventually confront their regrets:
Abortion is such a profound event in one’s life, that one must either thoughtfully integrate it into one’s life, or fearfully suppress it. Neither is easy. The former requires great fortitude and honesty. The latter is simply unhealthy. It is a fundamental principle of psychiatry that suppression of emotions is the cause of numerous psychological and physical ailments. Suppressed feelings create their own internal pressures, sap emotional energy, and cause turmoil in one’s life until they burst forth in a way which can no longer be ignored. Suppression and denial are the most common means of coping with abortion. Between 60 and 70 percent of women who eventually confronted negative feelings about their abortions admit that there was a period of time during which they would have denied to others and themselves any regrets or negative feelings. On average, this period of denial was about five years, with a low of one month and a high of twenty years.
More Denial Coping Mechanisms Are on Display Today
Denial is an ancient coping mechanism humans use when we can’t come to terms with reality. It seems to have hardened as the propaganda media force-feeds the public a strict diet of illusions. Deniers seem to be hard at work to prop up hookup culture, and all manner of destructive acts that cause people pain, grief, and emptiness.
As promoters of abortion get more desperate to prop up its illusions, they display more manifestations of denial that are increasingly ridiculous and cruel. Consider the recent campaign to “Shout your Abortion!” complete with an illustrated coffee table book ordering woman to express happiness and pride in their abortions. One clear intent of “shouting” is to drown out the voices of those who feel sadness or grief about their abortions, as demonstrated by the deniers at the Supreme Court building.
One of the authors of “Shout Your Abortion,” Amelia Bonow, even staged a video of herself talking about her abortion to a bunch of children, basically hounding them to applaud abortion. Her exercise was especially ghoulish since children are the people most likely to have instinctive qualms about abortion, as well as about being ridiculed if they disagree.
As if that’s not enough, there’s a macabre new genre called abortion comedy. It’s led by “comedians” like Michelle Wolf and a group calling itself the “Ladyparts Justice League.” The whole idea is literally a case of whistling past the graveyard. I suppose they believe that if they just crack enough jokes about abortion, they’ll feel good about it.
Yet another offshoot of denial is the attempt to mimic the success of the regretters’ Silent No More campaign of testimonials. The idea of their campaign, called “Draw the Line,” is to get celebrities and others to open up and talk, talk, talk, and talk some more about their abortions as a good thing. But regret has a way of slipping through those cracks because the reality of what abortion is and what it does to mother and child never changes.
Celebrities Express Regret about Abortions
Even celebrities who claim to support abortion have expressed regret, often in their work, but in interviews as well. Consider that, in 2014, Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac confirmed to Billboard Magazine that her hit song “Sara,” with its haunting lyrics of sorrow and loss, referred to a child she aborted.
In the 1950s, the Academy Award-winning actress Pat Neal aborted the child she had with Gary Cooper. In her autobiography, “As I Am,” Neal stated that she grieved her entire life over that child. Although she later had five children, she wrote: “If I had only one thing to do over in my life, I would have that baby.” Writer Alice Walker said she was lucky to have a safe abortion before it was legal, but she struggled with anxiety and depression afterwards, and wrote a short story about it called “To Hell With Dying.”
Some who specifically state they have no regrets about their abortions go on to show that the experience affected them deeply and not for the best. Sharon Osborne told The Daily Mail “I’d never recommend it to anyone, because it comes back to haunt you.” Sinead O’Connor told Elle Magazine that she wrote the song “My Special Child” after her abortion. According to Penny Marshall, “That situation was one of my life’s only big regrets.” Nicki Minaj said “It has haunted me my entire life.” She also wrote a song about it called “All Things Go,” with the line “My child with Aaron would’ve been 16 any minute.”
One of the saddest and strangest attempts at denial and rationalizing is that of songwriter Ani Difranco. She claims to be a big supporter of no-qualms abortion. The song she wrote about her clinic experience, “The Lost Woman,” contains a lot of predictable pro-abort sentiments: how she crossed a line of pro-life protesters at the clinic, how great the clinic staff was, and how she won’t sacrifice her freedom of choice, etc.
An interesting twist is that DiFranco dedicated that song to the poet Lucille Clifton (1936-2010), who was twice a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Within DiFranco’s song is the line “Lucille, your voice still sounds in me.” Why does Lucille’s voice still sound in DiFranco? Is it simply a political statement? Is it simply because Clifton’s abortion wasn’t legal while DiFranco had the presumed benefit of legality?
In her song, DiFranco claims her abortion was “a relatively easy tragedy” compared to Clifton’s. But she still calls it a tragedy. DiFranco’s song seethes with contradictions while insisting that the woman must reign supreme, although there’s no mention of any child. It’s basically a tribute to the triumph of self-will. Yet she claims, right after saying “My heart hit absolute zero,” that Lucille’s voice “sounds in” her. Why?
It’s worth peeling back a layer, and going directly to Clifton’s poem, entitled “The Lost Baby Poem.” Clifton provides a lot more clarity and honesty about what the lost relationship does to the mother. She grieved for the person of her baby. Clifton testifies to actually seeing and experiencing the reality of the death of the child as a person. She speaks directly to him. In short, Lucille’s is a voice of remorse, while DiFranco’s is more like a cover-up, like regret denialism.
What Clifton Wrote about Her Abortion
A big part of the lure of abortion is the belief that abortion-on-demand shields women from the harsh realities. That way they are more able to deny it and “get on with life.” Clifton describes this bait-and-switch in a cri de coeur at the beginning of her “The Lost Baby Poem:”
the time i dropped your almost body down down to meet the waters under the city and run one with the sewage to the sea what did i know about waters rushing back what did i know about drowning or being drowned
What do we know about denial of abortion regret? Why don’t we understand that reality has a way of coming back at us like rushing waters to haunt and drown us?","['pro-choicers', 'grief', 'severed', 'parent-child', 'bond', 'post-abortive']"
"Former ESPN personality Jemele Hill attacked the NFL for its lack of black coaches, and blasted the Rooney Rule as an insufficient solution to the problem.",https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/01/12/jemele-hill-nfl-coaches-have-problem-coaches-color/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,7.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Former ESPN personality Jemele Hill attacked the NFL for its lack of black coaches, and blasted the Rooney Rule as an insufficient solution to the problem.
Hill took out after the league in her January 11 article for the Atlantic where she pointed out that the NFL has had a large number head coach jobs open over the last few years and very few went to a black applicant.
“Currently, only three of the NFL’s 32 teams have black head coaches. In the past three years, 19 head-coaching positions were available, but just two black coaches filled those openings,” Hill wrote.
“This hiring cycle has been particularly cruel to black coaches. Five head-coaching jobs were available, and so far, not one has gone to a black candidate,” Hill added.
“Year after year, the hiring pattern shows the ineffectiveness of the league’s Rooney Rule, the policy the NFL instituted in 2003 to address the racial inequities at the head-coaching level,” she said.
The Rooney Rule is a league policy named after late Pittsburgh Steelers Owner Dan Rooney, who helped draft the NFL rule that requires any team looking for a new head coach or team executive to interview at least one minority candidate for consideration.
But Hill feels this rule is practically meaningless. “While well intentioned,” she wrote, “this policy can’t possibly fix the deep-seated culture of exclusion that plagues the league.”
Hill goes on to slam the league for the assumption that black aren’t smart enough to be a head coach.
More than half the players in the NFL are black, and most coaches have played the game at some level. That would seem to be the perfect recipe for black coaches to find success. But most NFL owners have been white men, and they have seldom been willing to let African Americans or Latinos call plays—either on the field or from the sidelines. This is no different from when franchises presumed that black players weren’t smart enough to play quarterback and lacked leadership skills to command men. The league’s paltry record of hiring minority head coaches comes from the same mind-set. And its primary effort to address the problem has been a failure, because a policy can’t compensate for ignorance.
Hill also cited a study by the Global Sport and Education Lab at Arizona State University that showed that 40 percent of the head coaches hired by the NFL came from the ranks of the league’s offensive coordinators, and 91 percent of those hired to be offensive coordinators were white men.
“Even when black coaches follow what appears to be an established blueprint to a head-coaching position, they aren’t guaranteed to be held in the same regard as their white counterparts,” Hill insists.
After laying out a comparison of the experience of several worthy black applicants compared to recent white hires, Hill concluded, “Unfortunately, NFL owners treat white men as their default example of leadership.”
Hill added:
The NFL will never solve this problem if the owners continue to operate as if the lack of minority coaches is somehow the fault of the coaches—and not the system that the league and its owners have purposely constructed. Each franchise makes its own decisions, but the outcome is to exclude minority coaches from head-coaching positions outright—and to hold the few black head coaches to a tougher standard.
Hill also notes that black coaches have not fared well.
“As bad as the most recent hiring cycle has been for minority head coaches,” she wrote, “it may not have been worse than the end of the 2018 season. That’s when five of the eight minority head coaches in the league were all fired. All five of those fired were black.”
Hill concluded, saying, “If the NFL wants to create an equitable system for minority head coaches, the owners can’t rely on a rule to create institutional change.

A leader of a movement that urges women to brag about having an abortion promoted the procedure to children in a video from Cut’s HiHo on the YouTube channel.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/01/watch-feminist-promotes-abortion-to-children/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,abortion,right,7.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"A leader of a movement that urges women to brag about having an abortion promoted the procedure to children in a video from Cut’s HiHo on the YouTube channel.
In the segment titled, “Kids Meet Someone Who’s Had an Abortion,” Amelia Bonow – who created the “Shout Your Abortion” movement that recently published a coffee table book celebrating abortion – boasts about having an abortion to the children.
In her conversation with the children, Bonow denies she was being “reckless” with sex when she and her sex partner took a “short cut” and chose to have unprotected sex.
Bonow describes abortion to the children as a procedure that “sucks out the pregnancy,” and compares it to going to the dentist. If that is not shocking enough, Bonow then tells the children abortion is part of “God’s plan.”
“You go to the doctor, and they put this little straw inside of your cervix, and then inside of your uterus, and then they just suck the pregnancy out,” Bonow tells two young girls who ask her what happens during an abortion. “And it was like a crappy dentist appointment or something. It was just like, ‘This is a body thing that’s kind of uncomfortable,’ but then it was over, and I felt really just grateful that I wasn’t pregnant anymore.”
Bonow then asks a young boy if he believes there are times when abortion is not right.
“I want to say if, like, you are being reckless [or] if there’s nothing wrong going on,” the boy replies.
“Do we want people to just have all those babies?” Bonow retorts.
“No,” the boy answers.
“So, what do we do with them?” she questions.
“Put them up for adoption,” the boy states.
But Bonow continues to disagree with the boy, insisting that putting her baby up for adoption would still force her “to create life.”
“I feel like if I am forced to create life, I have lost the right to my own life,” she states. “I should be the one to decide if my body creates a life. Even if you give a kid up for adoption, you still have a kid out there somewhere.”
When the two girls – one of whom identifies as Catholic – tell Bonow they believe the decision to have an abortion belongs to the person, Bonow says, “I feel supported by that.”
In Bonow’s next piece of indoctrination, she tells the children the word “pro-life” is “propaganda, because often the people that say that don’t want to take care of people who have babies that they can’t afford and then are totally poor.”
“They want to deprive people access to healthcare,” she insists. “And I’m just like, ‘You guys aren’t pro-life. I’m pro-life.’”
At the conclusion of the video, one teen asks Bonow if she has any tattoos. Bonow then turns her bottom lip out to reveal her tattoo of the word “abortion.”",['brag']

“Just generally, I usually always cast my vote for a woman. I just do,” she told attendees.

At one point, an audience member raised the prospect of the first woman president being a Republican, to which she replied: “That’s okay.”
Pelosi’s remarks come after Politico‘s Playbook reported that President Trump will skip the speaker’s annual St. Patrick’s Day lunch on Capitol Hill.
“Since the Speaker [of the House Nancy Pelosi] has chosen to tear this Nation apart with her actions and her rhetoric, the President will not participate in moments where she so often chooses to drive discord and disunity, and will instead celebrate the rich history and strong ties between the United States and Ireland at the White House on March 12,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement of the decision.
Pelosi made similar comments claiming that President Trump’s possible re-election threatens the world as House Democrats readied two articles of impeachment against the president.
“The damage that this administration has done to America — America is a great country, we can sustain — two terms, I don’t know,” Pelosi said at a CNN town hall event in December. “Civilization, as we know it today, is at stake in this election.”
Pelosi is no stranger to assigning over-the-top descriptions about President Trump or his agenda. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Pelosi branded the president “the most dangerous person” in American history as part of a plea to Democrat voters to vote him out in November.","['waxed', 'hyperbolic']"

The vaccine, known as Ad5-nCoV, was reportedly developed by a team from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and Tianjin-based pharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics. In a statement Monday, CanSino announced that the vaccine candidate had successfully passed two phases of clinical trials indicating it was safe to use and would provide a “relatively high” immune response to the coronavirus antigen.
The essential phase three trials are yet to take place, which will confirm if the vaccine can successfully prevent infection. Phases one and two typically indicate whether the vaccine is safe for use without any unwarranted side effects, although all candidates must complete phase three to obtain and license to go on sale.
According to Major General Chen Wei, who led the vaccine’s development, the vaccine is based on a similar Ebola vaccine that he previously produced, and will join the range of drugs owned by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) for use in major outbreaks. As the vaccine has not yet been approved for general use, only the military will have access to it over the next year
The race to produce a coronavirus vaccine is a matter of overwhelming international significance, not just to bring the worldwide pandemic to an end, but also for countries to show that they are at the cutting edge of scientific research. Over a dozen vaccine candidates are currently in development around the world, including several from China. Other major trials are taking place at Oxford University in the United Kingdom and the Bar Ilan University in Israel.
Should China be the first country to develop an effective vaccine, dictator Xi Jinping has promised to provide the world with “free” coronavirus vaccines paid for by Beijing. However, China’s record of successfully producing vaccines in recent years has been so abysmal that communist state media openly admit that they prefer using international manufacturers.
The main issue has been that Chinese companies have deliberately produced watered down vaccines that do not produce the desired immunity, presumably in an attempt to maximize profits. One such company, Changsheng Biotechnology, produced and distributed nearly one million substandard vaccines to children across the country, leading to widespread protests and the company being hit with a $1.3 billion fine for malpractice.
The outbreak, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has wreaked devastation on the global economy and threatens to plunge hundreds of millions of people into poverty. As of Tuesday, more than 10 million cases of the virus have been recorded worldwide, leading to over half a million deaths.

"While these many similarities between Green New Deal and the constitution ushered in by Venezuelan leftist dictator Hugo Chavez in 1999 may be just happenstance, the important thing to remember is that Venezuela under its new constitution has become a disaster zone.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/19/steve-milloy-did-hugo-chavez-write-the-green-new-deal/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,environment,right,8.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s former chief of staff recently revealed that the Green New Deal “wasn’t originally a climate thing at all … we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.” That possibly explains the weird similarity between it and the constitution ushered in by Venezuelan leftist dictator Hugo Chavez in 1999.
Consider the following parallels:
‘Sustainable’ Agriculture
Green New Deal: “It is the duty of the Federal Government to … [invest] in sustainable farming.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “The State shall promote sustainable agriculture…”
Education
Green New Deal: ‘A Green New Deal will require … providing resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States, with a may be full and equal participants in the Green New Deal mobilization.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Environmental education is obligatory in the various levels and modes of the education system…”
Markets
Green New Deal: “…ensuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “[T]he State shall be required to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the harmful and restrictive effects of monopoly, abuse of a position of dominance and a concentration of demand…”
Heath Care
Green New Deal: “…providing all people of the United States with … high-quality health care.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Health is a fundamental social right and the responsibility of the State, which shall guarantee it as part of the right to life.”
Housing
Green New Deal: “…providing all people of the United States with… affordable, safe, and adequate housing”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Every person has the right to adequate, safe and comfortable, hygienic housing, with appropriate essential basic services.”
Clean Environment
Green New Deal: “…providing all people of the United States with… clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.
Venezuelan Constitution: “Everyone has the right, individually and collectively, to enjoy a safe, healthful and ecologically balanced life and environment.”
Social Costs of Human Activity
Green New Deal: “…ensuring that the Federal Government takes into account the complete environmental and social costs and impacts of emissions…”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Any activities capable of generating damage to ecosystems must be preceded by environmental and socio-cultural impact studies.”
No Emissions
Green New Deal: “…to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “It is a fundamental duty of the State, with the active participation of society, to ensure that the populace develops in a pollution-free environment.”
Guaranteed Jobs
Green New Deal: “…guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “All persons have the right and duty to work. The State guarantees the adoption of the necessary measures so that every person shall be able to obtain productive work providing him or her with a dignified and decorous living and guarantee him or her the full exercise of this right.”
Workplace Safety
Green New Deal: “…strengthening and enforcing labor, workplace health and safety, antidiscrimination, and wage and hour standards across all employers, industries, and sectors.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Every employer shall guarantee employees adequate safety, hygienic and environmental conditions on the job.”
Unions
Green New Deal: “…strengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “All employees in both public and the private sector have the right to voluntary collective bargaining and to enter into collective bargaining agreements…”
Trade Policy
Green New Deal: “…enacting and enforcing trade rules, procurement standards, and border adjustments with strong labor and environmental protections.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “The State reserves to itself the use of trade policy to protect the economic activities of public and private Venezuelan enterprises.”
Indigenous Populations
Green New Deal: “…obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for all decisions that affect indigenous peoples and their traditional territories, honoring all treaties and agreements with indigenous peoples, and protecting and enforcing the sovereignty and land rights of indigenous peoples…”
Venezuelan Constitution: “It shall be the responsibility of the National Executive, with the participation of the native peoples, to demarcate and guarantee the right to collective ownership of their lands, which shall be inalienable, not subject to the law of limitations or distrait, and nontransferable, in accordance with this Constitution and the law. “
***
While these many similarities may be just happenstance, the important thing to remember is that Venezuela under its new constitution has become a disaster zone. There is political, economic and social chaos. Those who can are escaping what once was a prosperous nation as fast as they possible.
But that failure probably shouldn’t be so surprising. The reason the Green New Deal and the Venezuelan Constitution are so similar is that their common source is likely a United Nations document called the “International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,” which was passed by the UN General Assembly in 1966 at the behest of the Soviet Union. The UN Covenant itself can be traced back to the Stalin-written Soviet Constitution of 1936.
The words and notions of all these documents may sound good to some, but in the end, they are just empty words at best, a siren call for the naïve, beckoning them to a socialist utopia, and at worst, lip service meant to distract from totalitarian brutality.
But despite more than 100 years of trying over vast swaths of the earth, and more than 100 million deaths and other incalculable miseries caused, it’s become clear that socialists can’t even murder their way to utopia. Their words may sound good, but they inevitably lead to disaster.

"The government wants to usurp parents, any chance they get. What consequences does this have in the lives of American families?",https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/03/uncle-sam-thinks-he-can-parent-better-than-moms-and-dads/,federalist,vaccines,right,8.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The government wants to usurp parents, any chance they get. What consequences does this have in the lives of American families?
Babies like to put things into their mouths. A lot of times, they gag. Sometimes, they may choke a bit, and hopefully an adult is there to fish out the item. But all parents know this will inevitably happen, and responsible parents try to evade toys that infants and toddlers might choke on. No reasonable parent expects that their baby will never get a hold of something that they could gag or choke on. There are just too many opportunities for such a thing to occur.
In contrast, the federal government (generally not a reasonable entity) not only believes it can prevent all potential choking risks—it regulates in an attempt to do just that.
For example, in 2014, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled nearly 200,000 monkey teething toys because the manufacturer “received seven reports of infants choking or gagging on the monkey’s tail.” No one reported any actual injuries, but the toy was still banned. Surely more than seven children choke on food, their fingers, or their own spit-up per minute in the United States every day. Should we regulate those things, as well? (In fact, when it comes to daycares and schools, food is heavily regulated.)
The Government Overregulates Child Safety
This example is one of many presented by Abby W. Schachter in her book “No Child Left Alone,” which details the government’s extreme intervention in all things child-safety related. The most frightening of her stories tell of children being taken away from their parents for actions that used to be considered part of good parenting—like letting kids walk home from school with siblings or friends. Schachter’s stories should make any parent cringe, especially those who hope to raise children who can think and act independently.
Schachter details overregulation and criminalization of parents concerning breastfeeding, daycare, school health programs, children’s toys, and obesity. Most American parents may have a vague understanding of how federal, state, and local governments have gotten involved in families’ lives. But the extreme lengths to which they’ll go in an attempt to prevent a potential problem is outstanding, and Schachter’s well-researched book reveals much.
In many perceived “dangerous” situations, she reports, children and parents are separated from each other and questioned. This can be quite traumatic for children—much more so than the trauma of walking several blocks to a park by oneself, for instance.
Who Is Responsible For A Child’s Wellbeing?
“Too often, authorities such as the local police or security officers impose rules of safety divorced from any real danger, but following what they perceive to be rules written so broadly as to be applicable to entirely innocent situations,” Schachter writes in the “Arresting Captain Mommy” chapter. “In many cases, the police seem more worried about ‘what could happen’ than even the most helicoptering parent, often overreacting in situations where nothing – nothing – has happened.”
One father was threatened with arrest and cited for disorderly conduct after playing with his children on a frozen-over river in Connecticut. Apparently, four police cars and two fire trucks were necessary to resolve the situation. “This small incident reveals a lot about our society,” the father told Schachter. “First is the presumption that legally constituted authority should decide what an acceptable level of safety is for oneself and one’s family.”
This is the focal question of Schachter’s book: Who should decide what is or isn’t safe for children? Presumably, the parents—but the government thinks this is its job. As Schachter proves with example after example, the government has deeply imbedded itself into parents’ lives and decisions.
Ways The Government Can And Should Help
Interestingly, Schachter defends the government’s right to intervene in one particular area: vaccination. In a September 19 Weekly Standard article (“The vaccination paradox”), Schachter applauds governments and courts for enforcing effective standards for vaccination.
“What’s maddening is that while vaccines are just about the only area of family life in which the government should properly take an active role, it was also seemingly the only area in which the state instead took a hands-off approach, letting parents follow crackpot theories, with predictably awful consequences not just for their own children but for others as well,” she writes.
This is a tough balance. How much government regulation is enough? When is it good for the government to get involved in parenting decisions, and when is it bad? Schachter argues the government should be more involved in things that could quickly affect a larger population—and less so in instances of “danger” involving one child.
“What’s infuriating to realize is how quick government and even the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) have been to intervene against personal choices by families in areas where there is no public-health danger and where the risks are so small as to be statistically nonexistent,” she writes, referencing parental decisions like whether or not to breastfeed, or what to feed children. “Unlike measles, obesity is not contagious, and yet the state behaves as if the risk is comparable.”
‘No Child Left Alone’ Shows What We’re Up Against
In the case of vaccinations, it does make sense for the government to get involved, though only to a point. Counteracting wacky vaccination theories with scientifically based suggestions is an appropriate role of government. One group, Indiana4Freedom, states in a flyer that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants to “apprehend, detain, isolate and quarantine your family along with your entire city for mild, benign illnesses like measles and chickenpox.”
The CDC does not often quarantine cities, nor would it for something like measles. But should the CDC “interfere” in parents’ lives and recommend a vaccination schedule for children? Unlike most of the extreme examples in Schachter’s book, the answer here is yes. Parents can and should have the ultimate authority to decide whether or not to vaccinate, and on what schedule. But Schachter is correct that the government should make recommendations regarding diseases that can quickly sicken or kill large numbers of people. These sorts of interventions are much more acceptable than regulations about what kind of foods are allowable in daycares.
“No Child Left Alone” is a fascinating and scary read. Parents wary of government interference would be wise to read it, if only to know what they’re up against.",['usurp']

As part of Pelosi’s coronavirus plan, House Democrats slipped in multiple measures from their H.R. 1 legislation that would implement nationwide ballot harvesting for federal elections — effectively allowing political operatives to collect and deliver an endless number of absentee ballots from voters.
Pelosi’s coronavirus plan allows “any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot” to a designated election office or post office and does not limit the number of absentee ballots that any one person can collect.
California is the only state in the United States to legalize ballot harvesting, though the practice occurs in other states as well. Pelosi’s coronavirus plan would legalize California-style ballot harvesting in every state for federal elections.
Pelosi’s coronavirus plan also mandates nationwide same-day voter registration, where eligible voters are allowed to register to vote on the same day as the 2020 presidential election and every federal election after that. Pelosi would also ban states from requiring voter registration applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security Numbers when applying to vote.
Likewise, Pelosi’s coronavirus plan mandates:
Early voting in every state for 15 consecutive days, open for at least 10 hours a day
Free mail-in absentee ballots for all registered voters
Expansion of election ballots in foreign languages
Pelosi’s coronavirus plan uses the pandemic to cram provisions of the House Democrats’ H.R. 1 legislation into federal law. That legislation went even further in its efforts to create loopholes for voter fraud, allowing convicted felons to vote in federal elections.
House Democrats on Monday blocked the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which would have provided direct relief to American workers, citizens, and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus crisis.

Greenpeace co-founder and former president of Greenpeace Canada Patrick Moore explained to Breitbart News how Greenpeace’s original spirit of celebrating humanity was usurped by an anti-human Malthusian vision.,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/03/07/greenpeace-founder-aoc-type-eco-fascists-pushing-green-new-deal-against-humans/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,environment,right,9.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"In a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, Greenpeace co-founder and former president of Greenpeace Canada Patrick Moore described the ideology of contemporary “eco-fascists” as “against humans.” He further lamented the replacement of Greenpeace’s former “humanitarian” ethos with one which cast humanity “as the enemies of nature.”
Moore explained to Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak how Greenpeace’s original spirit of celebrating humanity was usurped by an anti-human Malthusian vision:
By the mid-1980s, Greenpeace had drifted from the original concept of green and peace — meaning environment and people, [to] save civilization from nuclear war — so we cared about people and had a humanitarian orientation as well as an environmental one. That was the marriage of green and peace, but by the time the eighties came along, the peace had kinda got lost and all it was was save-the-whales and save-the-earth, and now humans were being characterized as the enemies of nature, as if there’s too many of us and there shouldn’t be so many and people shouldn’t have children — and all this stuff that’s still coming up with AOC, now, telling people that maybe they shouldn’t have children because the world’s coming to an end.
LISTEN:
Moore recalled his departure from Greenpeace following the organization’s adoption of anti-human ideology:
So I don’t believe any of that stuff. At the highest level, I had to get out of Greenpeace at that point because my fellow directors were all pushing this narrative about humans being the enemies of the Earth. It’s way too much like Original Sin for me, where all the other life is good and only the humans are bad, and I just do not buy that. We’re from nature, just like all the other species are, and humans are mostly good. A few bad people make a big difference, it’s true, but people are mostly good and mostly try to be good. So I didn’t buy that.
Moore noted how his fellow Greenpeace directors, at the time of his departure, did not have scientific credentials or backgrounds.
“We basically got hijacked by extreme leftists or eco-fascists as they are sometimes referred to today. … We did a lot of good stuff but it went bad,” said Moore.
Greenpeace’s ostensibly environmental cause is a feature of the Democrat Party’s advocacy for halting “climate change,” explained Moore. He highlighted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) proposed Green New Deal as illustrative of the left’s “toxic mix” of politics, religion, and ideology:
The Democrats might as well sign a suicide pact, not just for their political future, but for the future of the economy of the United States for all these people to be piling on this Green New Deal, which is a complete and utter ridiculous document. To ban fossil fuels in ten years … first, food production would collapse, second, anybody trying to get food into the cities would fail, because the people on the outside of the cities would capture it so they could have it, and the people on the inside is where it would start. The rot would start in the center of the big cities where people would begin starve to death after they’d eaten all their pets. They would actually start killing and eating each other. It’s not just a religion, it’s a toxic mix of religion and ideology, of politics and religion. It’s just absolutely toxic. … They are against humans. Why would humans be against humans? Especially when we have developed such an incredible civilization.
Pompous little twit. You don’t have a plan to grow food for 8 billion people without fossil fuels, or get the food into the cities. Horses? If fossil fuels were banned every tree in the world would be cut down for fuel for cooking and heating. You would bring about mass death. — Patrick Moore (@EcoSenseNow) February 23, 2019
“The idea that we’re killing the Earth is crazy,” concluded Moore.

Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes.
“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice,” he said. “We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”
The actor then bore down on animal rights, specifically the life cycle of a cow.
“I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world, and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric worldview — the belief that we’re the center of the universe,” he said.
“We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take her milk, that’s intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal, and I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.”

A lawsuit percolating through the courts attempts to weigh the religious liberty of Orthodox Jews with a dire and compelling public health interest.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/new-york-city-good-legal-case-mandating-vaccines/,federalist,vaccines,right,10.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Five anonymous parents recently filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn Supreme Court against the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and its commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot. At issue is an emergency order making measles vaccinations mandatory, which opponents claim violates their religious beliefs.
Clearly, this is a highly sensitive issue, especially since the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn has been hit quite hard by this latest measles outbreak. Across New York City, just shy of 300 cases have been reported, many of those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. However, based on prior case law, the Brooklyn Supreme Court has compelling reason should it rule against the parents in this case.
In essence, the suit touches on the difficult question of when personal religious beliefs are outweighed by public safety concerns. According to the New York Post:
Mayor de Blasio on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over an outbreak of measles in Williamsburg and ordered mandatory vaccinations in the Brooklyn neighborhood under the threat of $1,000 fines — and even the possibility of forcible injections. The unprecedented move, which covers more than 212,000 people living in an area covered by four ZIP codes, followed the diagnoses of 285 cases of measles in the city — mostly in Williamsburg — since October. Under the order signed by Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, everyone who lives, works or attends school within the 11205, 11206, 11211 and 11249 ZIP codes and isn’t already immune to measles must be vaccinated within 48 hours. Parents are responsible for getting their children vaccinated, and the only exception is for people who can prove they ‘should be medically exempt.’ Health Department inspectors will also visit Jewish religious schools to make sure that yeshiva students who haven’t been vaccinated ‘are being appropriately excluded [from school] under this order,’ Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services Herminia Palacio said.
According to the Post, opponents to this order allege that the measles outbreak isn’t serious enough for the quick 48-hour vaccination requirement, since no deaths have been reported in the outbreak. They also allege that they are being forced to vaccinate for rubella and mumps, which they claim is risky, and that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine carries risks for children under 12 months of age and young women who may become pregnant.
The lawsuit claims that “the respondents’ emergency orders unnecessarily override the petitioners’ and their children’s religious practices and the children’s lawful exemptions from vaccination to attend school, which they have obtained in full compliance with Public Health.”
This is a very difficult issue, as it pits the right to individual autonomy, informed consent, and the free exercise of religion against the city’s need to protect the public. However, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s order appears to be somewhat well-supported from a legal perspective.
In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), the United States Supreme Court considered the issue of mandatory vaccinations with regard to a smallpox outbreak. In discussing the Jacobson case, the AMA Journal of Ethics explained:
There the Court ruled that the police power of a state absolutely included reasonable regulations established by legislature to protect public health and safety. Such regulations do not violate the 14th Amendment right to liberty because they fall within the many restraints to which every person is necessarily subjected for the common good. Real liberty for all cannot exist if each individual is allowed to act without regard to the injury that his or her actions might cause others; liberty is constrained by law. The Court went on to determine in Jacobson that a state may require vaccination if the board of health deems it necessary for public health or safety.
While people have varying opinions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, the question is whether such concerns and the decision not to vaccinate should outweigh the potential public health risks. The answer to this question, based on Jacobson, appears to be no. A subsequent question is whether the decision not to vaccinate based on deeply held religious beliefs should be protected when there is a risk or threat to the public.
Interestingly, as noted by Stat News, Jacobson did not involve a religious exemption from vaccination. In other words, the argument against mandatory vaccination revolved around the harmful effects of the smallpox shot on the plaintiff and his son. It had nothing to do with Jacobson’s religious beliefs.
According to Stat News, citing Wendy Parmet, a professor of public health law at Northeastern University, “multiple cases over the years have, if indirectly, created the impression that the Constitution does not enshrine the right to object to vaccination on religious grounds. It’s pretty clear there is no constitutional right to a religious exemption.” Moreover, according to The Jewish Star, some rabbis have opined that there are no legitimate religious grounds to oppose vaccination. There are, however, clear religious grounds to make vaccination of kids obligatory.
Undoubtedly, this case will slowly work its way through the court system. Of course, by the time it reaches the end of the road from a legal standpoint, the outbreak could be over. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the courts handle this difficult and very delicate legal issue.","['percolating', 'dire', 'compelling']"

As part of Pelosi’s coronavirus plan, House Democrats slipped in multiple measures from their H.R. 1 legislation that would implement nationwide ballot harvesting for federal elections — effectively allowing political operatives to collect and deliver an endless number of absentee ballots from voters.
Pelosi’s coronavirus plan allows “any person to return a voted and sealed absentee ballot” to a designated election office or post office and does not limit the number of absentee ballots that any one person can collect.
California is the only state in the United States to legalize ballot harvesting, though the practice occurs in other states as well. Pelosi’s coronavirus plan would legalize California-style ballot harvesting in every state for federal elections.
Pelosi’s coronavirus plan also mandates nationwide same-day voter registration, where eligible voters are allowed to register to vote on the same day as the 2020 presidential election and every federal election after that. Pelosi would also ban states from requiring voter registration applicants to provide more than the last four digits of their Social Security Numbers when applying to vote.
Likewise, Pelosi’s coronavirus plan mandates:
Early voting in every state for 15 consecutive days, open for at least 10 hours a day
Free mail-in absentee ballots for all registered voters
Expansion of election ballots in foreign languages
Pelosi’s coronavirus plan uses the pandemic to cram provisions of the House Democrats’ H.R. 1 legislation into federal law. That legislation went even further in its efforts to create loopholes for voter fraud, allowing convicted felons to vote in federal elections.
House Democrats on Monday blocked the passage of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which would have provided direct relief to American workers, citizens, and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus crisis.

Pamela Campusano, who works as a supervisor for the municipalities labour market unit, said that newly arrived women lacked driving licenses which pushed them away from labour market integration.
So far the local government has put forward 378,000 Swedish krona (£30,885/$40,537) for the project and according to Campusano, the project has already begun to show results.

Sweden: Around 90 Per Cent of 2015 Migrants with Residency Status Are Unemployed https://t.co/G4IhlnXBCx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2019
High unemployment numbers among foreign-born nationals have been an issue that has plagued Sweden for years, with reports often showing the migrant unemployment rate as being several times higher than that of native Swedes.
Figures regarding recent migrants, particularly those who have come to Sweden since the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, are even more severe. A report from October claimed that as many as 90 per cent of migrants with permanent residency status are unemployed.
In recent months, many municipal governments have also begun to feel significant financial pressures due to the lack of labour market integration of migrants combined with other factors such as an ageing population.
In the municipality of Filipstad, local politicians have complained that not only have recent migrants failed to get jobs in the area but many locals are leaving, creating a crisis in the already strained local tax base.

"Rather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/03/10/obama-considers-allowing-student-loans-to-be-wiped-out-in-bankruptcy/,breitbart,student-debt,right,10.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Obama has ordered the Department of Education and its network of federal agencies to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
The White House unveiled a “Student Aid Bill of Rights” on Tuesday, declaring every 18-year-old in America—regardless of ability or interest—must be granted access to a college education, must borrow money from the government to finance that education on a payback plan set by the government, and must be “treated fairly” by government debt collectors. Obama instructed federal agencies to “[clarify] the rights of Federal student loan borrowers in bankruptcy” and consider “possible changes to the treatment of loans in bankruptcy proceedings and when they were borrowed under fraudulent circumstances.”
With forty million Americans holding outstanding student loans worth $1.3 trillion, the White House’s proposal is fraught with difficulties.
On one hand, naive teenagers who signed off their financial futures to leftist, anti-American institutions would catch a break. The college cartel screwed you; now here’s a government waiver to make you forever grateful to the Democrats. The ferocity with which federal agencies pursue cancer patients and even Americans who already paid off their balance is disturbing.
On the other hand, the mad push to make college “affordable” has led to a relaxation of lending standards that makes the lead-up to the 2008 housing bubble look responsible. Minimal credit checks, no estimate of future earnings, no estimation of the job market four years down the road, and sometimes no co-signer—none of these impede many Americans from getting a loan.
The damages bankruptcy inflicts on debtors looks appealing to the twenty percent who say they’ll be in debt until they die. Obama’s proposed change could start a run that would greatly increase costs to the federal government and, by extension, taxpayers.
Currently, in order to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, a debtor must prove in court they will never be able to afford their monthly payments. That’s difficult to prove even for borrowers like pancreatic cancer victim Stacy Jorgensen, who was told by collectors from the Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) that the “mere possibility of recurrence is not enough” to allow her to discharge her debt as she underwent chemotherapy. (The survival rate for pancreatic cancer hovers between 19 and five percent.)
Democrats effectively nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 by transferring eight million loans into the federal government’s hands. Republicans claim that higher interest rates students pay on their debts will fund Obamacare to the tune of $8.7 billion, while the mainstream media charges that’s a lie.
Rather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government. Earlier this year, Obama raised the maximum amount students could borrow in Pell Grants another $1,000. His administration also streamlined the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), making it easier to borrow money from the government—which is also over $18 trillion in debt, a 70 percent increase since Obama took office in 2009. In June 2011, Obama issued an executive order that allowed five million debtors to cap their monthly payments to the government at 10 percent of their income—and see their loans forgiven in 20 years.
Obama’s memorandum may encourage more Americans to take on student loan debt instead of deflating the higher education bubble.

"Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, and with states like New York and Virginia among others pushing boundaries on abortion to extremes, the Republicans in Congress is rolling out a long-term push to force the Democrats to hold a vote on the bill.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/08/exclusive-house-gop-plans-sustained-effort-to-expose-leftist-democrats-on-abortion/amp/?__twitter_impression=true,breitbart,abortion,right,10.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"House Republicans are gearing up for a sustained push to expose leftist Democrats in the House Democrat majority on their increasingly extreme views on abortion, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.
Specifically, Republicans–as they have demonstrated for three consecutive legislative days–intend to push for a floor vote against Democrat Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s wishes on a piece of legislation from Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) that would ensure babies who are born alive following an abortion attempt are given the same medical treatment and care any other newborn baby would receive.
“Protecting innocent life shouldn’t be a partisan issue and it shouldn’t be difficult. Infanticide is barbaric and the growing trend of Democrats advocating it is frightening,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, told Breitbart News. “Republicans are united in seeing that a bill protecting babies who survived an attempted abortion urgently receives a vote on the House Floor. It already passed the House with Democratic support last Congress. But so far the new Democrat majority refuse to even consider the bill. But we will ask again. And again. And again, until this body speaks up for life.”
The House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, added in an emailed statement to Breitbart News that the Democrats’ extremism has been exposed and will continue to be shown to the public by the GOP’s sustained effort. Scalise said:
It’s absolutely barbaric that in this country it would be allowed to kill a baby after it’s born alive during an abortion, but that’s exactly what some elected Democrat leaders have advocated in recent weeks. Yesterday, the moral indifference of the House Democrat majority was on full display when they refused my motion to even give the Born Alive Survivors Protection Act a vote on the House Floor. Every American deserves to know if their representative stands against infanticide or not, and that’s why this week I began the discharge petition process that would force a vote on our bill. Now Democrats will have to make a choice: stand with the most radical elements of their base, or with the vast majority of Americans who are appalled at the murder of innocent life.
Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, added in an emailed statement to Breitbart News that Republicans are fighting “pure evil” on the part of those who would kill babies after being born.
Cheney told Breitbart News:
This is about killing babies after they are born and it is the face of pure evil. We’ve seen the leadership of the Democrat Party on the Hill remain silent while elected leaders, including the Governor of Virginia, describe in very cold, clinical terms how he would facilitate the murder of a baby that has already been born. I want to say personally, as a mother of five kids, the idea that we have to describe what the Democrats are doing, is really horrific. I want to ask mothers across this country to join with us to make sure that we don’t see our maternity wards turn into killing fields, which is what the Democrats would do if we don’t stop this. House Republicans are absolutely dedicated to stopping this, and dedicated to protecting the most vulnerable among us, which is the unborn. The notion that we’re having the debate about whether or not you should be able to kill babies is absolutely horrific and evil, and we will stand up against that.
Earlier this week, at a press conference, McCarthy and GOP leaders rolled out their push on the anti-infanticide bill from Wagner, recommitting their efforts to it. Last Congress, the bill was pushed in the House of Representatives by then-Congresswoman and now Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and it passed with bipartisan support. Six Democrats crossed the aisle to join all the Republicans in the then-GOP-led-majority in January 2018 to pass the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The bill did not make it in the Senate.
Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, and with states like New York and Virginia among others pushing boundaries on abortion to extremes, the Republicans in Congress is rolling out a long-term push to force the Democrats to hold a vote on the bill. Wagner, the Congresswoman from Missouri who has taken up the Blackburn bill mantle in the House, told Breitbart News that she is “proud” to push for a vote on this critical legislation protecting babies who are born alive surviving abortions.
“I was proud to introduce the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and help lead the discharge petition process to force a vote on this critical piece of legislation,” Wagner told Breitbart News. “Babies born alive deserve our protection and the proper medical care that any newborn would receive. I called for unanimous consent on the House Floor to bring this commonsense legislation up for a vote so we can protect these babies, but we were denied that vote. My colleagues and I will keep fighting for the precious life of these babies and we will keep calling for this vote so born-alive babies can receive lifesaving medical care when they are at their most vulnerable.”
The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, among other things, requires by law that healthcare professionals present at a live birth use their skills to preserve the life and health of a child at the same degree of care that would be offered to any child born prematurely at the same gestational age–and that after these efforts conclude, those healthcare professionals are legally responsible for the transportation and admission to a hospital. It also requires health officials to report any violations to law enforcement and penalizes intentional killing of born-alive children with various fines and up to five years in prison.
Leadership officials in the House GOP conference told Breitbart News that until the Democrats schedule a floor vote on this, on every legislative day when the House is in session, a different House Republican will go to the floor and ask for unanimous consent to have a vote on the bill.
Democrats have already blocked Republicans’ efforts three times. McCarthy tried on Wednesday, Scalise tried on Thursday, and Wagner tried on Friday. Cheney is expected to go to the floor next week, and many other members will get in the fight. There will be a different member each day pushing for unanimous consent on Wagner’s bill until Pelosi’s Democrat leadership team, which remains steadfastly in favor of not protecting babies born alive, cracks and allows a vote.
“This will force Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrat Majority to either go on record in blocking that request, or immediately proceed to passage of this important legislation,” a GOP leadership aide told Breitbart News.
Republicans say they will not be deterred and are ready for the long haul if necessary, because they believe that when the House votes on this bill protecting babies, many Democrats will be forced to–as six of them did in early 2018 when the Blackburn version of the bill passed the House on a bipartisan vote under Republican control–vote against their party leadership’s increasingly more extreme position on abortion.
Republicans are ready to take this request for unanimous consent on this bill to the floor, leadership aides say, every day that the House is in session for months and months–even more than a hundred days–if necessary.
The effort began on Wednesday, the day after President Donald Trump’s State of the Union addres in the very same chamber, where the president asked Congress to pass legislation protecting the most innocent lives–newborn babies and the unborn. Trump also criticized recent developments in New York, which made late-term abortions legal, and in Virginia, where the Democrat Governor Ralph Northam has come under serious fire for comments supporting abortion of a child during the birth of that child.
President Trump said:
Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
On Wednesday afternoon, after Wagner reintroduced the bill Wednesday morning and leadership touted it at a press conference, McCarthy went to the floor to push for a vote via unanimous consent. Pelosi’s designate in the Speaker’s chair that day, Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL), blocked the bill, saying Pelosi’s leadership team had not agreed to it.
Here’s video of the exchange between McCarthy and Pelosi’s designate:
Then, the next day, Scalise went to the floor and tried again. Pelosi’s designate, a different Democrat this time, blocked the GOP:
And Wagner tried again on Friday:
As each of these battles happens, McCarthy’s team and the rest of the GOP leadership are blasting out press releases to the national media highlighting the Democrat opposition to protecting babies from being killed during or after being born. Republicans also intend to push the message hard on social media, ripping Democrats for supporting what amounts to murder of babies already born:
According to a report in the Washington Post on Thursday, the GOP clearly views this as a winning issue politically–as it hands the Republicans the moral high ground on abortion, as the extremely radical view of killing a baby after he or she has been born–not when a baby is still in the womb–is so out there most of the country is aligned against it, even supporters of abortion.
Scalise is quoted in that Post story as saying the New York and Virginia developments on the life issue seem to have “woke a sleeping giant”– the movement of people across the country disgusted, outraged, and driven to action to protect human life from Democrats who could care less about it or would go so far as to pass laws stretching abortion to radical extremes.
The Northam comments hit America hard. He was making the case in favor of Virginia statehouse Delegate Kathy Tran’s bill that would allow abortion when a woman is going into labor–meaning as a baby is being born–and took it much, much further.
Northam, a Democrat, said in a radio interview with WTOP, adding:
This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers, physicians, and the mothers and fathers that are involved. When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician—more than one physician, by the way—and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s non-viable.
Northam, who was a doctor before he got into politics, then said that the child would be “kept comfortable” while doctors and parents made a decision whether or not to kill him or her. Northam said:
If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion. We want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.
Northam’s comments reportedly so outraged his medical colleagues that they leaked to the media photographs from his yearbook page in medical school that show two men in racially offensive garb–one in blackface, the other in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. Northan originally admitted one of the men was him but would not specify which, then walked back his admission and is now denying either of the men are him and refuses to resign despite nearly all of the Democrat Party nationally pushing for his resignation.
The scandal has rocked the Democrat Party nationally and reverberated heavily throughout Virginia, as not just Northam but both his presumed successors–next in line Democrat Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and the number three in line to the governor’s mansion, Democrat Attorney General Mark Herring–have been consumed by scandals of their own.
Fairfax has been hit with a pair of sexual assault allegations, including one woman who accused him of raping her. He denies the allegations despite calls from national Democrats for him to resign as well. Herring has admitted he too donned blackface in his college days. Herring had previously called on Northam to resign over Northam’s admission at a press conference that he wore blackface at a different time than the photo that appeared in his yearbook.
Republicans’ renewed focus on abortion in the wake of both the New York and Virginia developments–among others nationwide–has widespread public support. Recent polling shows that the public wants restrictions on abortion, and wants Roe v. Wade reinterpreted so as to allow for restrictions:
What’s more, Democrats who have embraced radical and extreme late-term abortion policy views in recent weeks–not just Northam–have come under fire. New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo, another Democrat who is reportedly considering running for president in 2020, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times defending his state’s radical new law by saying: “I am a former altar boy.”
“My Roman Catholic values are my personal values. The decisions I choose to make in my life, or in counseling my daughters, are based on my personal moral and religious beliefs,” Cuomo wrote, backing the law by saying his oath is not to his personal beliefs but to the law and the Constitution.","['pushing', 'boundaries', 'extremes']"

According to the Marist poll and its partner, the Knights of Columbus, the survey demonstrates that the label “pro-choice” can be deceptive when it is interpreted to mean supportive of abortion at any point in pregnancy.
A new KofC/Marist poll on American attitudes toward abortion finds that overwhelming majorities support substantial restrictions on abortion, and would like to see Roe v. Wade reinterpreted to allow restrictions. https://t.co/YW1y7rEWFx pic.twitter.com/6nQNNYHBHI — Knights of Columbus (@KofC) January 15, 2019
“As in past years, this poll shows that the pro-choice label on the abortion issue is simply insufficient,” said Knights of Columbus CEO Carl Anderson. “The majority of Americans – in both parties – support legal restrictions on abortion. Two-thirds of Americans want Roe revisited to allow for state regulation of abortion or to ban it altogether. The majority of the American people deserve to have their opinions heard.”
According to the poll, 75 percent of Americans say abortion should be limited to — at most — the first three months of pregnancy. Among those who identify as Republicans, 92 percent want that restriction, as do 78 percent of independents and 60 percent of Democrats. Perhaps most significantly, that view is shared by 61 percent of those who identify as “pro-choice.”
In addition, the survey finds 65 percent of Americans say if the Supreme Court revisits Roe v. Wade, the high court should either return the issue of the legality of abortion to the states (49 percent) or outlaw the procedure altogether (16 percent). Only 30 percent of those surveyed would prefer that the Supreme Court rule in favor of unrestricted abortion.
Regarding taxpayer funding of the procedure, 54 percent oppose any taxpayer funding of abortion, while 39 percent support it.
On the issue of taxpayer funding of the procedure overseas, the poll finds 75 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding abroad, through non-governmental organizations such as International Planned Parenthood, with only 19 percent in favor of such funding. When political affiliation is a factor, 94 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents, and 56 percent of Democrats oppose taxpayer funding of abortion overseas.
When asked if medical professionals with moral objections to abortion should be permitted to opt out of performing them, 55 percent of those surveyed agreed, while 35 percent did not agree.
The majority of Americans (62 percent) oppose abortions for unborn babies with Down Syndrome. Additionally, 59 percent are in favor of banning the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except to save the life of the mother.
When questions regarding the nature of the unborn are asked, 56 percent of Americans say, “scientifically,” a fetus is “a unique life,” while 35 percent say it is “part of a woman’s body.” Additionally, 42 percent say life begins at conception while 13 percent say life begins at birth.
“Most Americans also believe that laws can protect both the mother and her unborn child (83 percent to 10 percent).”
The survey of 1,066 adults was conducted January 8-10 using landline or mobile phone numbers. Results are statistically significant within plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
A poll released Monday by Students for Life of America also found that labels such as “pro-life” and “pro-choice” can hide what Millennials actually prefer in terms of policy on abortion.
That poll revealed that 70 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 support limits on abortion, with 42 percent opposing the procedure broadly.
Despite the image portrayed of popular culture in the media, of those Millennials surveyed, only seven percent supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by taxpayer dollars — the position embraced by the Democrat Party.",['embraced']
"Top Democrats running for president in 2020 have jumped on and endorsed Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s radical Green New Deal that aims, among other things, to eliminate air travel.",,fox-news,environment,right,11.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Top Democrats running for president in 2020 have jumped on and endorsed Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s radical Green New Deal that aims, among other things, to eliminate air travel.
But the elimination of air travel strikes particularly close to the homes of Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris – all of whom extensively used air travel, including private jets – throughout the years in office.
GREEN NEW DEAL: OCASIO-CORTEZ AIMS TO MAKE AIR TRAVEL OBSOLETE, AID THOSE ‘UNWILLING’ TO WORK
Harris, among the leading Democratic candidates in the 2020 race so far, has been an early backer of Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution to tackle climate change by radically transforming the country by rendering air travel obsolete, moving the U.S. to rely completely on renewable energy with net-zero emissions, and guaranteeing economic security even for people who are “unwilling” to work.
“I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal. We must aggressively tackle climate change which poses an existential threat to our nation,” she tweeted, adding in that “The Green New Deal is a bold plan to shift our country to 100% clean and renewable energy.”
Yet Harris herself is far from following what she preaches. Since 2015, her campaign has spent around $300,000 on air travel.
Harris’ FEC records also show that she spent less than $7,000 on trains, even though the Green New Deal proposes making trains the main means of transport “at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.”
She is, however, an outlier compared to the three other Democrats when it comes to private jets, with no records or media reports indicating that she took a chartered flight.
Still, Harris’ lavish spending on airline tickets – with many of them first-class tickets – even became a campaign issue in 2015 during her Senate run, as the travel also included first-rate hotels around the country all while her staffers had to fly budget and stay in low-end rooms.
Booker is another 2020 candidate who immediately jumped on the Green New Deal without delving too much on the details, even though he also extensively relies on air travel.
His campaign records show that at least $300,000 were spent on air travel since 2013 by his campaign. He spent just about $11,000 on Amtrak – the Green New Deal’s preferred mode of transport.
While public records don’t clearly indicate whether Booker spent money on chartered flights, multiple media reports have indicated Booker occasionally travels using chartered flights.
CORY BOOKER COMPARES GREEN NEW DEAL TO GOING TO THE MOON, DEFEATING NAZIS
The New Jersey Democrat defended his support for the proposal on Friday, comparing it to the government-led push to overhaul the nation’s economy and energy sector to landing on the moon and defeating the Nazis in World War II.
“There's a lot of people now going back on the Green New Deal, they're like 'oh it's impractical, oh it's too expensive, oh it's all of this,'” he said at a stop in Mason City, Iowa. “If we used to govern our dreams that way, we would have never gone to the Moon. 'God, that's impractical. See that ball in the sky? That's impractical.'”
Gillibrand, a New York Democrat and a close friend of Booker, is also backing the Green New Deal, despite being one of the worst offenders when it comes to air travel.
“A #GreenNewDeal is ambitious. It's bold. And I’m cosponsoring this resolution with @aoc and @senmarkey because it’s exactly the kind of action it will take to conquer the biggest threat of our lifetime,” she tweeted.
But Gillibrand has long been criticized for her extensive use of private jets. A Fox News review of public records reveal that Gillibrand’s campaign spent at least $439,000 on air charter company Zen Air between 2010 and 2017. In the last decade, her campaign also spent an additional $465,000 on non-charter flights.
The New York senator doesn’t always charge her campaign for the travel. She charged American taxpayers $93,098 in 2013 and $194,797 in 2012 for chartered flights, according to Senate financial documents, the USA Today reported. She ranked just below her fellow Democrat Chuck Schumer, who hasn’t endorsed the Green New Deal.
Lastly, Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who long fought for against climate change, is one of the original backers of Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal.
“I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal proposal. We must address the existential crisis of planetary climate change, while at the same time creating millions of good-paying jobs in our country,” he wrote.
While Sanders hasn’t yet declared his candidacy for president in 2020, he likely to face attacks even from other progressives for his excessive use air travel.
Just last October, Sanders reportedly spent $300,000 on private air travel just so he could speak to people in nine battleground states prior to November's midterm elections.
Sanders’ 2018 campaign committee issued an Oct. 10 payment of $297,685 to New York-based Apollo Jets, a charter jet company used by retired sports stars Derek Jeter and Shaquille O’Neal, according to federal campaign reports obtained by VTDigger.org, a watchdog news site in Vermont.
Since 2015, his Senate campaign also spent an additional $100,000 on air travel. Sanders also ran for Democratic Party’s nomination for president in 2016, meaning some of the travel costs were made on behalf of the presidential campaign.

"As shown below, women are harmed by Planned Parenthood, and the vulnerable––such as sex abuse victims and the unborn––are sacrificed for profit and political advance.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/15/8-nonpartisan-reasons-defund-planned-parenthood/,federalist,abortion,right,11.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Planned Parenthood engages in taxpayer waste, covering up sex abuse scandals, and hypocritical lobbying on issues of speech. Plus, it's not needed.
House Democrats want to reinstate international abortion funding. Planned Parenthood’s new CEO, Leana Wen, is focusing on abortion as the forefront of Planned Parenthood’s offerings and goals. And the March for Life is this Friday, where tens of thousands––perhaps even hundreds of thousands––of people will protest abortion in Washington DC.
The fact is that political parties are going to keep fighting on abortion. Republicans will claim that they prioritize pro-life policies, even though they didn’t defund Planned Parenthood or pass any federal bans when they controlled Congress and the White House. Meanwhile, Democrats will keep abortion sacrosanct.
Both parties are wrong: abortion should be ended. The first step to this should be a bipartisan ending of Planned Parenthood’s funding. To quote March For Life President Jeanne Mancini about America’s largest abortion company, “protecting vulnerable, unborn citizens should be a bipartisan goal.”
Planned Parenthood dominates the Democratic Party, even though Planned Parenthood violates a number of the party’s core principles. As shown below, women are harmed by Planned Parenthood, and the vulnerable––such as sex abuse victims and the unborn––are sacrificed for profit and political advance.
“Both parties ought to unite around redirecting” Planned Parenthood’s funding, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an email to me. She noted that other facilities offer all of Planned Parenthood’s non-abortion services and “vastly outnumber” the abortion giant’s locations.
Since SCOTUS showed last month that it is not willing to risk political controversy by hearing state-level defunding cases, it’s important that pro-life advocates create more of our kind to gain political advantage across all levels of government. To that end, here are eight nonpartisan reasons Planned Parenthood should be defunded.
1. The Unborn Are the Most Vulnerable People
The main argument for abortion is that what occupies a pregnant womb is not a human being. But science proves that unborn life begins in the womb. From Just Facts* comes proof––not the organization’s own opinion, but 10 original sources provided in just the short section below. Readers can click to each source from the numbered hyperlink to verify the original citation:
Fertilization normally takes place within one day of intercourse but can occur up to six days later. [34] [35]
At fertilization, humans’ genetic composition is formed. [36] This genetic information determines gender, eye color, hair color, and facial features. It also influences characteristics such as intelligence and personality. [37]
Per the medical textbook “The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology”: “fertilization” creates “a new combination of chromosomes that is different from that in the cells of either of the parents,” and this marks the “beginning of a new human being.” [38]
The four characteristics of life (growth, reproduction, metabolism, and response to stimuli) are present at fertilization. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43]
Unborn children feel pain, react to their surroundings, and have their own distinct blood. Their helplessness makes them the most vulnerable of all humans, a demographic Democrats stake their reputations on protecting.
This is the best reason Planned Parenthood should be defunded. It kills more than 320,000 human beings each year, according to its annual reports.
2. Planned Parenthood Covers Up Sex Abuse
Planned Parenthood has been accused by the pro-life group Live Action of hiding sex abuse. Live Action has undercover videos and personal testimonies to make its case. Planned Parenthood says Live Action is lying. It also has materials showing its support for survivors of sexual assault.
However, state officials in Alabama discovered that a Planned Parenthood center in Mobile covered up the suspected abuse of a 14-year-old girl. The girl already had two children and went to the center for two abortions in four months in 2014.
I spoke to a senior Alabama health official who defended giving Planned Parenthood a light punishment. Like every other state in the nation, Alabama requires health workers to report suspected abuse of minors. Planned Parenthood’s Mobile location didn’t do that. The official told me his department believed it was an error.
I asked the official if “essentially, your department was satisfied [Planned Parenthood] had acted in good faith, and not intentionally hid this information’ from child protective services.”
The official said that what I described was accurate. He also asked me to frame the situation differently to avoid pressure by the state’s pro-life advocates, saying it “would be much better” if LifeSiteNews “could word [the situation]in a way that [Planned Parenthood] had considered the possibility [of abuse] but simply hadn’t reported it, and after review with senior management, they are revising their policies, and they did report it, and they will report similar instances in the future.”
Got that? Alabama officials believed Planned Parenthood’s Mobile location accidentally broke a state law designed to protect minors, and that this should excuse their lack of protecting an abused minor.
3. Hurting Women In Other Ways
Did you know that research shows contraceptives can cause blood clots, death, glaucoma, gestational diabetes, breast cancer, depression, and general pain for women? Planned Parenthood acknowledges but downplays many such risks of contraceptives. Despite these risks, it gave out almost 2.7 million various contraceptives to women in 2016.
Planned Parenthood also ends the lives of about 6.6 percent of girls who would otherwise be born each year. The full calculations for that number may be seen here. About 157,000 unborn girls are denied the right to leave the womb and become women.
This 6.6 percent does not include sex-selective abortions. There is evidence this happens domestically. Planned Parenthood’s California chapter opposed a sex-selective abortion ban, even though the national Planned Parenthood says it opposes sex-selective abortions.
These numbers also do not include the many abortions that may be caused by several of the federally approved contraceptives that double as abortion-inducing drugs or devices.
One person who has seen firsthand how women are hurt by Planned Parenthood is Lauren Handy. A dedicated advocate for women considering abortion, she told me that she “purposely live[s] below the poverty line” so as to not support Planned Parenthood with tax dollars.
Handy said her activism started after “a woman just coming out of her abortion” was holding “her womb area in pain as her boyfriend dragged her along.” Handy “dropped out of college, sold all my belongings, and became a full-time pro-life missionary.” She holds signs in front of abortion centers which show graphic images of abortion victims, “medical diagrams of what the abortion procedure actually entails,” and provides non-abortive resources for desperate women.
4. Illegally Selling Baby Parts
Planned Parenthood has denied illegally selling baby body parts. These denials came despite federal and state criminal referrals and investigations. The district attorney in Orange County, California filed charges against two companies that allegedly partnered with Planned Parenthood. Those companies settled for almost $8 million, admitted fault, and stopped their work in California.
A court order has prevented any more of the Center for Medical Progress’s (CMP) videos, which allegedly show Planned Parenthood engaging in illegal activity, from being released. CMP lead investigator David Daleiden told me these videos “will be the final confirmation that Planned Parenthood and their business partners are guilty.”
If you haven’t watched the CMP videos, which were released in 2015, please do so. In one of them, baby body parts are piled like slabs of meat. Stopping this shouldn’t be controversial.
5. Medicaid Fraud And Taxpayer Waste
Congress should cut all inefficient and illegally spent money. This includes monies misspent by Planned Parenthood, an organization Dannenfelser described as “perpetually mired in scandals.”
For example, the Texas attorney general’s office found evidence that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (PPGC) engaged in fraud. PPGC denied the claims in 2013. It settled the case for $1.4 million. Wisconsin auditors found overpayments in 2014 at five Planned Parenthood centers and three other abortion centers.
Finally, the Alliance Defending Freedom and Charlotte Lozier Institute examined dozens of state audits and three federal audits, which show that Planned Parenthood centers across the country waste millions of taxpayer dollars. Even the state of New York––an abortion-friendly state––targeted Planned Parenthood in 2009 for overbilling.
Planned Parenthood For America did not respond to a request for comment about the audits and investigations.
6. Free Speech And Private Property Hypocrisy
Elected officials promise to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and public programs are subject to its protections. Despite receiving more than $540 million in public money, however, Planned Parenthood does not support free speech for all citizens.
For example, Planned Parenthood has sued to stop state and federal defunding efforts. It argues that eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood puts its rights and those of its clients at risk.
Yet Planned Parenthood backed a California law that would have forced pro-life centers to refer for abortion. Planned Parenthood wanted to force private citizens to speak their message. It also backed another California law that restricted the ability of journalists to engage in undercover investigations.
This hypocrisy also applies to property rights. Planned Parenthood backed the mobs which were arrested on Capitol Hill last year, saying “protest is patriotic.” Likewise, in 2014, people affiliated with the organization handed out condoms on Hobby Lobby property in protest of Hobby Lobby’s successful lawsuit against the Obama administration’s contraception mandate.
But again, Planned Parenthood seems to think protests are patriotic only when they support their narrative. Pro-life advocates outside of Planned Parenthood centers had to fight all the way to the Supreme Court in 2013 to be allowed within 35 feet of abortion centers in Massachusetts. Planned Parenthood lost that case, but it has consistently urged lawmakers to ban pro-life advocates from using public property for free speech.
7. Planned Parenthood Isn’t Needed
Public dollars should only be spent where necessary. While reasonable people can disagree on the existence of many federal and state programs, eliminating Planned Parenthood’s public sinecure is easy to justify on the basis that it is not necessary.
Pro-life pregnancy resource centers take care of pregnant women better than Planned Parenthood can. First, these centers provide free ultrasounds, maternity housing, adoption assistance, clothes, diapers, and more for women in desperate circumstances. Planned Parenthood charges for many of its services.
Second, pro-life centers outnumber abortion clinics. Best of all for those who are concerned about fiscal matters, most are privately funded, which protects taxpayers. In fact, taxpayers see a net benefit from pro-life centers. Citing a Charlotte Lozier Institute study published in 2018, Heartbeat International Director of Communications Andrea Trudden told me, “In 2017 alone, pregnancy help centers served more than 2 million women and men in the United States, saving taxpayers more than $161 million.”
Life Advancement Group* co-founder Benjamin Kraft said in an email that “these centers support women in many different situations, from first-time expecting mothers to single moms with multiple kids who are struggling to make ends meet.” According to Kraft, one center “provided more than 1,600 medical and support services to women in need” with just a $250,000 budget.
For Planned Parenthood’s other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and breast exams, federally-qualified health centers provide them. And it is these centers which pro-life groups have, for years, urged federal lawmakers to redirect Planned Parenthood’s funding because these centers provide other non-abortive services such as contraceptives.
So, again, clearly Planned Parenthood-specific funding isn’t necessary because what Planned Parenthood offers is either immoral or provided elsewhere. But it is also the case that some of the dollars should be eliminated from the federal budget forthwith instead of being redirected.
Such immoral ends should never be funded by the public. Additionally, rather than reduce abortion rates, research shows that widely available birth control increases the prevalence of abortion, above and beyond the abortion-inducing potential of several drugs and devices.
The least expensive and most effective option for birth control is abstinence. It’s free, and it’s 100 percent effective in all consensual circumstances. It is also the solution that calls upon adults to engage in sexual intercourse as adults instead of like children who feel entitled to using someone else’s money in their bedroom.
8. Planned Parenthood Uses Public Money For Political Advocacy
If the list above isn’t enough, Planned Parenthood uses taxpayer money to fund tens of millions of dollars of political advocacy. This is a favorite bipartisan activity. Politicians regularly give your money to their favored corporations, unions, and non-profit “charities” that are actually political advocacy groups.
Eliminating Planned Parenthood’s federal funding should be part of a bipartisan effort to clean house. Making our government smaller would ensure that tax dollars are used far more efficiently––whether for folks concerned about abortion, corporate farm subsidies, or our oversized Department of Defense. It would also reduce the influence of outside groups on our elected officials.

The cost of college tuition is increasing at the same time the federal government is originating and managing 93 percent of all student loans and has launched a liberal student loan forgiveness program – all of which means the burden of increasing amounts of student debt has been taken up by taxpayers at the same time average college students are spending less time with their studies.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/07/22/full-time-college-students-spend-19-hours-weekly-studies-29-hours-leisure/,breitbart,student-debt,right,11.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"A new report finds that the average full-time college student spends 19 hours per week on education-related activities and 29 hours per week on socializing and leisure activities.
Heritage Foundation education researchers Lindsey Burke, Jamie Bryan Hall, and Mary Clare Reim conducted an analysis of college students’ time use to demonstrate to taxpayers footing the bill for federal student aid how their tax dollars are being spent.
Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey from 2003-2014, the researchers found that, on average, the demands of full-time enrollment in college are substantially less than those for either high school or full-time employment.
On a daily basis, average full-time college students spend 2.76 hours on education and class-related activities and 4.4 hours on social and leisure activities.
The cost of college tuition is increasing at the same time the federal government is originating and managing 93 percent of all student loans and has launched a liberal student loan forgiveness program – all of which means the burden of increasing amounts of student debt has been taken up by taxpayers at the same time average college students are spending less time with their studies.
The researchers note:
Students are accruing more debt to earn a bachelor’s degree, and the burden of loan repayment is increasingly being shifted to taxpayers. Not only do taxpayers bear the burden of defaults, but thanks to an expansion of federal loan forgiveness programs, they are also responsible for an increasing number of student loans that now qualify for forgiveness… The limited amount of time spent engaged in education-related activities on average suggests that, for some students, the amount of debt accumulated finances a significant amount of non-education hours. When loans are forgiven, then, both education and non-education time is financed by taxpayers. Although numerous exogenous factors play into time to degree, such as when courses are offered and the mitigating circumstances of individual students, time-use data suggest that taxpayers end up generously subsidizing the non-education time of many college students.
“If we want federal taxpayers to forgive student loans, we need to realize they will be forgiving a lot of leisure time,” says Heritage Foundation education fellow Burke.","['liberal', 'burden']"

In 2019 the number of migrants attempting to enter the UK illegally by crossing the English Channel surged to 2,358, quadrupling the number of 2018, which saw 586 people attempting the perilous sea journey across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.
French authorities report that 261 migrant filled boats, which are typically undersized, overloaded and ill-equipped to deal with the heavily trafficked and icy waters of the channel, attempted to make the crossing, leading to four deaths last year, reports The Guardian.
Of the total, some 1,892 migrants successfully reached British shores last year, according to The Standard. The figure is twice as many as the year prior, many of whom were brought to Dover by UK Border Force.
The news comes after 43 migrants from Iraq, Iran, and Afganistan were brought to Dover after attempting to cross in three small boats.
Last week, Breitbart London reported that a former immigration chief blamed the surge in migrant crossings on increased border patrols on the channel.
“The more Border Force cutters there are in the Channel the more attractive it is for those setting sail in small boats. They know they will be picked up and taken to the UK. For them that is mission accomplished,” said David Wood, former immigration enforcement at the Home Office.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said that in response to the surge of illegal migrants, the government will look into how to speed up the deportation process, possibly to be modelled on Australia’s uncompromising system which saw a steep decline in illegal migration under the Commonwealth’s “stop the boats” policy.
“When there is an incentive, people will find ways to get here, whether it is in lorries, small boats or any other means. If they know they are going to be promptly returned they will stop coming,” a Home Office spokesman told The Telegraph.
In 2018 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK agreed to pay France £44.5 million to install border fencing and surveillance systems at Calais and other French ports where migrants set sail from. The United Kingdom had previously paid £100 million to France to increase border security.

The law is meant to put forth the “fundamental right” to abortion and end protections from babies in the womb up to birth.
Lifesite News reported:
The state Senate voted 38-24 in favor of the so-called “Reproductive Health Act” Tuesday evening, the Albany Times-Union reports, a bill that has repeatedly cleared the state Assembly in years past but been blocked by the formerly-Republican Senate. Following the Senate vote, the Assembly passed it 92-47. “We have a president who’s made it very, very clear that he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade,” Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins declared before the vote. “Today, here in New York, we are saying no […] and we’re not just saying no. We’re saying that here in New York, women’s health matters. We’re saying here in New York, women’s lives matter. We’re saying here in New York, women’s decisions matter.”
Here are eight facts about New York’s new abortion law:
– The “fundamental” right to abortion is enshrined in the New York Constitution. “Every individual who becomes pregnant has the fundamental right to choose to carry the pregnancy to term, to give birth to a child, or to have an abortion, pursuant to this article,” the law states.
– The law allows non-physicians to perform abortions. “A health care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized under title eight of the education law, acting in his or her lawful scope of practice, may perform an abortion,” the law states.
– The law allows abortion through the third trimester, including up to birth. “Third-trimester abortion will be allowed under the new law when a preborn child is diagnosed with a condition that will cause him or her to die at or shortly after birth,” Live Action reported.
– The law removes protections for babies who survive an abortion procedure. “The new law removes protections for babies born alive after an abortion — meaning they could be left to die after birth — by rescinding a portion of New York’s public health law,” Live Action reported. Late-term abortions, until now, were illegal in the state of New York.
– The law prevents pregnant women whose babies are killed in an attack on the mother from seeking justice and could result in infanticide by repealing the requirement for a second physician to be on hand in case an attempted abortion past 20 weeks yields a live infant.
– The law states that an unborn child cannot be a victim of homicide if he dies while in the womb following an attack on the mother. “‘Person,’ when referring to the victim of a homicide, means a human being who has been born and is alive,” the law states.
– Pro-abortion advocates said the law would protect legal abortion even in the event that the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to make abortion legal — a decision that did no go as far as the New York law. “[The law] not only increases access to abortion across the board, including late-term abortions but also goes beyond Roe, which left some limits in place,” Catholic News Service reported.
– The law is to “prevent the enforcement of laws or regulations that are not in furtherance of a legitimate state interest in protecting a woman’s health that burden abortion access.”

"Thus far in the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has flippantly downplayed the threat from China, only to quickly walk back his comments when he faced backlash.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/29/heres-25-questions-joe-biden-needs-to-answer-about-china/,federalist,vaccines,right,11.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Will Biden disavow his decades of support for China’s rise and follow Trump’s lead?
Communist China poses a greater threat to America and our interests abroad than any other nation in the world.
If it wasn’t clear prior to the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, resulting largely from the Chinese Communist Party’s Chernobyl-like response, the subsequent threats should crystallize this point. It has acted malevolently toward the U.S., our European and Anglosphere allies, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India, and across the South China Sea.
Countering the CCP is essential to preserving American life, limb, and liberty. The public deserves to know what presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s approach to China would be.
After all, this is a man who sat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for three decades. Biden ultimately chaired or served as its ranking member from 1997 on, during a career at the senior-most levels of government spanning almost the entirety of U.S.-China engagement. As a longtime senator and then vice president, Biden never once acted to scuttle the integrationist-accommodationist policy that has left America in such a perilous position.
This is to say nothing of the disturbing appearance of corruption surrounding Biden’s tenure as vice president, in which he managed the “China portfolio,” while his son Hunter contemporaneously entered into an apparent sweetheart Chinese investment deal.
Thus far in the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has flippantly downplayed the threat from China, only to quickly walk back his comments when he faced backlash. He attacked the Trump administration for “xenophobia” in enacting a travel ban early in the coronavirus crisis, only later to backtrack on that too. Now, Biden is trying a new tack: Portray himself as tougher on China than Trump.
This assertion is belied by his historical rhetoric and action, in contrast with a Trump administration that explicitly rejected the status quo by way of its national security strategy. That strategy notes the flaws of a premise to which Biden has long subscribed — that “engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners” — and the Trump administration has acted accordingly.
The former vice president must tell us whether his views and policy prescriptions have markedly changed, or if his presidency would represent a reversion to the status quo ante.
Here are 23 questions the press ought to ask him but almost certainly won’t:
1. Does Biden still believe, as he remarked during a 2011 speech, that “a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large”?
2. Does Biden regret his support for granting permanent normal trade relations to China, setting it up for accession to the World Trade Organization that would supercharge its drive toward superpower status?
3. Does Biden believe the Obama administration’s responses, or lack thereof, to China’s rampant theft of intellectual property, militarization of the South China Sea, catastrophic hack of the Office of Personnel Management, and liquidation of Central Intelligence Agency assets were sufficient, and successfully checked China’s ambitions? If not, what would he have done differently? Did he propose such alternatives as vice president?
4. Does Biden disavow the Obama administration’s signing of a 2013 memorandum of understanding — following intense lobbying of the former vice president by Chinese leaders — granting Chinese companies continued access to U.S. capital markets, in spite of their unique noncompliance in skirting basic auditing and reporting requirements, resulting in numerous frauds?
5. Does the former vice president think it appropriate for former Obama administration national security officials to lobby on behalf of Huawei, the CCP-tied, national security-threatening, alleged U.S.-lawbreaking linchpin of China’s plan for control over global communications?
6. Will Biden disclose any and all funding directly or indirectly emanating from Chinese sources for the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement?
7. Would a President-Elect Biden take a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s president, and express ambiguity regarding the “One China” policy prior to dealing with the CCP?
8. Would a Biden administration explicitly recognize the ruling CCP as a “Marxist-Leninist Party,” “hostile to the United States,” that harbors hegemonic ambitions?
9. More fundamentally, would a Biden administration recognize that China poses the greatest threat of all to America?
10. Would every member of a Biden Cabinet adopt policies geared toward countering China, or ceasing cooperation with it?
11. Would a President Biden continue the Trump administration’s military buildup aimed at countering China’s aggression?
12. Specifically, would a President Biden prioritize significant funding of missile defense and the Space Force in his budgets?
13. Would a President Biden continue to vacate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty?
14. Would a President Biden continue accelerating naval activities throughout the Indo-Pacific?

Anti-vaxxers represent only about 2 percent of American families, although you’d be forgiven for thinking they’re more numerous. They certainly make a lot of noise and have some world-famous adherents. However, like malaria-carrying mosquitoes, this tiny group that punches above its weight may be on the verge of creating a public health problem for us all.
Peter J. Hotez, a pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine and director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, recently took to The New York Times to warn that we could see an outbreak of measles, “one of the most contagious and most lethal of all human diseases,” this year. In fact, based on this January article in the Los Angeles Times, it looks like Hotez’s prediction has already begun materializing in California.
Measles, which was considered eradicated in the United States as recently as 2000, isn’t a retro-chic trend worth reviving. “15 people die every hour worldwide from measles, according to the World Health Organization,” notes the Los Angeles Times. Yet, like some deadly cat with nine lives, measles is making its American come-back.
Herd Immunity Is Serious
Recall the 2014 measles outbreak at Disneyland. In spite of knowing that “145 people in the U.S. and about a dozen others in Canada and Mexico” became infected, some parents remain firm vaccine opponents. According to Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California at Davis, the vaccination exemption rate increased from 1.7 percent in 2014-5 to 1.9 percent in 2015-6 nationally among kindergarteners, although he adds that “states are inconsistent in how they measure this, and state laws and regulations have been changing” — as they should.
If you’re the parent of an immuno-compromised child, or perhaps of an infant — as I am — Hotez’s warning is chilling. With the benefits of modern aviation, no community and its diseases are ever completely isolated, unless there’s a formal quarantine.
I intend to vaccinate my daughter, but she’s still too young for most of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ immunization schedule. That means we’re relying on herd immunity for her safety.
The national vaccination rate currently hovers around 95 percent, but Blumberg explains it must be more like 96 percent going forward for herd immunity to fully operate. As more families with healthy, older children opt out of immunizations, how can you protect a child who can’t (yet) be vaccinated? For those who may also be in my boat, I posed that question to some medical experts.
How to Recognize Measles
The first tip? Arm yourself with information. Most American parents with young children have never personally encountered measles, so they wouldn’t recognize it. Dr. Grant Christman, an assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine (and my college friend), recommends starting with the Centers for Disease Control and WHO websites.
It’s important to know “that the rash isn’t the first thing you see. Kids start off with fever, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis (pink/red eyes), so early on, measles can look like a lot of other common viruses.”
Next, there is some good news. Infants with vaccinated mothers are born with preliminary protection. Blumberg explains that a mother passes along her immunity “primarily during the third trimester. So the children are born with some protection against these diseases. The maternal antibodies decay over time, but they serve as a critical bridge of protection while the child[’s] . . . immune system matures.”
Talk to Your Child’s Doctor
As a parent, you also have some leverage, assuming you live near more than one pediatrician. Christman notes that while some pediatricians accept vaccine-refusing patients and others do not, your family can always vote with your feet: “If your pediatrician keeps vaccine refusing patients, there is a greater chance your baby will be exposed to measles and other preventable diseases during well child visits. I would guess that most pediatricians up until now have felt more pressure from vaccine refusing parents than from the rest of us. This won’t change until parents who vaccinate start asking their pediatricians about this prior to being seen at their practice.” So if this matters to you, say something.
Stay Away from Contagious People
Dr. Avigayil Elkin, a pediatrician in New Jersey, further advised: “MMR can’t be given before age one for it to ‘count’ for school purposes, but we do give MMR as early as six months in special circumstances- overseas travel would be one of them. . . . just get the baby immunized on time according to the recommended schedule and limit time spent in crowded or close public environments whenever possible when the baby is very young.”
The crowds and public places are, of course, a real challenge, if you’re accustomed to using public transportation or have older kids too, like my family. So, what should parents do there?
Blumberg suggested several things. First, “95% of kindergarteners in the U.S. have received the MMR vaccine (per the CDC, 2015-6 school year). But the immunization rate varies from 87 percent to 99 percent by state” and by individual community. So Blumberg advises parents to think about this issue on a local basis.
For starters, ask about vaccination rates before choosing your child’s day care facility or school district. Ensure that those frequently interacting with your child, including family members and regular caregivers, are vaccinated.
Second, avoid being around people who are ill, by choosing caregiving settings with rules about keeping sick children home and declining play dates with anyone who is ill. Blumberg acknowledges this is easier said than done. He suggests letting friends and family know this is a priority for your family.
Third, pick a pediatrician who segregates healthy and ill children in the waiting room, so your healthy child doesn’t leave a well visit feeling sick.
Fourth, there’s the matter of diet. Breastfeeding protects infants and toddlers. While “for older children, a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will assure adequate vitamins and micronutrients (such as selenium and zinc) that are important for immune function.”
Talk to Your Elected Officials
Finally, if you’re in an activist mood, contact the new secretary of Health and Human Services and the new secretary of Education and ask them to speak out on this. Also, investigate whether you live in a state where personal belief exemptions are freely granted. If so, consider calling your state legislators and urging them to introduce legislation requiring vaccinations for kindergarteners who don’t qualify for medical exemptions.
California previously had lax vaccination legislation, but it “is now one of three states that forbid children from opting out of vaccines because of religious or personal beliefs.” That’s certainly a start. Now, we just need to encourage reluctant parents everywhere: If you have children healthy enough to vaccinate, do it. You’ll be protecting your own kids, along with everybody else’s.","['noise', 'malaria-carrying', 'mosquitoes', 'make a lot of']"
"Tellingly, when not constrained by the debate format, these same politicians push the same narrative to garner support for bailing out student loans, all while the media provides the Democrats a free assist.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/15/student-debt-willingly-took-not-problem-solve/,federalist,student-debt,right,13.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Of all the pandering showcased during Democrats’ attempts to win back the presidency, wiping out student debt ranked at or near the top.
“I believe that education is the future for this country,” socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders barked during the first round of Democratic primary debates, explaining that’s why we must “eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke similarly. “I can tell you this,” the Minnesota senator demagogued, “if billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.”
There can be no serious discussion of this issue, however, in 60-second sound bites. So, beyond the soak-the-rich shtick that shades every Democratic economic debate point, the candidates resorted to two tactics: shock and sob stories.
The Shock Strategy
The size of student debt provides the jolt necessary to peddle their plans to the American populace. “I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself,” California Rep. Eric Swalwell bemoaned. “College affordability is personal for us,” South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared, noting that his household has “six-figure student debt.” So, sure, “I believe in reducing student debt,” Buttigieg announced.
Next came the sob stories. Those student loans are suffocating a generation, the candidates suggested. After all, “40 million of us who can’t start a family,” the diaper-changing daddy Swalwell contradictorily proclaimed, adding that they “Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.”
“We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on,” frontrunner Joe Biden agreed.
Tellingly, when not constrained by the debate format, these same politicians push the same narrative to garner support for bailing out student loans, all while the media provides the Democrats a free assist.
“With loans totaling more than $130,000,” Buttigieg’s household is “among the 43 million people in the United States who owe federal student loan debt,” the Associated Press reported last month, before highlighting the myriad plans to bail out student debt pushed by a cadre of presidential candidates. The AP then furthered the narrative by using statistics to shock the public into socialism:
The debtors are so numerous and the total debt so high—more than $1.447 trillion, according to federal statistics—that several of the Democratic candidates have made major policy proposals to address the crisis. Their ideas include wiping away debt, lowering interest rates, expanding programs that tie repayment terms to income and making college free or debt-free. Student loan debt is often discussed as an issue that mostly affects millennials, but it cuts across age groups. Federal statistics show that about 7.8 million people age 50 and older owe a combined $291.9 billion in student loans. People age 35 to 49, a group that covers older millennials such as Buttigieg as well as Generation X, owe $548.4 billion. That group includes more than 14 million people.
Sob Stories Reign Supreme
Then the sad tales continue the sales pitch for a government solution to student debt—a ploy that began well before the 2016 elections. Here’s one of myriad media examples.
“Shayna Pilnick, 28, would like to buy an apartment but can’t afford a mortgage. Jacqueline Mannino, 23, and her boyfriend, Benjamin Prowse, 26, want to get married. Jacob Childerson, 24, and his wife, Jennifer, 25, wish they could start a family, but they live with Jennifer’s parents,” is how USA Today opened its 2013 profile of millennials unable to obtain their dream life because they are “tethered” to “tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.”
There are many ways to counter these arguments, based on both economics and equity. But it’s hard to counter soundbites with sense, so instead, here are my inquiries for these politicians, the press, and all the students demanding relief from the burdens of their debt: Tell me your sob stories from age 12 on, not what you can’t do now, but what you couldn’t do then. Tell what you had to do then and through college to avoid what is now, to you, crushing student debt.
What time did you get up to deliver papers in junior high? How many hours a week did you work since 14 to save for college? How many toilets did you scrub? How many high school football games did you miss because you were working? What dream college did you forgo to avoid taking out student loans?
Which 8 a.m. class did you take so you could complete your major’s requirements and still work in the afternoon? Which bus line did you take to get to your job because you didn’t borrow to buy a car? What job did you work full-time while completing your MBA at night?
What did you do to afford college? What didn’t you do because of the cost of college? Were you getting tattoos and traveling your way through college? Were you pledging and partying? Did you go to your top-choice university? Maybe an out-of-state public university with higher tuition rates? Which spring break and study abroad destinations did you visit along the way?
Did you splurge on your fairytale wedding instead of paying down your student loans? What cars did you buy or lease? Where did you live? What electronics did you own? What clothing and other personal expenditures did you have? In short, show me the money and how you spent it!
None of my business? You’re right. Nor is your student debt my business or my problem.","['free', 'assist', 'Tellingly', 'push', 'bailing', 'out']"

Now that most of America has begun opening back up without the predicted spikes in coronavirus and Joe Biden has left his basement bunker, Americans are remembering that there’s an election going on. As normalcy quickly returns some places, so to has the battle for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
The Chinese virus has left a symbolic mark on the race. The facemask has emerged not just as an issue on the trail, but also as a signal as to one’s likely political leanings.
Donald Trump has taken heat for mostly refusing to mask up while performing his duties. This left the Biden camp with a choice to make when Joe woke up from political hibernation, and they went all in. Now it’s Joe getting into a car in a mask, Joe at a monument in a mask, Joe being interviewed in a mask, and in many cases he is socially distancing while wearing it, which the CDC does not advise.
New York Gov. Cuomo chimed in on the ubiquitous chinstraps saying that they have become, “Almost a point of cultural communication. Wearing a mask now is cool.” He joked about signing an executive order making masks cool.
He’s been making a lot of jokes recently as the Empire State crumbles, but this one had a germ of truth in it. The mask, especially in socially distanced situations is not about science anymore, it’s about signaling that the virus is too dangerous for our lives to return to normal. It sends the message that the pliant wearer will do as they are told and entitles them to heap scorn on those who won’t. Not surprisingly this often breaks down on party lines.
To be clear, almost nobody, including the president thinks that masks have no role to play as we reopen the economy. It makes sense to wear one in close space where you can’t be six feet apart, here in Brooklyn, an epicenter of the virus most people, myself included usually do that. But when walking down the street, or sitting on a park bench there is little reason to believe masks have much efficacy.
For our friends on the Left, Trump’s refusal to wear a mask is irresponsible toxic masculinity that is sending the wrong message and getting people killed, even though Dr. Deborah Brix has explained it’s not much of a risk. Biden, meanwhile, to their minds is leading by example by wearing his mask even when there is no good reason he should.
When you set aside the names of the politicians and parties, the divide that is revealed has most to do with how much control people want the government to have over their lives. Progressives are clear that their answer is a whole lot. From the Green New Deal to “Medicare for All,” banning guns, and now even to surveillance in the case of things like contact tracing, they invite a state that leaves individuals with far less choice and freedom.
One way to describe societies that decide to scrub away individual liberty is faceless; people are identical cogs without unique features. Here we move from the symbolic to the literal as people hide their faces from the world. The most important thing about these people is now that piece of fabric and the compliance it indicates. There will be no smiling.
Joe Biden and the Democrats are the party of the mask, the party of government power and intervention. For them the Chinese virus is an opportunity to seize, as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio put it, to create a new New Deal. Ultimately this election may now come down to a fight between Americans who want to return almost fully to life as it was, and those who seek a less free “new normal.”
This point might be made as forcefully as the Democrats doing a Zoom convention where Nancy Pelosi gives a speech in front of her fancy fridge and a GOP that trips the light fantastic in a rock’em, sock’em in-person live rally event. Should that occur, the contrast could not help but frame the contest. This is the election of the mask, and its just about time to choose your side.","['bunker', 'basement']"

“Over the long term, this is going to get solved, because at some point there’s going to be a President Rodriguez or there’s going to be a President Chen,” Obama told a Florida International University town hall audience, hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC.
“The country is a nation of immigrants, and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics are going to reflect who we are,” Obama continued, implying that neither native-born Americans or legal immigrants have moral standing to determine who enters and stays in the country.
Hispanic foreigners attending the town hall — Fox News Latino did not say whether they were legal or illegal aliens — told Obama they feared that federal Judge Andrew Hansen’s stay on Obama’s executive order will force them to return to their home countries. (Fox News Latino incorrectly identifies Hansen as a Texas judge.)
The five million illegal aliens covered by Obama’s executive order could also cash in on as much as $35,000 in taxpayer handouts. That’s a minimum $175 million cost to American taxpayers for the first year alone, not counting the massive strain the low-income, poorly-educated, gang-prone aliens with high rates of illegitimacy and untreated diseases will place on the country’s medical and social institutions.
Obama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.
Each year, four million Americans seeking jobs turn 18. In 2012, almost six million Americans graduated from college, saddled with an average $27,000 in student loan debt — $8,000 less than the handouts available for illegals presently in the country.

Imagine if you got your news only from the New York Times, and how bigoted that would make you against non-liberals.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/04/3-ways-media-hacks-are-dangerously-politicizing-vaccines/,federalist,vaccines,right,13.0,3.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Last year the Centers for Disease Control reported 644 domestic cases of measles, a respiratory disease spread through the air. Already in January of this year there are 102 people in 14 states who have it, most of this related to being at Disneyland in mid-December. That’s the main reason why California has 92 of those 102 confirmed cases. The disease was eliminated in the United States by 2000 but can be brought back and spread via international travelers. All states have rules requiring a measles vaccine for children in public school but some exemptions are allowed. The exemptions are disconcerting to some.
We see stories such as this one from September in The Atlantic: “Wealthy L.A. Schools’ Vaccination Rates Are as Low as South Sudan’s: Hollywood parents say not vaccinating makes ‘instinctive’ sense.” The full story from The Hollywood Reporter is fascinating. More recently we saw this from a local CBS affiliate: “Berkeley’s Measles Ultimatum: 21-Day Quarantine For Unvaccinated Kids If Outbreak Spreads.” BuzzFeed notes that half of the children that attend some Marin County schools north of San Francisco are not vaccinated. The Washington Post notes that the California communities where anti-vaccinators cluster are also the most liberal, voting overwhelmingly for President Obama.
For some reason, many in the media (as well as other liberal commentators) decided to try to make this story about a measles outbreak in California and a concern about vaccination rates in Hollywood, Marin County and Berkeley into an existential problem for — stay with me here because it makes zero sense if you’re not a hack — the Republican Party and conservatives. It’s an odd, perhaps even desperate and clownish, choice. But such is what our political media does these days. See, for example, the completely manufactured and orchestrated “War on Women.”
Here are three obvious but important ways the media demonstrated a disgusting partisan slant instead of good journalism.
1. It is indefensible to spin this as a problem for Republicans.
What got liberals in the media going this week was a statement made by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican:
“Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated, and we think that it’s an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health,” the likely 2016 presidential candidate said while in Cambridge, England. The Republican also noted: “I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.”
Not three days earlier, we had this nearly identical statement from the White House, currently occupied by a Democrat. Nota bene: the President is actually the highest office in the land, even higher than the governor of New Jersey:
""Well, the President certainly believes that these kinds of decisions are decisions that should be made by parents, because ultimately when we’re talking about vaccinations, we’re typically talking about vaccinations that are given to children. But the science on this, as our public health professionals I’m sure would be happy to tell you, the science on this is really clear.""
Both President Obama and Gov. Christie are, in fact, articulating what is state policy in all 50 states. At least to some degree. All 50 states require vaccination and all 50 allow parents to opt-out for medical reasons. All but two allow opt-outs for religious or other reasons. The two that allow no non-medical opt-outs? The super-liberal Democratic states of … oh dear, this doesn’t fit the narrative at all, does it … Mississippi and West Virginia.
Now, outfits such as Mother Jones, Rolling Stone and Salon have all published anti-vaccination pieces in the past decade. The latter two, in fact, published a piece by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. You can probably guess a little something about his political affiliation. But that doesn’t mean that concerns about vaccination are exclusively on the left.
A late January survey by YouGov asked “Do you think early childhood vaccinations can cause autism?” The percentage who responded “definitely” or “probably”: 13% of Democrats, 15% of Independents and 11% of Republicans. It also asked, “When it comes to childhood diseases, like measles, mumps, and whooping cough, should all children be required to get vaccinations or should parents be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children?” More on the inadequacies of this question later, but 70% of Democrats, 48% of Independents and 57% of Republicans said it should be required. The survey asked “Have you received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations?” Republicans were most likely to say yes, at 78%. Democrats and Independents were tied at 69%. Republicans were also most likely to say that they had vaccinated their children, with 88% saying they had, compared to 82% of Democrats with children and 79% of Independents. Finally, Republicans were also more informed about the measles outbreak, with 84% reporting they knew about it compared to 66% of Democrats and Independents. To put it mildly, this is not an issue on which you see a clear partisan divide, particularly not in one particular direction.
But many in our political media — not known for being deep thinkers but known for loving to play gotcha, no matter how little it brings to the discussion — decided that this issue of Berkeley, Marin County and Hollywood parents needed to be jujitsued into a problem for the GOP.
A perfect example comes from Jeremy W. Peters of the New York Times:
The politics of medicine, morality and free will collide as GOP debates itself again over established science: http://t.co/Ofd6v1fTzH
Jeremy W. Peters (@jwpetersNYT) February 3, 2015
Here’s some text from his story. Again, this is the New York Times and not Daily Kos diaries:
Oh for crying out loud. The desperation. Imagine if you got your news only from the New York Times, and how bigoted that would make you against non-liberals.
Anyway, Peters and other groupthinkers went around writing stories about how Republicans have some huge vaccine problem, facts be cast aside. And they went out of their way to ask GOP politicians questions about whether they agreed with this largely universal vaccination approach. But then they framed such agreement in the most nefarious of terms. This was only practiced on GOP politicians, mind you. Not Democrats.
Fun fact about Jeremy W. Peters. I tweeted:
New rule: 100% of journalists must ask 100% of Democrats when science says life begins before uttering the word “vaccine” even one more time
Mollie (@MZHemingway) February 3, 2015
A reader reminded me of a curious historical footnote. A few years ago John McCormack, a reporter for the Weekly Standard, asked Nancy Pelosi, “What is the moral difference between what Dr. Gosnell did to a baby born alive at 23 weeks and aborting her moments before birth?” Now, political journalists know that only pro-life candidates should be on the receiving end of difficult abortion questions. So it’s funny to note what the transcript of this reporter scrum says next (spoiler: Pelosi doesn’t answer the question and no other reporter presses it):
PELOSI: You're probably enjoying that question a lot, I can see you savoring it. [Laughter in press corps] Let me just tell you this.
Who was the reporter in question? It was Peters. Peters bust a gut laughing. Isn’t that so weird? That the same reporter who is making up crap about vaccines being a political problem for Republicans would help out Nancy Pelosi when a single reporter asks her a tough question about her radical abortion stance? That is so weird!
But, yeah, good work each and every one of you reporters who made this fake story something to waste time on this week. You’re all hacks.
2. Hypocrisy in pandemic fear
Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, sore throat and all-over body rash. According to the Washington Post:
Fatalities are rare in the United States, but one or two of every 1,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease, according to Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. More common complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and deafness. Pregnant women who get the measles may give birth prematurely or deliver low-birth-weight babies.
Symptoms of Ebola include, according to the CDC:
Fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal (stomach) pain, unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or bruising).
The fatality rate for Ebola cases from last year is 71%, according to the CDC.
No one wants to get measles, a disease we know a fair bit about and which many Americans of a certain age contracted as children. But it doesn’t even come close to the scare of getting Ebola and having it liquify your organs.
Remember how the media treated Americans who were a bit freaked out about the spread of Ebola? I do. See “Media Should Stop Lecturing Americans About Their Ebola Concerns” and “Media’s ‘Panic Panic’ Is Reaching New Annoying Levels With Quarantines.” The joke of a site PolitiFact even made concerns about Ebola it’s “Lie of the Year.”
You may remember that NBC journalist Nancy Snyderman broke her Ebola quarantine, to the outrage of her neighbors. You will never believe what she tweeted this week:
When free will trumps public health we put our nation's most vulnerable at risk. That doesn't seem very American to me. Vaccinate #measles
Dr. Nancy Snyderman (@DrNancyNBCNEWS) February 3, 2015
Yes, the same woman who broke her Ebola quarantine wrote that tweet.
On that note, remember the media outrage when certain governors took the Ebola threat more seriously than some in the media? It was crazy. Read this link for some of the details, but a nurse who was quarantined by Chris Christie said her human rights had been violated. Various reporters were absolutely outraged that readers didn’t seem to care about this.
But now that you have certain politicians saying it’s important to balance public health programs with concerns about liberty, the media are in full-on panic mode, writing as many stories they can about how Sen. Rand Paul is the world’s greatest threat. Here, for example is how one journalist responded to a tweet by Rand Paul (since deleted and language warning).
Talk about hysteria.
Listen, I’m generally on the side of people who fear bad diseases, whether they’re the liquifying organs kind or the bad rash on your body kind, and whether there’s a widespread vaccine in use against it or not. But could we get some consistency here? A standard other than the “be on the side that hurts Republicans” standard the media are experts in?
3. Defining the terms
NPR had an interesting story four years ago about vaccination and public health threats. Here’s a portion of the discussion with Michael Willrich, author of “Pox: An American History.”
From the very start of the organized vaccination campaign against smallpox, there was public resistance, says Willrich. The battle between the government and the vocal anti-vaccinators came to a head in a landmark 1902 Supreme Court decision, where the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state to order a vaccination for its population during an epidemic to protect the people from a devastating disease. ""But at the same time, the Court recognized certain limitations on that power — that this power of health policing was no absolute and was not total and there was a sphere of individual liberty that needed to be recognized,"" says Willrich. ""Measures like this needed to be reasonable and someone who could make a legitimate claim that a vaccine posed a particular risk to them because of their family history or medical history [would not have to be vaccinated.]"" In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stipulated that a state couldn't forcibly vaccinate its population. ""[They said,] 'Of course, it would be unconstitutional and go beyond the pale for health officials to forcibly vaccinate anyone because that's not within their power,'"" says Willrich. ""And I think that's really a shoutout to the Boston health authorities who were employing forcible vaccination all the time in the poorest neighborhoods in the city.""
Would these court decisions be called “anti-vaxxer,” the media adjective du jour? Consider this tweet from BuzzFeed’s Adam Serwer:

Leaving aside the idea that 26% to 30% of a group could be described as fringe, what we see is a conflation of opposition to vaccines with opposition to forced government vaccination. Here might be another example.
What does “mandatory” vaccination mean? Does it mean something that allows that the “power of health policing is not absolute” as the Courts might say? Or does it mean we fine and jail parents who choose not to vaccinate their children? Does it mean we take children away from parents who don’t vaccinate? Or does it mean we don’t allow non-vaccinated children in public schools?
Does it matter why parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children? Is it because they have moral objections to using vaccines developed from aborted babies? Is it because their child has medical problems that would be compounded by a vaccine injection? Is it because they’re philosophically opposed to medicine? Is it because they believe discredited studies about a link between autism and vaccines? What lines should be drawn?
I get that the media really want to do some bullcrap horse-race point-scoring partisan sniping right now. But these are actually important questions. And “gotcha” reporting may get you butt-slapped by your fellow reporters at the bar, but it’s actually really dangerous.
Vaccinations are too important to be sucked into a politicized debate and the media should be ashamed for trying so hard to make it so. Vaccines are one of the most agreed-upon topics regardless of political leaning. We already mandate vaccinations in 50 states. Journalistic discussion of whether the exemptions to these mandates are too broad or too narrow is legitimate, even if media panic seems a bit overwrought right now. There is no way that debate goes well if it becomes the media’s next “War on Women” type exercise of water carrying for Democrats.","['crying', 'out', 'loud', 'desperation', 'bigoted']"
"USA Today Sports published a broadside against youth tackle football, claiming that the sport is just too dangerous for children.",https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/03/04/usa-today-makes-the-case-for-banning-youth-tackle-football/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,14.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"USA Today Sports published a broadside against youth tackle football, claiming that the sport is just too dangerous for children.
Calling its proposal “a sensible change,” writer Joe Schad calls for an end to tackle football for everyone under 14 years of age in a March 4 article.
The paper imagines that the ban would not affect football overall.
“With this shift,” Schad writes, “kids would grow up playing flag football before transitioning to tackle football in high school — just like youth baseball players start with T-ball before learning to hit pitches from a machine, a coach and, eventually, live pitchers.”
USA Today Sports cited the claims by tackle ban supporter Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, and former NFL player.
“The kids don’t lose anything in this situation,” Nowinski said. “There’s no safety issue that’s known. There’s no football development issue that’s known — no child’s being recruited off their fifth-grade film. So you end up with healthier children, still playing football — just for fewer seasons of tackle.”
Nowinski has been selling the idea of replacing tackle football with flag football in an effort to put an end to brain trauma among kids in sports.
The paper goes on to deny claims that waiting until high school to expose kids to tackle football opens them to more injuries. Such a worry, the paper says, is “fear-mongering.”
Other sports have taken notice of CTE worries, USA Today Sports reports:
Most professional sports organizations have reacted to this research over the past decade by changing how they operate. US Soccer now bans heading before the age of 10. USA Hockey eliminated checking before 13. US Lacrosse now penalizes any contact to the head. “Football’s on an island,” Nowinski, a former Harvard football player, said. “It’s the only sport now where children as young as 5 … are getting hit in the head hundreds of times.”
USA Today Sports concludes urging state legislatures to take up the cause of banning youth tackle football.
But the move is already afoot. Several states, including New York, California, Maryland, Illinois, and Massachusetts, among others, have begun looking into the idea of banning youth football. Thus far, these states have made proposals, but no laws have yet been implemented.

Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.","['bailed', 'unsuspecting']"

Kennedy Jr., reports Insider.com.
For about five years, between 2006 and 2011, HuffPo was a hotbed bed of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorizing. I remember this well because back in those days, when I ran this site’s Big Hollywood vertical, our contributors regularly responded to this madness.
The whole anti-vaxx (as it became known) thing was nuts, a way for fading celebrities to pretend to be the vanguard of a Great Cause that Saved The Children from a sinister government conspiracy. The destructive narcissism on display as they held themselves up as America’s brave truth-tellers was as nauseating as watching them virtue-signal their way into the spotlight.
Bill Maher, Jessica Biel, Charlie Sheen, Kirstie Alley, Selma Blair, Rob Schneider, Erin Brockovich, Juliette Lewis, and, before he became president, even Donald Trump, all helped to spread this nonsense.
By 2015, Republicans like Chris Christie and Rand Paul were flirting with it.
The idea behind the conspiracy is that these miracle vaccines — and they are medical miracles — can cause autism, when there is no data to back that up.
Nevertheless, HuffPo, with its open forum that allowed anyone to publish pretty much anything, especially if that person’s celebrity made founder Arianna Huffington look connected and plugged in, took what was a harmless groups of celebutard quacks and weaponized them into the mainstream. Suddenly the lunacy of not having your child immunized became an act of being down with Playboy Playmate Jenny McCarthy’s struggle.
And now, as was expected, America is dealing with a serious measles outbreak.
Did you know that 19 years ago we completely eradicated measles in this country?
With the return of this disease, what had been working just fine — a sensible opt-out policy that still kept vaccination rates high enough to protect what is known as herd immunity — is now, by necessity, becoming yet another coercive government program.
For example, earlier this month, New York repealed its religious exemptions for vaccinations.
You see, once upon a time, before the Huffington Post decided to treat Jim Carrey like a Big Thinker, it was not necessary to force everyone to get immunized. If the immunization rate is somewhere around 90 percent, that’s good enough, and this ten percent leeway (that’s a ballpark figure) allowed for parents to opt-out based on religious, philosophical, or medical concerns.
These opt-out opportunities, which varied state-by-state, were able to hit the perfect American sweet spot — that spot between public safety and the individual conscience.
But after a bunch of cynical preeners jumped on the bandwagon, that sweet spot is probably going to have to close even more. Even California has had to clamp down.
Also unfortunate is the fact that a major left-wing publication has now been shamed into memory-holing dozens of opinion pieces. But that is only the fault of Arianna Huffington and the Huffington Post, who could have and should have handled this debate more responsibly at the time. No one wants any debate shamed out of existence, but here we are…
Back in 2015, in a piece critical of Christie and Paul, I warned: “If you want the government to truly mandate vaccinations, keep feeding these anti-vaxx conspiracies. Once the anti-vaxx movement grows in size to where immunization rates drop to dangerous levels, the government will definitely step in.”

Tuesday's special elections show we should hold off on the ""Blue Wave"" and ""Trump can't win"" narratives.
It was just two days ago that ABC News’ election forecaster FiveThirtyEight suggested “Two Special Elections On Tuesday Could Hint At Another Blue Wave In 2020.”
The case made by Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich was simple: Supposedly Americans strongly prefer Biden and Democrats over Trump and Republicans, and they are particularly upset with Trump and other Republicans’ attempts to reopen the country as the global Coronavirus pandemic rages.
“On Tuesday, we’ll get a taste of whether Democrats’ electoral advantage on paper will hold up in practice, as California and Wisconsin hold special elections for two vacant congressional seats. The main event is in the California 25th Congressional District, a bellwether seat in the north Los Angeles suburbs, where both parties see a chance to add to their ranks in the House. But if Democrats are also competitive in the quickly reddening, rural Wisconsin 7th Congressional District, it could signal another blue wave in the fall,” they argued.
The contest in California’s 25th Congressional District was an open battle for a seat vacated by Katie Hill after the married representative got in trouble with Democratic leadership for intimate relations with some of her staff members. The House had just passed rules forbidding such relationships. She won her seat by nine points in 2018 in a district Hillary Clinton won by seven points. Wisconsin’s blue collar-heavy 7th Congressional District went for Obama by eight points in 2008, but now favors Republicans such as Trump. Trump won the district by some 20 points in 2016, when Republican Sean Duffy won re-election with 62 percent of the vote. Even as a very popular incumbent, Duffy’s support ticked down to 60 percent in 2018. The FiveThirtyEight fellas reminded readers that Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin lost the district by five points in 2018, and Democrat-favored Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice-elect Jill Karofsky lost it by 6 points last month. Suspecting a Republican victory might be eked out, they said to pay special attention to margins.
“Still, pay attention to the final margin, both here and in California. When a party consistently overperforms its usual partisan baseline in special elections, it bodes well for that party in the general election as well. So even a narrow loss by [Democrat Tricia] Zunker, if paired with a comfortable [Democrat Christy] Smith win, would add to the evidence that another Democratic wave is building.”
Well, the results are in and Republicans won both seats. And not by small margins. In Wisconsin, Republican Tom Tiffany beat Zunker by 14.4 points.
In California, with some precincts still reporting, Mike Garcia is currently winning his election by 12 points. According to Dave Wasserman, it’s the first time the GOP has picked up a seat in the state since 1998.
As Alex Berenson, a skeptic of the government-mandated economic shutdown, asked, “But Democrats are the party of lockdowns, and voters love lockdowns, amirite?”
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, similarly tweeted:
How do we jibe these results with the pre-election media spin? There are a few factors to look at. The most obvious one is that members of the Resistance– whether official Democrat Party leaders or the unofficial ones who dominate legacy media — are hoping that Trump’s handling of the global pandemic can be spun into a Trump-specific “Katrina” debacle. They’ve been trying to convince sufficient voters of Trump’s failure for many years, but have thus far been unable to do so.
The media spin against Trump’s handling of the global pandemic is not data-driven or reality-based so much as emotive. The media could be harshly critical of Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose decisions regarding public transportation and nursing homes wreaked tragic results in his state. Instead, they have uniformly praised him. After criticizing Trump for overreacting to the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, by enacting a travel ban, they then said he didn’t do enough. Their latest spin is that he is prioritizing the private sector too much by encouraging a reopening of the economy. Whatever the ever-changing charge, the topline argument remains the same. Trump’s handling is so poor, they say, that many Republicans will suffer in November.
What’s weird about this narrative is that the underlying data do not support it. Trump’s approval during this unrelenting media assault has not gone up, but neither has it gone down. And he remains more popular than Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The promised Blue Wave special election victories turned instead into Republican victories.
Privately, all this narrative spin in the face of facts might relate to what many people know but are worried about admitting publicly. Democrats have a lot going for them headed into November — legacy media support being a huge structural advantage worth countless dollars and voters — but they’re holding a weak hand with their nominee Biden and know that they’re in trouble. Since Trump won, Democratic strategists and other anti-Trump activists have known that the key to preventing a Trump re-election is to peel off enough Republican and independent voters to hand a Democrat a victory.
The Russia collusion hoax didn’t do it, not even with all the resources and support given to the Democrats working in the Robert Mueller Special Counsel probe. The Ukraine impeachment effort was so silly and such a waste of valuable time that the only Republican in the country to fall for it was the emotionally invested NeverTrump senator Sen. Mitt Romney, R-UT. For years, Democratic strategists inside and outside the media have worried that a strong economy would help Trump win re-election. The global pandemic may harm that advantage, they may have reasonably surmised.
The media and others may be hysterical right now, though, because even at the pinnacle of their heightened anti-Trump offensive, polls show him doing fine.
Take a CNN poll that just came out, supposedly showing Biden beating Trump by five points. It is being spun, of course, as excellent news for Biden. But Biden was supposedly trouncing Trump by as much as 11 points in recent months, according to the same CNN polling. Since CNN last polled, it and other media outlets have done nothing but run pieces claiming Trump is a lunatic forcing innocent Americans to ingest bleach. And yet his standing improves? Even worse for Democrats, the CNN poll shows Trump doing well in key battle ground states.
Surely in the midst of this round-the-clock negative coverage of Trump, pollsters should be able to find double digit leads like the ones they put forth last year. In late October, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll had Biden up 9, ABC News/Washington Post had him up by 17, and Fox News claimed he would beat Trump by 12 points. Why isn’t Biden doing better than that in the midst of the media’s uniform criticism of his opponent?
Democrats may be in trouble. Their polls show Biden slipping, he hasn’t even begun to experience the rigors of a legitimate campaign, and Democrats can’t easily replace Biden so long as Bernie Sanders and his supporters continue to exist. And all while even CNN admits that Trump’s 49 percent job approval is “matching the highest it’s ever been” and betting markets are favoring Trump so much that Axios was recently forced to admit it.
None of this is to say that there won’t be a Blue Wave on election day or that Biden won’t win. We’ll have a poll on election day, just like we had polls yesterday in California and Wisconsin. We’ll see what happens. What we do know is that if the media were telling an even remotely accurate story about the political situation thus far, there is no way those two Republicans would have won. So let’s hold off on the “Blue Wave” and “Trump can’t win” narratives.
And as for the talking point that Tuesday’s results would be a sign of what’s to come for Democrats, Republicans may hope so.",['Supposedly']

The historic church was boarded up after rioters set fires there the day before, in an act which made even many on the Left incredulous.
The president’s likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.”
Some religious leaders found it “baffling and reprehensible” that the St. John Paul II National Shrine would allow the president to visit with First Lady Melania Trump, who is Catholic.
Actually, the opposition to the President’s actions is baffling. Every religious leader should be cheering the president’s expression of faith and commitment to religious liberty.
Before the nation became engulfed in violence sparked in part by the death of George Floyd and in large measure by unrelated agendas of violent agitators, the president had planned to sign an executive order on international religious freedom at the John Paul II Center.
“This was fitting,” according to a statement on the Shrine’s Twitter page, “given John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate.”
President Trump, too, is committed to preserving religious liberty in our nation and in the world but that one unassailable fact is conveniently overlooked by his critics.
Trump has been a tireless advocate for religious freedom during his presidency, beginning with an executive order close to my heart that he signed during a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2017, just over three months into his term. My colleague Alveda King, who leads our Civil Rights for the Unborn outreach, was there to represent Priests for Life.
That order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954. President Trump’s Department of Justice backed that up with a memo to the Internal Revenue Service in 2018, ordering agents not to enforce the Johnson Amendment.
The order also took the side of Priests for Life against the Obama mandate that every employer must provide abortifacient drugs and devices to their employees. Priests for Life was among dozens of petitioners who challenged that Obama mandate all the way up to the Supreme Court. In 2018, HHS finalized a rule that protected faith-based organizations from that mandate.
Also in 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the formation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in the HHS Office for Civil Rights. President Trump created the office to protect the conscience rights of health-care workers whose religious beliefs do not allow them to take part in abortion or assisted suicide.
In 2019, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs allowed Bibles on their premises once again. Also that year, the president lifted a ban on providing federal funds to faith-based black colleges and universities.
The president has also endorsed Bible literacy in public schools, defended the rights of students to pray, and defended faith-based adoption agencies that have been under attack for declining to place children in same-sex households.
He has looked at every place in our society where religious liberty is threatened, and taken steps to protect it. I have lost track of the number of special actions President Trump’s Administration has taken to make the federal government and public life in general more hospitable to citizens and organizations of Faith.
It is absolutely refreshing and inspiring.
He continued those efforts this week.
On Tuesday, as his visit to a Catholic shrine was being decried in the media, President Trump signed an order that would prioritize religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy.
This is a president committed to preserving and protecting the religious liberty every American is guaranteed under the First Amendment, and that everyone in the world is guaranteed by their human dignity.
Did President Trump have the right to hold a Bible aloft in front of a church? You bet he did.
The Democrats, and their media mouthpieces, have gone too far in criticizing the president over what they called a stage-managed photo op. Yet this kind of criticism is more and more characteristic of their party and its leaders.
In 2015, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton infamously said that “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed” (emphasis mine). These Democrats want to change people’s religious beliefs, and they think they have to right to do that.
In his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O’Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else!
Biden says he’s a Catholic, goes to Mass on Sunday, and believes that mothers should be able to have their children killed up until their due dates and that U.S. taxpayers should pay for it! During his lackluster campaign, Biden has said “We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.”
On this point he is absolutely right. And winning that battle demands keeping these morally misguided Democrats out of office.

Mann writes that he took his family “to see the Great Barrier Reef – one of the great wonders of this planet – while we still can.”
“Subject to the twin assaults of warming-caused bleaching and ocean acidification, it will be gone in a matter of decades in the absence of a dramatic reduction in global carbon emissions,” Mann prophesies.
The Blue Mountains, as well, “another of Australia’s natural wonders,” Mann laments, “is now threatened by climate change.”
“I witnessed this firsthand,” he states.
Mann does not explain how it was possible for him to witness climate change “first hand,” which would be difficult to do, since by definition climate change — unlike weather — takes place over long periods of time.
Instead of “vast expanses of rainforest framed by distant blue-tinged mountain ranges,” Mann looked out into “smoke-filled valleys, with only the faintest ghosts of distant ridges and peaks in the background.”
“The locals, whom I found to be friendly and outgoing, would volunteer that they have never seen anything like this before. Some even uttered the words ‘climate change’ without any prompting,” Mann declares, as apparent proof that he was witnessing climate change “first hand.”
Mann goes on to make proclamations that only a publication as ideologically compromised as the Guardian would think to publish.
“The brown skies I observed in the Blue Mountains this week are a product of human-caused climate change,” Mann states.
“The warming of our planet – and the changes in climate associated with it – are due to the fossil fuels we’re burning: oil, whether at midnight or any other hour of the day, natural gas, and the biggest culprit of all, coal,” he declares.
“When we mine for coal, like the controversial planned Adani coalmine, which would more than double Australia’s coal-based carbon emissions, we are literally mining away at our blue skies,” Mann says. (In his defense, he is using “literally” here to mean “figuratively” or “not literally.”)
Australians “need only wake up in the morning, turn on the television, read the newspaper or look out the window to see what is increasingly obvious to many – for Australia, dangerous climate change is already here,” Mann pronounces.
“Australia is experiencing a climate emergency. It is literally burning,” he says, before suggesting that it is time to vote in woke leaders who embrace the dogmas of the climate crisis.
“Australians must vote out fossil-fuelled politicians who have chosen to be part of the problem and vote in climate champions who are willing to solve it,” he states.
Mann may have missed the 2018 World Air Quality Report, published by IQAIR, which ranks the world’s nations by the cleanliness of their air, according to estimated average PM2.5 concentration (μg/m³).
Had he read the report, he would have found a curious fact: by and large, the cleanest air is found in first-world nations that have benefited from the cheap, available energy that he deplores. The countries with the most polluted air are mostly those that still have to benefit from this energy.
Though it is not the only factor (Kuwait, for example, is a notable exception), there is a remarkable correlation between air cleanliness and economic development, as well as between development and the availability of cheap energy.

It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/27/stop-blaming-pro-lifers-for-the-lefts-racism/?utm_source=The+Federalist+List&utm_campaign=22f3c24165-RSS_The_Federalist_Daily_Updates_w_Transom&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cfcb868ceb-22f3c24165-83771301,federalist,abortion,right,15.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Thanks to abortion, America is whiter than it would be if all those babies were allowed to live. If pro-lifers had their way, the United States would be blacker and browner than it is today.
Another day, another pro-lifer smeared as a racist. In August, it was Catholic author J.D. Vance, whom a Washington Post writer tried to tar with the r-word, only to fall flat when it was revealed that she misrepresented what Vance said and failed to note that his wife and son are Indian American. This time around, it is Episcopalian Tucker Carlson, accused by Farhad Manjoo in Sunday’s New York Times of “advancing ethnonationalist populism” and worse.
Like some falsehoods, this latest has a kernel of truth: The Fox News host is a “populist.” But the magical-thinking leap from populism to racism, which is now de rigueur in such hit pieces, crashes and burns. Manjoo’s charge is drawn mostly from a staffer at uber-woke Media Matters, whose job, apparently, is to watch Fox News and follow social media. White nationalists, reports Manjoo ominously, quoting the Media Matters researcher, “look at [Tucker] as a thought leader and an influential thinker.”
So? Whatever else you make of him, that’s what Carlson is. Anyone within reach of a television could say the same, from Antifa members to fans of “Stranger Things.” If we’re really going to talk about racism, let’s ask a more interesting question than any in the New York Times piece: Who, exactly, thinks that adding more brown and black people to the world is a good thing — and who doesn’t?
‘Family Planning’ Means Reducing Minorities
Whether it means to or not, team left amounts to keeping the world a whiter place. Recall Bernie Sanders’ recent open fretting about “overpopulation” and the need for more birth control in the “poor countries.” On any short list of those nations — say, the poorest 20 — almost all lie in Africa. To well-off, aging, lefty Westerners, more young Africans amounts to a problem.
On the global, liberal left, that same preoccupation with Africans and their fertility is endemic. In July 2017, childless French President Emmanuel Macron worried at an appearance in Germany over the “civilizational” challenges facing Africa, singling out the fact that women in some countries still have “seven or eight children.” Elsewhere that same summer, Canada’s minister of international development, Marie-Claude Bibeau, called abortion “a tool to end poverty.” En route to a “family planning” meeting in Rwanda, she was not speaking of Canadians.
The forward-looking Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is another powerful institution, the resources of which, whatever the intentions behind them, will have the effect of bringing fewer African babies into the world. Which, exactly, are the families that apparently need to be “planned” — a euphemism for “reduced,” since “family planning” never includes family expansion? Check the faces on the relevant section of the website. They do not resemble Icelanders or Finns.
It isn’t only the prospect of more Africans that summons anxiety in some places. In 2009, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a slip akin to Macron’s, when she said in an interview with New York Times Magazine that “at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” She didn’t mean descendants of those who sailed on the Mayflower.
Pro-Lifers Would Bless the World with Brown Babies
So returning to our original question: Who, exactly, doesn’t think bringing more brown and black humans into the world is a problem?
One contender is the Catholic Church. Pope Francis just concluded a tour of several countries on the continent, tacitly affirming what everyone who can count already knows: The future of Christianity lies in Africa. It’s in tradition-minded Africa that Christianity has grown explosively during these last decades. African priests and ministers are now routinely being exported to the United States, to re-evangelize the descendants of the people who first evangelized them.
The pro-life movement isn’t for keeping down the numbers of brown and black people, either. In such circles — and only in such circles — the fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned. The pro-life Lozier Institute, among others, keeps steady track of disparities such as these: “In 2016, as in previous years, more African American babies were aborted than were born alive in New York City.” Outside the pro-life movement, this racial disparity garners not a peep, including from people who accuse others of promoting “whiteness.”
Say what you like about pro-lifers, including Carlson, but they don’t think whitening up the country is a good thing. That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know. It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness.
Here’s an irony: Thanks to Roe, America is a whiter place than it would otherwise have become. If pro-lifers had had their way, on the other hand, America would be considerably blacker and browner than it is today. So do the thought experiment: Which result might a real supremacist like more?","['disingenuousness', 'pro-lifers']"
"Last year, XFL Commissioner Oliver Luck noted that the XFL reached out to Kaepernick, but the former NFL player demanded absurdly high $20 million a season salary.",https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/02/10/colin-kaepernick-demanded-absurdly-high-salary-to-play-in-the-xfl/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,15.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"With the nation’s newest pro football league fairly off the ground, some are wondering why Colin Kaepernick isn’t playing for the new XFL. The answer, is typically Kaepernickian.
So, why isn’t Kaepernick gearing up for the XFL? It appears his salary demands priced him right out of the market from the word “go.”
From reports last year, the XFL actually reached out to Kaepernick to see if he might be interested in playing for the new league.
Last year, XFL Commissioner Oliver Luck noted that the XFL reached out to Kaepernick, but the former NFL player asked for an out sized $20 million a season salary. And in a league whose top pay is only $500,000 a season, that is just a touch higher than the league can float. As he has in so many other cases, Colin Kaepernick torpedoed his own chances.
“I think his salary demands are way out of our ballpark,” Luck said when asked about the possibility of Kaepernick joining the league. “He was never really a viable option.”
.@OliverLuckXFL on Colin Kaepernick in the XFL – I have no idea weather Colin is in shape or not. weather he wants to play. We are a league that has salary restrictions and obviously, at least based on what people have said, that might play a role in his desire to play. — The Ken Carman Show w/ Anthony Lima (@KenCarmanShow) April 17, 2019
Still, as Sporting News noted, even if Kaepernick’s salary demands were in line with what the XFL could offer, there is the question of Kaepernick’s anti-American protests.
One of the very first things XFL Owner/CEO Vince McMahon did when he began planning the resurgence of the XFL was to announce that he would tolerate no protests in his new football league.
“People don’t want social and political issues coming into play when they are trying to be entertained,” McMahon told ESPN in 2017. “We want someone who wants to take a knee to do their version of that on their personal time.”
McMahon followed that up by saying he felt it would be “appropriate” for the league to make a rule requiring players to stand for the anthem.
“It’s a time-honored tradition to stand and appreciate the national anthem with any sport. Here in America — for that matter, in any country…so I think it’d be appropriate to do that,” he said.
McMahon’s concept may have been challenged by including Kaepernick.

This argument that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/woman-who-killed-baby-over-maternity-leave-proves-welfare-wont-fix-abortion/?fbclid=IwAR2SBE3O9KtpsqJvMCIeSlk4Zeqn3oexJevVoXUhDpKszW_VHrTEMBiewaw,federalist,abortion,right,15.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”
This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.
This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.
The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.
Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.
The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”
This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.
This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.
I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.
Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.
In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.
Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.
Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.
It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.","['dishonest', 'taunt']"
"Curiously, both Kelly and Yen seem unaware of the influx of undocumented immigrants pouring into this country daily from countries with very low vaccination rates...",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/27/vaccine-mandates-put-vulnerable-peoples-health-lives-risk/,federalist,vaccines,right,15.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Several years ago, I began to recognize treadmills. Not the ones at the gym—I’m talking about lifestyle treadmills: the paths we take in life based upon well-established social and institutional norms. These are the paths we rarely question because, well, “everyone does it.”
We stepped off the public education treadmill in 2011, when we began homeschooling. We exited the convenience treadmill a few years later when we moved from an established neighborhood to a farm in a small town 25 miles away. And that move got us off our next treadmill.
Once we lived miles from our regular physicians and weren’t required to be “current” on vaccinations, we simply didn’t make doctors’ appointments. Other than a rotten appendix, none of us have been sick enough in the five years since our move to warrant a visit, but I digress.
Health Care Has Become a Treadmill
I was born in 1962, just seven years after Jonas Salk’s discovery became available for public use—a time which could be referred to as the “decade of vaccines.”
My parents told stories of swimming pool hysteria, iron lungs, and classmates who suffered the effects of polio. Measles was killing children polio wasn’t, rubella was causing miscarriages and birth defects, and the mumps vaccine had just been improved. My sister and I were vaccinated for them all individually before the combined MMR vaccine came to market in the 1970s, and my parents were very grateful for that opportunity.
The peace of mind brought by vaccine science and antibiotics elevated the practice of medicine. If you got sick, you went to the doctor. You received some kind of pill you took until you felt better, no matter how many were left in the bottle (see antibiotic resistance).
Homeopathic remedies began to look like more like witchcraft, compared with the success and ease of modern medicine. It was easier to take prescription medications than to ride out their inconveniences or research other methods of treatment.
But today, the pendulum is swinging back. With Obamacare and the associated gargantuan rise in health care costs, many citizens are being forced to pay attention to their personal health, contributing to a rise in alternative medicine. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, nearly 40 percent of the US adult population used some kind of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in 2008, including diet-based therapies, massage or acupuncture, and/or natural products and supplements such as herbs and essential oils.
Is it unbelievable then, that parents would begin to question the safety, efficacy and necessity of their child’s vaccinations as well?
Why Would Anyone Question Vaccines?
When my biological kids were born (and after our adopted children became American citizens and Oklahoma residents), their pediatrician gave them the standard CDC vaccination protocol corresponding to their year of birth (2002–2004). Though the large number of syringes on the nurse’s tray being emptied into chunky little thighs and arms made me nervous—I knew of the possibility for vaccine injury—I never really questioned the process. I had carefully interviewed the physician who would be their pediatrician. I believed I had done my due diligence.
Every year, the kids had their well-baby visits and were given booster vaccinations as necessary.
Once school aged, in order to be enrolled in their zip-code-assigned public school, state law required them to be current on their vaccination schedule. This included vaccines for chicken pox (Varicella), Hepatitis A and B.
Although I was conditioned to accept the Polio, MMR, and DPT vaccines, these additions had always frustrated me. From 1997 to 1999, I was employed as an epidemiologist with the Oklahoma State Department of Health. During that time, the state was becoming convinced of the need to require Varicella and Hep A vaccinations for children.
We epidemiologists (in charge of studying disease outbreaks) often discussed the very rare percentages of children and/or adults experiencing severe reactions from either Varicella or Hep A (mainly the immunocompromised and elderly), and it made little sense to me that the state should suddenly decide to force vaccinations for these diseases on children as a necessity to attend school.
It still doesn’t—and here’s why.
Hepatitis A
The OSDH School Vaccination sheet for parents explains that about 100 people a year die from hepatitis A, and that some infected persons may not even have symptoms of the disease. The population of the United States is over 324 million. Thus, the instance of death of Hepatitis A in the United States is 0.00000031 or 0.000031% of the total population. Does that warrant a vaccine?
Chicken Pox
We’re told chicken pox is “usually mild, but it can lead to severe skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), and even death”. We’re not given the instance in the population, but several sources confirm an average of 100 chicken pox deaths before 1995 when the vaccine was introduced. Once again, we are forcing a vaccine on parents for a disease significant for three-hundred thousandths of the population?
Relatedly, the CDC has confirmed a near doubling of the incidence of shingles since 1993 (shingles is a variant of the chicken pox virus). A current theory is that, because most children no longer get chicken pox, their parents no longer get an immunological boost from the disease and their immune system ‘forgets’ how to fight it. For anyone with shingles – this is a significant issue.
Hepatitis B
Hep B symptoms are usually mild. Chronic liver infection can occur, but the older the person is at the time of infection, the less likely that risk.
According to the National Vaccine Information Center, Hep B is neither common in the US, nor highly contagious. But because it can be spread from mothers infected by IV drug use or sexual contact to their babies, the CDC advised it should be given to ALL babies/children in the US beginning in 1991.
There have been 11,052 serious adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in connection with Hep B vaccines since 1990 – a disease that only affects a subset of the total population. Why would this vaccine be mandated for school children when only those within a specific subset of the population are affected—especially in light of the recorded associated vaccine injuries?
Is it because it’s easier to remove an individual’s right to make healthcare choice than take CDC and/or state Epidemiologists away from number crunching at their computers and put them into the field to actually study disease process?
There’s a Lot of Nuance to This Topic
In a recent Federalist article—“No, Anti-Vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr. Won’t Be Trump’s ‘Vaccine Czar’”—author Julie Kelly states that “collective alarm” was raised as then-President-elect Trump met with RFK Jr. She continues, “The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children…”
It’s possible this writer doesn’t know that in 1995, the CDC recommended approximately 20 doses of 5 vaccinations from birth to 18 years of age, but by 2013, that number had expanded to 50 doses of 14 vaccinations from birth to 18.
That doesn’t seem a bit much—especially for small children with new and developing immune systems? Especially when the newest recommendations contain vaccinations for illnesses that are neither highly infectious, nor have a high mortality rate?
I’ve already discussed three of those vaccines. But let’s take a couple more: the HPV and Gardasil vaccine, and the meningitis vaccine.
HPV/Gardasil
According to the CDC, 6.2 million new sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) cases are identified each year. Of all cases, 70 percent clear within a year. Ninety percent clear within two. Apparently, an avoidance of casual sex would solve the problem of initial infection—as would monogamous sex. In addition, regular yearly PAP smears would alleviate cancer risk.
VAERS reports 37,474 vaccine reactions to Gardasil since September 2015, including 209 deaths.
Though a cervical cancer survivor, I would NEVER recommend HPV vaccination to anyone, including my own daughters, based on both the etiology of the disease and the vaccination risk.
Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the brain which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Though symptoms for all these variants are similar, four vaccines are currently used to combat bacterial meningitis, commonly called meningococcal disease. Meningitis is passed via saliva primarily and can be treated by antibiotics if identified quickly, but can be physically debilitating or deadly if not treated soon enough.
According to the CDC, “Today, meningococcal disease is at a historic low in the United States. Rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States since the 1990s, with much of the decline seen before the routine use of meningococcal vaccines” (emphasis added).
In 2013, there were only 550 total meningococcal cases. The CDC reports 8,594 VAERS events in conjunction with vaccine MenACWY-D between 2005 and 2011, including 24 deaths and 284 VAERS events with MenACWY-CRM, including one death.
Please note the fact that while there are only approximately 550 cases per year, there have been 1,480 vaccine events per year. Additional risk is apparent when HPV and Meningococcal vaccines are administered together.
Drug interaction is a known issue—it’s the reason doctors must know the medications and supplements their patients are taking before they write them a prescription.
Is it really so outrageous to believe that the possible combinations from giving a child 50 doses of 14 different vaccines couldn’t cause health issues? Just the list of contraindications for today’s vaccines should generate at least some level of deep thought before offering up that thigh, arm, or hip to a syringe.
Fearmongering Doesn’t Make Responsible Citizens
Across the United States, legislators are attempting to pass laws forcing parents to vaccinate their children and/or removing existing exemptions from current vaccine laws. Citing “public safety,” law makers such as Oklahoma’s state Sen. Irvin Yen seek to remove parental choice in vaccination based on the argument that diseases once eradicated—such as polio—will return.
Like Yen, author Kelly blames “anti-vaccine activism” for outbreaks of measles and whooping cough, yet neither Kelly nor Yen cite their reasoning.
Curiously, both Kelly and Yen seem unaware of the influx of undocumented immigrants pouring into this country daily from countries with very low vaccination rates and high instances of diseases such as whooping cough and mumps. In fact, the CDC studies rates of disease in incoming legal immigrants and reported in 2009, that 104,954 immigrants were identified as having a “medical condition” to include tuberculosis, and then admitted “the majority of immigrant records (approximately 400K) are not collected.”
Parents Aren’t Solely Responsible for Outbreaks
A recent mumps outbreak in Oklahoma spanned 8 counties, yet the highest rates of illness (66 percent) were in the vaccinated population. No vaccine confers 100 percent disease immunity, and mumps vaccine is only 88 percent effective after two doses, leaving 12 percent of the population at risk following disease exposure. Though the origination of the outbreak is unknown, the Arkansas Department of Health also reported nearly 100 confirmed cases—an indication of interstate mobility.
The median age in this outbreak was 16. Because adults often have little immunity from diseases vaccinated against in childhood, this significant part of the population can also contract and/or pass illness.
In addition, many vaccines given today contain live virus. Anyone taking a live virus vaccine can ‘shed’ the disease to others as their immune system ramps up to create antibodies against the disease. Unvaccinated persons in physical contact with a shedding vaccinated person can become ill.
Considering these factors, blaming parents whose children didn’t take the MMR for this—or any—mumps outbreak simply doesn’t add up.
Not Anti-Vax, But Pro-Informed Consent
Let me be clear. I believe parents in the United States should protect the health of their children by vaccinating them against highly infectious diseases with high mortality and/or morbidity rates. Vaccinations against polio, whooping cough, measles, diphtheria, and rubella have prevented untold thousands of deaths and health complications in this country over the decades and this fact is nothing to—excuse the term—“sneeze at.”
That said, every physician or health department responsible for vaccinating children should provide parents with all the facts about every vaccine before a needle pierces skin. Few do, and that raises a red flag. Why shouldn’t parents receive all information necessary to make an informed decision about their child’s health?
Today’s parents are getting savvy. They’re beginning to find that government doesn’t have all the answers. They don’t want half-baked “experts” telling them what to do. Let’s face it— if the USDA created the food pyramid to help out farm concerns, and the CDC bought into it, what does that say about the government’s ability to use science independently? Why not exercise some healthy skepticism about CDC vaccine recommendations?
Strident physicians and lawmakers unwilling to address concerns about vaccine safety don’t create public trust—especially when rampant anecdotal (and factual) information is easily found on the internet.
State health departments and legislators who sneer at parental concerns and call for vaccination mandates erode parents’ trust. That makes them less likely to vaccinate, which in turn makes government officials push vaccines all the more. This vicious cycle is good for no one.",['Curiously']

McCabe provided investigators with four misleading statements, three of which were while he was under oath. Giving false statements to federal investigators is a crime. In fact, it is the same crime for which the Justice Department went after President Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.
On Friday, news broke that Barr “has appointed the top federal prosecutor in St. Louis to review the criminal case against Michael Flynn – former national security adviser to President Donald Trump,” according to Reuters. This all occured in the same week an assistant U.S. attorney recommended up to nine years in prison for former Trump campaign associate Roger Stone on the grounds that he lied about gossiping about what WikiLeaks knew about Hillary Clinton’s emails.
So it appears McCabe is allowed to lie to federal investigators about corruption affecting the U.S. government, cover it up with more lies, and get off scot-free even though what he did is a crime, while Stone faces years in prison for lying about gossip that affected nothing of public importance. Flynn appears to have been entrapped by FBI agents into possibly contradicting himself while unaware that was the situation, and now faces possible prison time, to say nothing of years of legal harassment plus potential threats by prosecutors against his son. Andrew McCarthy points out the same double standard has applied to the political prosecution of former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, who “was convicted of making a trivial false statement about the date of a meeting.”
CNN’s Erin Burnett made a big deal Friday out of a federal judge saying last September that politicized decisions about whom federal lawyers prosecute are the stuff of a “banana republic.” She attempted to apply that description to the Trump Justice Department’s revisions to its prison-time request for Stone.
Yet it far better applies to unelected career bureaucrats’ use of their power to prosecute their political enemies, which comprises the heart of the “resistance” to Republican rule that will endure so long as bureaucracy has enough power to challenged elected branches of government. This bureacracy weaponization was also a hallmark of the Obama presidency, with — ironies of ironies — perhaps the biggest evidences again coming from the Department of Justice under attorneys general Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.
Remember them? The people who held tarmac meetings with Bill Clinton about hiding Hillary’s email scandal, oversaw Internal Revenue Service persecution of conservative grassroots clubs, and refused to enforce immigration laws at the behest of the president?
Now the chest-thumpers in the media are coming to obscure this weaponization of bureaucracy by attacking Trump’s frustration over the outrageous and corrupt double standards of an executive branch federal agency he is supposed to control through appointing its leaders. On Sunday, “More than 1,000 former U.S. Justice Department officials on Sunday called for Attorney General William Barr to resign” for directing the department he ostensibly controls to reduce its requested prison sentence for Stone.
On Friday, coinciding directly with the announcement of McCabe’s effective federal pardon, Sally Yates, of all people, was published in the Washington Post accusing Trump of treating Justice as “his personal grudge squad.” Yes, the deputy attorney general who helped the Obama administration set up Flynn as an early fall guy in the Spygate scandal is now taking to the pages of the Washington Post to wax poetic about DOJ’s duty to provide “impartial justice” and perform as a “neutral zone” that provides “justice without fear or favor.”
“While it is appropriate to communicate about administration policies and priorities, discussion with the White House about specific criminal cases has traditionally been off-limits,” Yates writes. Is that so? Then why was Yates, according to Obama official Susan Rice, at a meeting with President Obama about the administration’s “investigation” into the political opponents soon replacing them in the White House? Why did she “run to the White House and get it on the record that she believed Flynn to be in imminent danger of becoming a compromised national security liability, despite being fully aware that such compromise was impossible”?
Only if Yates is using cynical lies to cover her behind from what everybody will learn she and other Obama administration officials did with their power if Barr is not stopped, soon.
When the cockroaches are all scurrying across the floor, you can be sure that somebody shone a light on their nest. Earlier this week, in fact, House intelligence committee ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes told Fox Business host Lou Dobbs that the prosecutors who resigned over the altered prison recommendation for Stone are “not going to be the only example. We think there’s other examples of things that they did during the Mueller investigation that I think you and your listeners and the American people will be very interested to learn in the coming weeks, as we start to unpeel the onion of what the Mueller team was really doing.” More:
NUNES: Because I would say this, when Mueller was appointed, you have — we have to ask ourselves, he walks in the door the first day and said, OK, show me all the evidence you’ve got on the Russians. They’re like, Bob, sorry, we don’t have any Russians here. We don’t have any evidence. DOBBS: Yes. NUNES: So what the h-ll did they do for two years? They set up an obstruction of justice trap. And they sit — DOBBS: And tried — NUNES: — they went after a whole bunch of people that now got sentenced. Some already served their time. And I think all of this has to come into question now at this point.
Then on Friday, former special counsel Robert Mueller’s top “pit bull,” Andrew Weissmann, whom some speculate was the actual leader of Democrats’ unlimited Trump probe, told MSNBC host Chuck Todd that Barr’s agency has opened another investigation into McCabe plus fellow FBI corrupt-o-crats James Comey and Peter Strzok.
The real investigators are closing in on the crooked cops. No wonder they’re freaking out and using their media friends to start helping them pretend all of a sudden that they care about “democracy” while using their power to subvert the presidential administration Americans elected in 2016. What Barr is doing is what “oversight” looks like: When unelected bureaucrats are called to publicly account for what they have done with the public purse, time, and trust.
Once the whole truth has finally come out, Congress needs to be thinking about how they are going to make sure this never happens again. They will not do that by making the Department of Justice even less accountable to elected officials, as Democrats are demanding. They will do it by slashing and burning the bureaucracy and its powers. Government by and for the people will perish from the earth if unelected officials are capable of weaponizing government against the people’s elected representatives. That’s what a banana republic really is. And we don’t want one here.","['slashing', 'and', 'burning', 'weaponizing', 'government', 'perish']"

“To end the real and growing threat of climate change and to create a more just country for everyone, we must heal these past mistakes and act boldly to create a green and equitable future. That’s exactly what I’ll do as president,” Booker said in a statement.
The plan includes an array of executive actions, such as taking on companies that pollute with increased EPA enforcement, requiring all new passenger vehicles to have zero emissions by 2030, and imposing a ban on all new fossil fuel leases. Booker also intends to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and revoke orders from President Trump to approve the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines.
Additionally, Booker wants to push Congress to create a United States Environmental Justice Fund, which would commit $50 billion a year “to advance environmental justice and invest in communities long left behind.” Goals include replacing lead drinking water service lines in residences, schools, and daycares; cleaning abandoned uranium, coal, and hard rock mines; and planting 100 million trees in urban areas that Booker's plan says suffer disproportionately from air pollution.

 Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,16.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.",['deter']
"Since 2016, Democrats have thrown sand, wrenches, and donkey poo into every gear of government to overturn the results of a free and fair election played by rules.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/11/impeachment-is-just-another-word-for-delusional-democrats-holding-the-nation-hostage/,federalist,vaccines,right,16.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democrats have been forcing us to watch 'Groundhog Day: Trump Edition' for three years straight because they refuse to accept that in America, the people are the sovereign, not the deep state Democrats control.
Democrat’s impeachment inquiry is more than merely “boring.” It’s also an abuse of their power. They’re forcing us to watch “Groundhog Day: Overturn The 2016 Election” for three years straight because they refuse to accept that in America, the people are the sovereign, not the deep state Democrats control.
Democrats have made it clear they will sandbag the people we’ve elected to govern if we refuse to vote for Democrats. Heads they win, tails we lose. Either we vote for them, or be stuck in an endless parade of overcredentialed and underaccomplished finger-waggers until we’re browbeaten into staying home from elections after concluding that it doesn’t matter who we vote for, the left always wins.
Impeachment grand master Rep. Adam Schiff said it openly on Tuesday: Unless Democrats impeach President Trump, Democrats will consider the 2020 election illegitimate, just like they do 2016.
VIDEO – Adam Schiff: We Can’t Conduct a Free and Fair Election in 2020 Unless We Impeach Trump https://t.co/rHfJ0IXdbb — Grabien (@GrabienMedia) December 10, 2019
It appears Schiff failed to hear the outcome of a two-year, unlimited-resources special counsel investigation that found Trump’s campaign had not colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But Schiff doesn’t care about the facts. He cares about winning. If lying makes him win, so be it. It obviously works extremely well for Democrats, a large faction and the leadership of which appears to be as impervious to facts as anti-vaxxers and QAnon followers.
Chuck Todd asks House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler if Trump is not removed from office, “will we have a fair election in 2020?”
pic.twitter.com/R1hhFv9leI — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 8, 2019
Contra Schiff, Todd, and Nadler, about six in ten Americans think impeachment should be resolved not by Congress, but by voters in the next election. Sixty percent of Americans Politico polled in November said the impeachment inquiry is more important to politicians and the media than it is to them.
On that poll, impeachment ranked 10 out of 11 political priorities voters were polled about, below even addressing climate change. The economy, national security (including border security), and health care are voters’ top three priorities.
It’s Our Congress and We’ll Lie If We Want To
But Democrats don’t seem to care what voters want. Since 2016, Democrats have thrown sand, wrenches, and donkey poo into every gear of government to overturn the results of a free and fair election played by rules (i.e. the Electoral College) known to all in advance. They’ve attempted at every point to undermine the election results and deny the spoils due the victor. Rather than attempting to advance fairly by persuading more people of their ideas, they’ve resorted to unending, underhanded tricks to win despite failing to present a vision for the country that can fairly win a governing majority.
The most constant of these tricks might be the personal smears constantly and thickly applied to everyone on the right. It’s not just Trump who is a racist. Everyone who believes in free markets and equality before the law is a racist. That may sound crazy, but that’s what lefty college students scream at mainstream conservatives constantly, and they aren’t getting these ideas from their own empty brains.
Or try unsupported sexual and other assault charges, as deployed against Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, Sen. Ted Cruz, and initial Trump nominee for labor secretary Andy Pudzer. Even if there is no evidence for them and evidence against, such accusations will make life hell for the accused, make huge numbers of people suspicious of their accomplishments, and occupy months of congressional resources that they could be using on the people’s business.
Same thing for basic obstruction of judicial nominees: “Since President Donald Trump took office, the… percentage of judicial nominees facing opposition – even a single vote – to confirmation has skyrocketed from the traditional 3 percent to more than 70 percent.”
Then there’s always the good old lawsuit. The left has specialized in suing President Trump’s administration for doing exactly the same things President Obama did, simply in reverse and in closer contact with the law. They’ve also specialized in using biased judges as unelected superlegislatures to impose national dictats: “nationwide injunctions were never employed for the first 175 years of our republic. But… [they] were used 22 times within the president’s first two years in office.”
This has allowed, for one example, “a single unelected judge appointed by the opposition party [to control] the nation’s immigration policy for now three years despite an election in which the American people voted for a man who promised to reverse that policy to instead follow the actual law.”
It doesn’t stop there, of course. Attorney General William Barr noted “the pursuit of scores of parallel ‘investigations’ through an avalanche of subpoenas” that are “plainly designed to incapacitate the Executive Branch.”
Atop all this are other leftist mobilizations against the people’s decision in 2016: bureaucrats paid by taxpayers contemptuously organizing against their elected boss, the two-year Spygate hoax that appears to comprise the Obama administration using government resources and Soviet-style allegations to spy on their political opposition, and the public harassment of Trump officials to the point of following them into restaurants and their homes screaming, shouting, banging drums, whistling, and shouting threats.
In short, the left’s response to the right scoring a goal in 2016 was to grab the ball and stomp their feet for three years, like the protesters stopping the Yale-Harvard football game to protest climate change. But in Congress, the stakes are a lot higher than football.
To give just one example, while everyone is force-fed impeachment drivel, Congress is busy not passing another regular budget for its 23rd straight year. We’ve been run for a quarter-century on crap-sandwich “continuing resolutions” that are bringing us frighteningly close to curb-stomping the world’s largest economy.
Rachel Bovard points out at American Greatness other things Congress is not doing while impeachment sucks oxygen:
There is also no effort to limit any money going to Planned Parenthood or to pass legislation such as the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act… President Trump has requested $5 billion to continue building a wall along the southern border. It goes without saying that Democrats are opposed, but it doesn’t appear that Republicans are prepared to put up much of a fight for the president’s signature priority, either. Legislators also continue to ignore the fact that Mexico is rapidly descending into a gangland—a problem that Congress could begin to address by designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. But don’t expect that to be included in any spending bill, either.
There is a silver lining to Democrats’ obstruction. In the past century, when Congress has gotten together to “get things done” it has done more harm than good. In Washington DC, “bipartisanship” is the equivalent for conservatives of pointing a cannon at their own ship’s floorboards and firing. “Bipartisanship” means Democrats get half of what they want and Republican voters get screwed.
This good ol’ boys national suicide compact of the last century has produced a legislative vertical asymptote, with socialism as infinity.
Inaction Is Action
Gridlock and inactivity is better than that. Or at least, it will be until our entitlements actually do explode, which is set to begin within seven years. At that point, inaction will no longer be an option.
Bipartisanship as we know it is probably over, and Obamacare probably fired the kill shot. In fact, we may already be past the point on entitlements where not acting equals acting.
The same is true of the southern border, as Mexico also slow-motion implodes. U.S. classrooms where 15 languages are already represented are not going to handle well even more poorly educated non-citizens entitled by court decisions to a taxpayer-provided U.S. education, and that’s just the start of the impending strain on America’s poorly maintained and outdated social infrastructure.
This is unacceptable. It is not the behavior of a party ready to govern.
Democrats are spending their time grandstanding because they’re out of winning ideas. They have only negative ideas — “income inequality,” “collusion,” “white privilege,” “America sucks,” “toxic masculinity,” “socialism” — nothing positive. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is so crazy left that if they actually passed the laws they want, like with Obamacare, they’d lose elections good and hard. They win more when they do nothing but slime and delegitimize their opponents and keep them in the mud losing, too.
Yet Republicans are also rightfully in the wilderness. They’ve been Democrats’ impressionable little brother for too long, adopting the same ideas but slower, smaller, and cheaper. Their inability to present a robust alternative is another reason to beware them taking power. Why, the last time they had it, just a short year ago, they squandered the golden opportunity of the first House, Senate, and presidency controlled by Republicans since George W. Bush, which until then hadn’t happened in 79 years and was also squandered profligately.
Under Bush, we got garbage like No Child Left Behind, the neverending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Patriot Act, and a massive Medicare expansion. When Republicans retook all houses under Trump, they failed to move legislation they’d been campaigning on for the entirety of President Obama’s tenure (cough cough, Obamacare replacement; Planned Parenthood defunding), not to mention nothing major Trump had campaigned on except a tax cut. Current promises of price controls to “help” with prescription drugs, a surely pork-stuffed “infrastructure” bill, and Republicans’ lame answers to Democrats’ demands for socialized college inspire no confidence, either.
This is unacceptable. It is not the behavior of a party ready to govern. When governing was possible, Republicans diddled. They appear to have no big ideas for future governance, either. Democrats’ unhinged circus is a just punishment for Republicans’ failure to deserve majority votes. It’s long past time for the GOP to figure out what they’re going to do about our nation’s serious problems if they ever win again, and develop the political courage to advance those ideas under fire.","['sand', 'donkey', 'poo', 'thrown', 'Democrats']"
Here are three obvious but important ways the media demonstrated a disgusting partisan slant instead of good journalism.,https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/04/3-ways-media-hacks-are-dangerously-politicizing-vaccines/,federalist,vaccines,right,16.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Last year the Centers for Disease Control reported 644 domestic cases of measles, a respiratory disease spread through the air. Already in January of this year there are 102 people in 14 states who have it, most of this related to being at Disneyland in mid-December. That’s the main reason why California has 92 of those 102 confirmed cases. The disease was eliminated in the United States by 2000 but can be brought back and spread via international travelers. All states have rules requiring a measles vaccine for children in public school but some exemptions are allowed. The exemptions are disconcerting to some.
We see stories such as this one from September in The Atlantic: “Wealthy L.A. Schools’ Vaccination Rates Are as Low as South Sudan’s: Hollywood parents say not vaccinating makes ‘instinctive’ sense.” The full story from The Hollywood Reporter is fascinating. More recently we saw this from a local CBS affiliate: “Berkeley’s Measles Ultimatum: 21-Day Quarantine For Unvaccinated Kids If Outbreak Spreads.” BuzzFeed notes that half of the children that attend some Marin County schools north of San Francisco are not vaccinated. The Washington Post notes that the California communities where anti-vaccinators cluster are also the most liberal, voting overwhelmingly for President Obama.
For some reason, many in the media (as well as other liberal commentators) decided to try to make this story about a measles outbreak in California and a concern about vaccination rates in Hollywood, Marin County and Berkeley into an existential problem for — stay with me here because it makes zero sense if you’re not a hack — the Republican Party and conservatives. It’s an odd, perhaps even desperate and clownish, choice. But such is what our political media does these days. See, for example, the completely manufactured and orchestrated “War on Women.”
Here are three obvious but important ways the media demonstrated a disgusting partisan slant instead of good journalism.
1. It is indefensible to spin this as a problem for Republicans.
What got liberals in the media going this week was a statement made by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican:
“Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated, and we think that it’s an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health,” the likely 2016 presidential candidate said while in Cambridge, England. The Republican also noted: “I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.”
Not three days earlier, we had this nearly identical statement from the White House, currently occupied by a Democrat. Nota bene: the President is actually the highest office in the land, even higher than the governor of New Jersey:
""Well, the President certainly believes that these kinds of decisions are decisions that should be made by parents, because ultimately when we’re talking about vaccinations, we’re typically talking about vaccinations that are given to children. But the science on this, as our public health professionals I’m sure would be happy to tell you, the science on this is really clear.""
Both President Obama and Gov. Christie are, in fact, articulating what is state policy in all 50 states. At least to some degree. All 50 states require vaccination and all 50 allow parents to opt-out for medical reasons. All but two allow opt-outs for religious or other reasons. The two that allow no non-medical opt-outs? The super-liberal Democratic states of … oh dear, this doesn’t fit the narrative at all, does it … Mississippi and West Virginia.
Now, outfits such as Mother Jones, Rolling Stone and Salon have all published anti-vaccination pieces in the past decade. The latter two, in fact, published a piece by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. You can probably guess a little something about his political affiliation. But that doesn’t mean that concerns about vaccination are exclusively on the left.
A late January survey by YouGov asked “Do you think early childhood vaccinations can cause autism?” The percentage who responded “definitely” or “probably”: 13% of Democrats, 15% of Independents and 11% of Republicans. It also asked, “When it comes to childhood diseases, like measles, mumps, and whooping cough, should all children be required to get vaccinations or should parents be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children?” More on the inadequacies of this question later, but 70% of Democrats, 48% of Independents and 57% of Republicans said it should be required. The survey asked “Have you received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations?” Republicans were most likely to say yes, at 78%. Democrats and Independents were tied at 69%. Republicans were also most likely to say that they had vaccinated their children, with 88% saying they had, compared to 82% of Democrats with children and 79% of Independents. Finally, Republicans were also more informed about the measles outbreak, with 84% reporting they knew about it compared to 66% of Democrats and Independents. To put it mildly, this is not an issue on which you see a clear partisan divide, particularly not in one particular direction.
But many in our political media — not known for being deep thinkers but known for loving to play gotcha, no matter how little it brings to the discussion — decided that this issue of Berkeley, Marin County and Hollywood parents needed to be jujitsued into a problem for the GOP.
A perfect example comes from Jeremy W. Peters of the New York Times:
The politics of medicine, morality and free will collide as GOP debates itself again over established science: http://t.co/Ofd6v1fTzH
Jeremy W. Peters (@jwpetersNYT) February 3, 2015
Here’s some text from his story. Again, this is the New York Times and not Daily Kos diaries:
Oh for crying out loud. The desperation. Imagine if you got your news only from the New York Times, and how bigoted that would make you against non-liberals.
Anyway, Peters and other groupthinkers went around writing stories about how Republicans have some huge vaccine problem, facts be cast aside. And they went out of their way to ask GOP politicians questions about whether they agreed with this largely universal vaccination approach. But then they framed such agreement in the most nefarious of terms. This was only practiced on GOP politicians, mind you. Not Democrats.
Fun fact about Jeremy W. Peters. I tweeted:
New rule: 100% of journalists must ask 100% of Democrats when science says life begins before uttering the word “vaccine” even one more time
Mollie (@MZHemingway) February 3, 2015
A reader reminded me of a curious historical footnote. A few years ago John McCormack, a reporter for the Weekly Standard, asked Nancy Pelosi, “What is the moral difference between what Dr. Gosnell did to a baby born alive at 23 weeks and aborting her moments before birth?” Now, political journalists know that only pro-life candidates should be on the receiving end of difficult abortion questions. So it’s funny to note what the transcript of this reporter scrum says next (spoiler: Pelosi doesn’t answer the question and no other reporter presses it):
PELOSI: You're probably enjoying that question a lot, I can see you savoring it. [Laughter in press corps] Let me just tell you this.
Who was the reporter in question? It was Peters. Peters bust a gut laughing. Isn’t that so weird? That the same reporter who is making up crap about vaccines being a political problem for Republicans would help out Nancy Pelosi when a single reporter asks her a tough question about her radical abortion stance? That is so weird!
But, yeah, good work each and every one of you reporters who made this fake story something to waste time on this week. You’re all hacks.
2. Hypocrisy in pandemic fear
Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, sore throat and all-over body rash. According to the Washington Post:
Fatalities are rare in the United States, but one or two of every 1,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease, according to Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. More common complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and deafness. Pregnant women who get the measles may give birth prematurely or deliver low-birth-weight babies.
Symptoms of Ebola include, according to the CDC:
Fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal (stomach) pain, unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or bruising).
The fatality rate for Ebola cases from last year is 71%, according to the CDC.
No one wants to get measles, a disease we know a fair bit about and which many Americans of a certain age contracted as children. But it doesn’t even come close to the scare of getting Ebola and having it liquify your organs.
Remember how the media treated Americans who were a bit freaked out about the spread of Ebola? I do. See “Media Should Stop Lecturing Americans About Their Ebola Concerns” and “Media’s ‘Panic Panic’ Is Reaching New Annoying Levels With Quarantines.” The joke of a site PolitiFact even made concerns about Ebola it’s “Lie of the Year.”
You may remember that NBC journalist Nancy Snyderman broke her Ebola quarantine, to the outrage of her neighbors. You will never believe what she tweeted this week:
When free will trumps public health we put our nation's most vulnerable at risk. That doesn't seem very American to me. Vaccinate #measles
Dr. Nancy Snyderman (@DrNancyNBCNEWS) February 3, 2015
Yes, the same woman who broke her Ebola quarantine wrote that tweet.
On that note, remember the media outrage when certain governors took the Ebola threat more seriously than some in the media? It was crazy. Read this link for some of the details, but a nurse who was quarantined by Chris Christie said her human rights had been violated. Various reporters were absolutely outraged that readers didn’t seem to care about this.
But now that you have certain politicians saying it’s important to balance public health programs with concerns about liberty, the media are in full-on panic mode, writing as many stories they can about how Sen. Rand Paul is the world’s greatest threat. Here, for example is how one journalist responded to a tweet by Rand Paul (since deleted and language warning).
Talk about hysteria.
Listen, I’m generally on the side of people who fear bad diseases, whether they’re the liquifying organs kind or the bad rash on your body kind, and whether there’s a widespread vaccine in use against it or not. But could we get some consistency here? A standard other than the “be on the side that hurts Republicans” standard the media are experts in?
3. Defining the terms
NPR had an interesting story four years ago about vaccination and public health threats. Here’s a portion of the discussion with Michael Willrich, author of “Pox: An American History.”
From the very start of the organized vaccination campaign against smallpox, there was public resistance, says Willrich. The battle between the government and the vocal anti-vaccinators came to a head in a landmark 1902 Supreme Court decision, where the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state to order a vaccination for its population during an epidemic to protect the people from a devastating disease. ""But at the same time, the Court recognized certain limitations on that power — that this power of health policing was no absolute and was not total and there was a sphere of individual liberty that needed to be recognized,"" says Willrich. ""Measures like this needed to be reasonable and someone who could make a legitimate claim that a vaccine posed a particular risk to them because of their family history or medical history [would not have to be vaccinated.]"" In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stipulated that a state couldn't forcibly vaccinate its population. ""[They said,] 'Of course, it would be unconstitutional and go beyond the pale for health officials to forcibly vaccinate anyone because that's not within their power,'"" says Willrich. ""And I think that's really a shoutout to the Boston health authorities who were employing forcible vaccination all the time in the poorest neighborhoods in the city.""
Would these court decisions be called “anti-vaxxer,” the media adjective du jour? Consider this tweet from BuzzFeed’s Adam Serwer:
here's a weird CW that anti vaxxers are mostly lefties but it's a ver bipartisan fringe http://t.co/tCtYOnnGdr pic.twitter.com/CotlsRys57
Adam Serwer (@AdamSerwer) February 3, 2015
Leaving aside the idea that 26% to 30% of a group could be described as fringe, what we see is a conflation of opposition to vaccines with opposition to forced government vaccination. Here might be another example.
What does “mandatory” vaccination mean? Does it mean something that allows that the “power of health policing is not absolute” as the Courts might say? Or does it mean we fine and jail parents who choose not to vaccinate their children? Does it mean we take children away from parents who don’t vaccinate? Or does it mean we don’t allow non-vaccinated children in public schools?
Does it matter why parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children? Is it because they have moral objections to using vaccines developed from aborted babies? Is it because their child has medical problems that would be compounded by a vaccine injection? Is it because they’re philosophically opposed to medicine? Is it because they believe discredited studies about a link between autism and vaccines? What lines should be drawn?
I get that the media really want to do some bullcrap horse-race point-scoring partisan sniping right now. But these are actually important questions. And “gotcha” reporting may get you butt-slapped by your fellow reporters at the bar, but it’s actually really dangerous.
Vaccinations are too important to be sucked into a politicized debate and the media should be ashamed for trying so hard to make it so. Vaccines are one of the most agreed-upon topics regardless of political leaning. We already mandate vaccinations in 50 states. Journalistic discussion of whether the exemptions to these mandates are too broad or too narrow is legitimate, even if media panic seems a bit overwrought right now. There is no way that debate goes well if it becomes the media’s next “War on Women” type exercise of water carrying for Democrats.","['disgusting', 'partisan', 'slant']"
"A shocking new study says that the ice in the Arctic Ocean will disappear by 2050, which could have ""substantial"" implications on the ecosystem and the climate in the region.",https://www.foxnews.com/science/arctic-ocean-ice-free-summers-next-30-years,fox-news,environment,right,17.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"A shocking new study says that the ice in the Arctic Ocean will disappear by 2050, which could have ""substantial"" implications on the ecosystem and the climate in the region.
The study notes that ice levels during the summer have been steadily shrinking over the past 30 years, due to climate change. The researchers ran a number of simulations, with most showing the ""the Arctic Ocean becomes practically sea ice-free (sea‐ice area < 1 million km2) in September for the first time before the year 2050.""
“While the Arctic sea ice extent is decreasing during this transition to an ice-free Arctic, the year-to-year variability in extent greatly increases, making life more difficult for local populations and ice-dependent species,” said study co-author Bruno Tremblay, associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill University, in a statement.
GREENLAND SHED ENORMOUS 600B TONS OF ICE LAST YEAR, SCIENTISTS WARN
The researchers add that the sea-ice loss in the future is dependent on carbon emissions. ""If emissions are reduced rapidly, ice-free years only occur occasionally,"" the statement added. ""With higher emissions, the Arctic Ocean will become ice-free in most years.""
More than 40 climate models from 21 research institutes around the world were used by the researchers to come up with their findings. The rapid decline in sea ice levels is believed to be linked to high carbon dioxide emissions and ""little climate protection,"" according to the statement.
The research was published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters.
In September 2019, the sea ice level in the Arctic was the second lowest on record, just 1.6 million square miles, Fox News previously reported.
Since the late 1970s, when satellite records were first kept, NSIDC reports that the 13 smallest sea ice minimums have all occurred in the last 13 years. The lowest amount on record came in 2012, when sea ice dropped to 1.37 million square miles.
In November, it was reported that the Arctic's most stable sea ice area, known as ""Last Ice Area,"" is disappearing faster than researchers initially believed.
The sea ice minimum area has declined 12.8 percent per decade over the past 40 years, which scientists believe is partially a result of climate change.
Skeptics have largely dismissed fears over man’s impact on global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time. They also claim the dangers of a warming planet are being wildly exaggerated and question the impact that fossil fuels have had on climate change.

Letters from GOP members of Congress and national pro-life leaders to the White House and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week asserted Democrats are attempting to exploit the coronavirus pandemic for the purpose of advancing their party’s pro-abortion agenda.
Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) tweeted in a video message he had joined 35 other senators in urging President Donald Trump to “keep up his strong support for pro-life policies, even during this coronavirus crisis”:
President @realDonaldTrump has been a bold advocate for life. This week I joined 35 other senators urging him to stand strong against those who want to exploit the #coronavirus crisis. Fetal tissue research is NOT the answer to curing #COVIDー19. pic.twitter.com/AuBm9q9W0A — Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) April 15, 2020
Wicker explained Republican senators wrote to the president in response to a letter sent by 15 Democrat attorneys general from around the country, asking Trump to ease restrictions on the use of aborted fetal tissue for research on coronavirus vaccines.
“Our scientists have proved that there are many better ways to get more accurate research and better results using research that doesn’t involve use of abortions and the taking of an innocent human life,” the senator added.
Wicker and his fellow senators wrote to the president about the Democrats pro-abortion agenda:
These attempts to exploit the current crisis faced by our nation undermine your leadership and the promising research that is already underway. In reality, holding the line ethically gives us the ability to put resources toward better science that is already showing promise against the coronavirus. Therefore, we urge you to stand strong in rejecting these appeals for taxpayer dollars to be used for the practice of using aborted babies in experiments.
A list of the U.S. senators who co-signed Wicker’s letter can be found at his website.
In the House, Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) also launched a letter with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and Pro-Life Caucus Chairman Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) that urges the president to maintain his strong pro-life policies against Democrats’ attempts to use the current pandemic to advance their party’s pro-abortion platform.
Glad to lead this effort for life. During this crisis, the last thing anyone should do is try and advance the left’s radical abortion agenda. I am thankful for @realDonaldTrump leadership in this crucial time.https://t.co/wfNrxokFHe — Rep. Doug Lamborn (@RepDLamborn) April 17, 2020
Lamborn said in a statement:
During this crisis, the last thing anyone should do is try and advance the left’s radical abortion agenda. Life is precious at all stages and any claim to the contrary is unconscionable. We will find a cure for the current Coronavirus, but using tissue from aborted babies to do so is unethical and wrong. I’m thankful that President Trump has taken such a strong stand for life, and I’m confident a solution can be found while also maintaining the sanctity of life.
Significant research has been done that proves aborted fetal tissue is not necessary for the development of vaccines.
In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Dr. Tara Sander Lee at the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, said, “President Trump took decisive action in June of last year to curtail HHS funding of fetal tissue research using aborted baby body parts.”
She added:
This decision paved the way for the funding of research that does not rely on the needless destruction of unborn human life. Ensuring taxpayer dollars are invested in research methods that are scientifically proven to be effective, rather than unethical and ineffective, was a huge victory for life and science. We expect the President’s policy to continue to be implemented across federally funded research projects.
House Democrats, including Reps. Jan Schakowsky (IL), Jared Huffman (CA), and Diana DeGette (CO), sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on April 6, urging Secretary Alex Azar to waive restrictions on research using aborted fetal tissue for vaccine research.
The Democrats wrote to Azar:
You have repeatedly stated that your agency is doing everything you can to develop vaccines and treatments for the novel coronavirus. However, in June 2019 your agency banned all intramural research using human fetal tissue and placed new restrictions on extramural research, including review by an ethics panel that still has yet to be set up. As a result, scientists at the National Institute of Health (NIH) and across the country have been stopped from pursuing promising biomedical research into conditions and diseases that affect millions because it involves the use of human fetal tissue—including coronavirus research.
Another bicameral letter initiated by Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Rep. Robert Latta (R-OH) urged Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the FDA, to maintain regulations on drug-induced abortions. Planned Parenthood, for example, has recently touted the organization has ramped up at-home abortions with its new “telehealth” service.
With hospitals pushed to their limits by #COVID19, we should minimize, not increase, unrelated pressures on health care providers. @boblatta & I lead an effort to urge @SteveFDA not to let up on REMS abortion drugs restrictions during the crisis. https://t.co/jSUpCIz5jc @SBAList pic.twitter.com/yk3mxJW2P7 — U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (@SenHydeSmith) April 14, 2020
One Planned Parenthood official in New York State said the organization’s new telehealth program is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion “at home with her children running around behind her.”
Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP) the abortion chain is seeing “an uptick in patients seeking abortions” during the coronavirus pandemic.
“We provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance,” Shah said. “We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.”
The letter, signed by 38 U.S. senators and 121 members of the House, urged the FDA to maintain its regulations in order to protect women from predatory abortion providers:
As you may know, the New York Times editorial board and others have called for making medication abortion more widely accessible with far less oversight – via an overturning of the REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] and an expansion of the stage of pregnancy at which Mifeprex may be prescribed. These demands are both reckless and dangerous. The FDA should stand confidently for the protection of women.
A coalition of pro-life leaders has also sent a letter to Hahn, urging that his agency continue support for ethical vaccine research that eliminates an incentive for more abortions.
In a statement about the coalition’s effort, pro-life leader Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said: “The abortion industry’s attempts to increase its profits by advocating for the use of the bodies of aborted infants must be stopped, and our government needs to control how research is advanced.”
“We all want a treatment for the coronavirus, and we need to work toward a humanely developed vaccine,” she added. “Life-saving efforts must be built on an ethical foundation.”","['pro-life', 'exploit', 'pro-abortion']"
"The Guardian, insisting that the climate emergency is “the defining issue of our times,” has amped up its climate agitation by suggesting that Australian wildfires is the new normal.

The Guardian, which has publicly pledged “to give global heating, wildlife extinction and pollution the urgent attention and prominence they demand,” insisting that the climate emergency is “the defining issue of our times,” has amped up its climate agitation by suggesting that Australian wildfires is the new normal.
Despite the fact that the “area of land burned around the world has decreased in recent years,” Guardian environment correspondent Fiona Harvey confidently writes that if current emission levels are maintained we can expect burning everywhere.
Citing one of the Guardian’s favorite climate “experts,” Richard A. Betts, head of the Climate Impacts strategic area at the Met Office Hadley Centre in Exeter, Harvey says that Australia’s fires would be normal if global temperatures were to rise by 3ºC above pre-industrial levels.
Betts, who along with others has pushed for an intensification of climate rhetoric, such as replacing “global warming” with “global heating,” said that Australia is “a sign of what would be normal conditions in a 3C world. It tells us what the future world might look like.”
“This really brings home what climate change means,” he said.
Beyond a rise of 2ºC “the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible,” Harvey declares, “yet current global commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris agreement are estimated to put the world on track for 3C of heating.”
The “extreme bushfires in Australia showed what climate change would mean in reality,” Harvey writes, citing Betts.
“It is getting worse all the time,” Betts said. “The sooner we rein back emissions, the sooner we can slow the increase.”
Last May, the Guardian announced it had updated its official in-house style guide to turn up the heat on its climate change rhetoric, adopting new terminology meant to alarm readers and motivate them to action.
“Instead of ‘climate change’ the preferred terms are ‘climate emergency, crisis or breakdown’ and ‘global heating’ is favoured over ‘global warming,’ although the original terms are not banned,” the article stated.
“The phrase ‘climate change,’ for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity,” said Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief and a firm believer in the impending climate apocalypse.
The Guardian also declared it would no longer refer to those who question reigning beliefs regarding anthropogenic climate change as “climate skeptics” but will attempt to discredit them with the label “climate deniers.”

Democrat’s impeachment inquiry is more than merely “boring.” It’s also an abuse of their power. They’re forcing us to watch “Groundhog Day: Overturn The 2016 Election” for three years straight because they refuse to accept that in America, the people are the sovereign, not the deep state Democrats control.
Democrats have made it clear they will sandbag the people we’ve elected to govern if we refuse to vote for Democrats. Heads they win, tails we lose. Either we vote for them, or be stuck in an endless parade of overcredentialed and underaccomplished finger-waggers until we’re browbeaten into staying home from elections after concluding that it doesn’t matter who we vote for, the left always wins.
Impeachment grand master Rep. Adam Schiff said it openly on Tuesday: Unless Democrats impeach President Trump, Democrats will consider the 2020 election illegitimate, just like they do 2016.

It appears Schiff failed to hear the outcome of a two-year, unlimited-resources special counsel investigation that found Trump’s campaign had not colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But Schiff doesn’t care about the facts. He cares about winning. If lying makes him win, so be it. It obviously works extremely well for Democrats, a large faction and the leadership of which appears to be as impervious to facts as anti-vaxxers and QAnon followers.
Chuck Todd asks House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler if Trump is not removed from office, “will we have a fair election in 2020?”
pic.twitter.com/R1hhFv9leI — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 8, 2019
Contra Schiff, Todd, and Nadler, about six in ten Americans think impeachment should be resolved not by Congress, but by voters in the next election. Sixty percent of Americans Politico polled in November said the impeachment inquiry is more important to politicians and the media than it is to them.
On that poll, impeachment ranked 10 out of 11 political priorities voters were polled about, below even addressing climate change. The economy, national security (including border security), and health care are voters’ top three priorities.
It’s Our Congress and We’ll Lie If We Want To
But Democrats don’t seem to care what voters want. Since 2016, Democrats have thrown sand, wrenches, and donkey poo into every gear of government to overturn the results of a free and fair election played by rules (i.e. the Electoral College) known to all in advance. They’ve attempted at every point to undermine the election results and deny the spoils due the victor. Rather than attempting to advance fairly by persuading more people of their ideas, they’ve resorted to unending, underhanded tricks to win despite failing to present a vision for the country that can fairly win a governing majority.
The most constant of these tricks might be the personal smears constantly and thickly applied to everyone on the right. It’s not just Trump who is a racist. Everyone who believes in free markets and equality before the law is a racist. That may sound crazy, but that’s what lefty college students scream at mainstream conservatives constantly, and they aren’t getting these ideas from their own empty brains.
Or try unsupported sexual and other assault charges, as deployed against Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, Sen. Ted Cruz, and initial Trump nominee for labor secretary Andy Pudzer. Even if there is no evidence for them and evidence against, such accusations will make life hell for the accused, make huge numbers of people suspicious of their accomplishments, and occupy months of congressional resources that they could be using on the people’s business.
Same thing for basic obstruction of judicial nominees: “Since President Donald Trump took office, the… percentage of judicial nominees facing opposition – even a single vote – to confirmation has skyrocketed from the traditional 3 percent to more than 70 percent.”
Then there’s always the good old lawsuit. The left has specialized in suing President Trump’s administration for doing exactly the same things President Obama did, simply in reverse and in closer contact with the law. They’ve also specialized in using biased judges as unelected superlegislatures to impose national dictats: “nationwide injunctions were never employed for the first 175 years of our republic. But… [they] were used 22 times within the president’s first two years in office.”
This has allowed, for one example, “a single unelected judge appointed by the opposition party [to control] the nation’s immigration policy for now three years despite an election in which the American people voted for a man who promised to reverse that policy to instead follow the actual law.”
It doesn’t stop there, of course. Attorney General William Barr noted “the pursuit of scores of parallel ‘investigations’ through an avalanche of subpoenas” that are “plainly designed to incapacitate the Executive Branch.”
Atop all this are other leftist mobilizations against the people’s decision in 2016: bureaucrats paid by taxpayers contemptuously organizing against their elected boss, the two-year Spygate hoax that appears to comprise the Obama administration using government resources and Soviet-style allegations to spy on their political opposition, and the public harassment of Trump officials to the point of following them into restaurants and their homes screaming, shouting, banging drums, whistling, and shouting threats.
In short, the left’s response to the right scoring a goal in 2016 was to grab the ball and stomp their feet for three years, like the protesters stopping the Yale-Harvard football game to protest climate change. But in Congress, the stakes are a lot higher than football.
To give just one example, while everyone is force-fed impeachment drivel, Congress is busy not passing another regular budget for its 23rd straight year. We’ve been run for a quarter-century on crap-sandwich “continuing resolutions” that are bringing us frighteningly close to curb-stomping the world’s largest economy.
Rachel Bovard points out at American Greatness other things Congress is not doing while impeachment sucks oxygen:
There is also no effort to limit any money going to Planned Parenthood or to pass legislation such as the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act… President Trump has requested $5 billion to continue building a wall along the southern border. It goes without saying that Democrats are opposed, but it doesn’t appear that Republicans are prepared to put up much of a fight for the president’s signature priority, either. Legislators also continue to ignore the fact that Mexico is rapidly descending into a gangland—a problem that Congress could begin to address by designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. But don’t expect that to be included in any spending bill, either.
There is a silver lining to Democrats’ obstruction. In the past century, when Congress has gotten together to “get things done” it has done more harm than good. In Washington DC, “bipartisanship” is the equivalent for conservatives of pointing a cannon at their own ship’s floorboards and firing. “Bipartisanship” means Democrats get half of what they want and Republican voters get screwed.
This good ol’ boys national suicide compact of the last century has produced a legislative vertical asymptote, with socialism as infinity.
Inaction Is Action
Gridlock and inactivity is better than that. Or at least, it will be until our entitlements actually do explode, which is set to begin within seven years. At that point, inaction will no longer be an option.
Bipartisanship as we know it is probably over, and Obamacare probably fired the kill shot. In fact, we may already be past the point on entitlements where not acting equals acting.
The same is true of the southern border, as Mexico also slow-motion implodes. U.S. classrooms where 15 languages are already represented are not going to handle well even more poorly educated non-citizens entitled by court decisions to a taxpayer-provided U.S. education, and that’s just the start of the impending strain on America’s poorly maintained and outdated social infrastructure.
This is unacceptable. It is not the behavior of a party ready to govern.
Democrats are spending their time grandstanding because they’re out of winning ideas. They have only negative ideas — “income inequality,” “collusion,” “white privilege,” “America sucks,” “toxic masculinity,” “socialism” — nothing positive. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is so crazy left that if they actually passed the laws they want, like with Obamacare, they’d lose elections good and hard. They win more when they do nothing but slime and delegitimize their opponents and keep them in the mud losing, too.
Yet Republicans are also rightfully in the wilderness. They’ve been Democrats’ impressionable little brother for too long, adopting the same ideas but slower, smaller, and cheaper. Their inability to present a robust alternative is another reason to beware them taking power. Why, the last time they had it, just a short year ago, they squandered the golden opportunity of the first House, Senate, and presidency controlled by Republicans since George W. Bush, which until then hadn’t happened in 79 years and was also squandered profligately.
Under Bush, we got garbage like No Child Left Behind, the neverending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Patriot Act, and a massive Medicare expansion. When Republicans retook all houses under Trump, they failed to move legislation they’d been campaigning on for the entirety of President Obama’s tenure (cough cough, Obamacare replacement; Planned Parenthood defunding), not to mention nothing major Trump had campaigned on except a tax cut. Current promises of price controls to “help” with prescription drugs, a surely pork-stuffed “infrastructure” bill, and Republicans’ lame answers to Democrats’ demands for socialized college inspire no confidence, either.
This is unacceptable. It is not the behavior of a party ready to govern. When governing was possible, Republicans diddled. They appear to have no big ideas for future governance, either. Democrats’ unhinged circus is a just punishment for Republicans’ failure to deserve majority votes. It’s long past time for the GOP to figure out what they’re going to do about our nation’s serious problems if they ever win again, and develop the political courage to advance those ideas under fire.","['anti-vaxxers', 'QAnon', 'impervious']"
"Left-wing Christians declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/woman-who-killed-baby-over-maternity-leave-proves-welfare-wont-fix-abortion/?fbclid=IwAR2SBE3O9KtpsqJvMCIeSlk4Zeqn3oexJevVoXUhDpKszW_VHrTEMBiewaw,federalist,abortion,right,17.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”
This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.
This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.
The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.
Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.
The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”
This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.
This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.
I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.
Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.
In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.
Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.
Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.
It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.","['Left-wing', 'generous', 'welfare', 'state', 'cradle-to-grave']"
"The devil is in the details, however, since—while some charter schools are effective in achieving student success—others have been examples of cronyism and corruption as a result of arrangements between politicians and private businesses.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/01/18/jeb-calls-education-a-civil-rights-issue-no-mention-of-his-support-for-common-core/,breitbart,student-debt,right,17.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush announced his “budget neutral” education plan on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, as he also lamented income inequality, asserted that education is a “civil rights issue,” and advocated for more opportunities for pre-K education for children of low-income families.
At the same time, while Bush invoked the talking points of the Common Core state standards—the federally-funded education reform that he championed for years—he failed to mention it by name in his plan.
In his “Blueprint for a 21st Century American Education System”—posted on Medium—Bush writes:
Too many low-income students start kindergarten already years behind their more affluent counterparts. Only one-third of students graduate high school prepared for college or a good career. And our higher education system has become too expensive for many Americans to afford. To achieve equal opportunity and increased economic growth, we must provide every child the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the increasingly competitive 21st century global economy.
“As the nation honors Dr. Martin Luther King and his legacy today, I firmly believe that ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time,” he said, pointing out that his plan requires “a complete overhaul of a system from one that serves bureaucracies to one that serves the needs of families and students…”
Though Bush urged states to sign on to the Common Core standards in exchange for a shot at federal stimulus dollars and waivers from the onerous No Child Left Behind federal law, the founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE) says his education plan is built on “four conservative principles”:
1) education decisions should be made as close to the student as possible 2) choice of all kinds should be expanded 3) transparency is essential to accountability 4) innovation requires flexibility
During the years Bush was campaigning for Common Core, he repeated the talking points that the reform was “state-led,” and that local school districts could still set their own curriculum, even though the Common Core-aligned tests—developed by federally-funded test consortia—would determine the curriculum since both students and teachers would be evaluated based on students’ performance on Common Core tests.
Bush writes he will “leverage the limited role of the federal government to improve all schools” through an expansion of school choice by doubling support for charter schools, strengthening the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program—which is a school voucher system—and allowing federal dollars to follow the child—also known as “portability.”
The devil is in the details, however, since—while some charter schools are effective in achieving student success—others have been examples of cronyism and corruption as a result of arrangements between politicians and private businesses. And while “portability”—i.e., when taxpayer funds, known as a “voucher,” for a child’s public education follows a child to the private school of his or her choice—sounds “conservative,” the reality is that it is not only the money that follows along with the child, but also increased government regulation. For some years now, conservative and libertarian education policy experts have warned against voucher systems in favor, instead, of tax-credit scholarships and education savings accounts, which are less likely to drag the regulations and mandates of government schools into the private arena.
Ironically, Bush claims to want to tamp down on federal intrusion in academic standards, curriculum or content.
“Right now, too many regulations drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources,” he writes. “We need to give states the flexibility to reform and innovate to meet the unique needs of their students.”
“Portability,” through vouchers, however, could bring further regulations into private and religious schools. And with Bush’s past advocacy for Common Core, conservatives will find it hard to envision him as a presidential candidate who would be fighting for less regulation.
Teachers’ unions and liberals in general, on the other hand, are against school choice and vouchers for different reasons—mostly informed by their desire to keep federal funding flowing into public schools and public school teacher jobs.
Bush writes he hopes to drive down college costs by creating “state databases so every student can see the average unemployment rate, earnings, graduation rates and debt repayment rate of programs they are considering.”
“We need students to be able to judge the cost and quality of programs so they can make better choices and hold schools accountable,” the GOP contender writes, and—once again—while the idea sounds like it would create a sense of competitiveness among colleges and universities, the creation of “state databases” is likely to be a concern for many parents that their children’s private data will be part of the mix.
For prospective college students, Bush plans to stem student loan debt by giving all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit through an education savings account to pay for college and career training.
“For every $10,000 spent, students would repay 1 percent of their income for 25 years,” Bush proposes, and also includes a plan for those in debt now to allow that debt to be “discharged in bankruptcy,” with the possibility of extended repayment periods.
“I know what needs to be done,” Bush asserts. “As governor of Florida, I increased student achievement across the board, particularly for those most at risk, and as president, I will do the same.”","['cronyism', 'corruption']"
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,17.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.

Coyne Schofield, 26, joined McGuire for NBC Sports Network’s “Wednesday Night Hockey” pregame coverage, and during the broadcast, McGuire, 57, appeared to attempt to coach Coyne Schofield.
NFL, NBA AND MLB AROUND TO SPORTS BETTING AS LEAGUES COULD WIN BIG
“So Tampa’s going to be on your left, Pittsburgh’s going to be on your right,” McGuire pointed out. “What are you expecting out of this game? We’re paying you to be an analyst, not to be a fan tonight!”
Coyne Schofield, of course, is a professional ice hockey player who plays for the Minnesota Whitecaps of the National Women’s Hockey League -- aside from helping to nab that gold medal for the U.S. last February. She also studied communications at Northeastern University.
She replied to McGuire that she was “excited to the start tonight.”
He also came under fire later for another comment he made to Coyne Schofield.
The analysts were talking about the game becoming intense, likening it to the U.S.-Canada game during the 2018 Olympics.
“Except I had a cage on for that one,” she replied.
“I’ll be your cage tonight, how’s that?” McGuire replied.

Social media users were quick to point out the interactions and slammed McGuire for appearing to undermine Coyne Schofield’s hockey skills.
“I’ve become immune to Pierre McGuire’s goofiness over the years. But treating an Olympic winner and accomplished hockey veteran like she’s a fan who won a contest is downright wrong and insulting,” one user tweeted.
“He might as well have continued to tell her ‘this sport is called hockey … this is called a puck,” another tweet read.
On Thursday, Coyne Schofield tweeted that she had a great time working as an analyst on Wednesday night.
“What an unforgettable night to cap off this incredible week,” she wrote. “Thank you NBC Sports for the opportunity to be an analyst on [Wednesday Night Hockey] alongside the best linemates in the business. I had SO much fun! I’m so excited to continue to learn & grow in this role! Thanks for all the support!”
Later on Thursday, Coyne Schofield released a lengthy statement regarding McGuire.
""I've known Pierre McGuire for years,"" Coyne Schofield wrote. ""I know he respects me as a hockey player, a woman, and a friend and that is why I didn't think twice about our on-air exchange when it happened,"" she wrote.
She said McGuire was excited for her and knows he ""doesn't question"" her knowledge of hockey.

This time, she’s got a righteous burn for President Trump, imagining how John F. Kennedy would have sounded had he written a letter to former Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev along the lines of Trump’s recent letter to Turkish President Recep Erdogan.
Hillary’s letter is painful. It’s riddled with stilted speech and a weak attempt to use swear words like that other future has-been who at least can kind of skateboard and pretend to air drum. Whether or not you agreed with Trump’s approach, at least his fondness for cuss words is authentic, something Hilldog struggles with.
She doesn’t do hep cat well, nor does she seem to hang loose very often. But she also doesn’t seem poised to go gently into that good night, so someone should help her. Given that she has about as much chance of occupying higher office at this point as I do, it might as well be me.
I am not in Hillary’s target market, which I assume is those young whippersnappers that the Democrats are always talking about. I do, however, have a better understanding of them than she does. They don’t want focus group messaging, stripped of all meaning. They don’t want lame jokes about “The Soviet Bunion,” which doesn’t even remotely work because union and bunion don’t rhyme. They don’t want “hugs.” They want that aforementioned authenticity. Hillary, you can deliver that. You just have to embrace your roots.
While I’m on record as being less than a huge fan of the boomers, I do understand them. Hilldog, you understand them, too, at least the ones you don’t consider deplorable. To really make the most of your presence on the computer, you need to lean in to that. Then, and only then, will your dreams of raging against the dying of the light come true. To that end, here are some suggestions.
Do You Know How Much Less That Used to Cost?
Did you know that it only cost around 70 cents to go to a movie in 1962? In 2019, it’s $9! That’s ridiculous. It’s time for someone to remind us of the glory days of Camelot, and Camelot, and why the world was so much better 60 years ago.
What are Trump and the Republicans doing to bring back those halcyon days? Nothing, that’s what. Remind people to not even get you started on a cup of coffee, a gallon of gas, or a newspaper.
Regarding Movies
“Forrest Gump” is the greatest movie ever made, full stop. Reference it whenever possible. Pepper your social media posts with quotes like “Life is like a box of chocolates: you never know which ones the Russians are going to give you” and “Run, Hillary! Run!” Elizabeth Warren is just a warmed-over version of you. Remember, this is about authenticity. Don’t make the voters settle for second best.
Self-Checkout Grocery Shopping
Remember when Little Timmy used to ring up and bag your groceries? Not only would he handle everything, he did it right, not smashing your bread at the bottom of the bag. Now, you have to scan and bag them yourself, trying to avoid crushing your various delicate purchases. And you don’t even get an employee discount for doing all the work yourself. Moreover, it’s hard to write a check to pay for them.
These are issues that speak to people. Do remind them that basket of groceries is way more expensive. Don’t remind them that their checks get processed by those blasted computers, just like the cards.
Speaking of Computers
Why are they so complicated to use and hard to clean? They never work like they’re supposed to, especially when you’re trying to order an iced tea to be delivered from the kitchen to your study. And who decided we should carry them around in our pockets? Phones are supposed to be tethered to the wall. A rant about these tribulations would be both relevant and timely.
Remember Simple, Elegant Pleasures
There was a time we appreciated gathering around a formal table for a meal, enjoying classic things like congealed salads. Now, burgers and fries are considered appropriate. This is just wrong.
Much like air travel, modern life should be reminiscent of a time when the rubes weren’t allowed to enjoy the finer things. Remember that Forrest said, “The best thing about visiting the president is the food! Now, since it was all free, and I wasn’t hungry but thirsty, I must’ve drank me 15 Dr. Peppers.” Actually, maybe skip that one. The focus group suggests it might sound supportive of the fast-food feast Trump served Clemson when it won the national championship.
Hill, you may not be in the race—yet—but that doesn’t mean your voice isn’t crucial to success in 2020, whoever’s success it is. The world is waiting to hear what you have to say on a variety of issues, both big and small. Given your ability to connect with voters, it’s incumbent on you, even if you’re not the incumbent, to use it. But you have to embrace your roots.
The way to do so is to be a boomer. Be the biggest boomer you can be. Bring forth memories of happier days, of missile crises, stagflation, and [REDACTED]. As the once-popular poster of the kitten hanging from a wire reminded us, “Hang in there.” (Note: Remember to share that poster on Instagram. Make inspirational messages memes again!) And remember, as Mama Gump said, “You’ve got to put the past behind you before you can move on.”
Actually, maybe “Forrest Gump” isn’t the best lodestar for this new project, but remember, it actually experienced success, so just massage the message as needed. You have our, well, not support, but you do have our encouragement. We’ll be waiting on you to spam us with messages on Facebook after your account gets hacked, again.","['righteous', 'burn', 'gay', 'frogs', 'conspiracies', 'gracefully']"

While President Trump visited the southern border Thursday, Democratic darling Beto O’Rourke visited the dentist — posting a bizarre video showing him getting a mouth-wide-open cleaning in order to highlight the story of his dental hygienist’s upbringing in El Paso.
With dental tools jammed into either side of his mouth, O’Rourke introduced his dental hygienist as part of his Instagram story “series” on “people of the border.”
“Um, so I’m here at the dentist and we’re going to continue our series on the people of the border. I’m here with Diana, my dental hygienist,” O’Rourke slurred. “Um, Diana is going to tell us a little bit about growing up in El Paso.”
Diana, who was born in El Paso, said her mother was from a small town in Mexico, and her father was a U.S. citizen.
“My mom was a permanent resident when she was studying to become a citizen,” Diana said, with a dental mask and goggles covering her face. “The neighborhood really helped her out … so she could learn more English and that way she would be able to pass her citizenship.”
She added: “The entire neighborhood was there when she did and it was wonderful.”
O’Rourke, who led the questioning from the dentist chair, asked what it was like growing up along the border.

“It’s a beautiful community. We all support each other and love each other but it’s not what everyone thinks badly of us,” she said. “It’s actually a wonderful place to live and grow up.”
O’Rourke, who is weighing a potential 2020 presidential bid after his loss to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in one of last year's highest-profile midterm contests, posted his video as the president was heading to McAllen, Texas to visit the border on day 20 of the partial federal government shutdown.

Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.","['vision', 'without', 'clear']"
President Donald Trump used the occasion to again voice skepticism about climate change.,https://www.breitbart.com/news/dangerous-arctic-chill-sweeps-over-us-midwest/,breitbart,environment,right,18.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Chicago (AFP) – The polar vortex is here — tens of millions of people in the United States braced Tuesday for a deep arctic chill, which authorities say could be life-threatening.
Sub-zero temperatures already blanketing parts of Canada were already sweeping across the US Midwest and towards the East Coast.
The big chill in the Midwest came on the heels of a major storm that dumped up to a foot of snow (30 centimeters) on the region over the weekend — and reportedly claimed at least two lives so far.
“We need everyone to do your part and make sure you and your families are prepared,” said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.
Companies told their workers to stay home. Schools were closed. Hundreds of flights were canceled.
Temperatures in almost a dozen states stretching more than 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) from the Dakotas to Ohio were forecast to be the coldest in a generation, if not on record.
“One of the coldest arctic air mass intrusions in recent memory is surging south into the Upper Midwest before spreading across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country,” the National Weather Service said.
“Expect frigid temperatures, bitterly cold and life-threatening wind chills, likely leading to widespread record lows and low maximum temperatures from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.”
The culprit? A swirl of arctic air that broke away from the polar vortex that usually encircles the North Pole.
The National Weather Service forecast temperatures between -10 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 to -40 Celsius) by Wednesday across the Midwest, with wind chills making it seem as cold as -65 degrees Fahrenheit in one area of Minnesota.
Chicago, America’s third largest city, was expected to be colder than parts of Antarctica.
Authorities in Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin put emergency measures in place to handle the frigid weather.
– Frostbite warnings –
Americans were asked to stay home if possible Wednesday, when temperatures were expected to be at their coldest.
Scores of schools, businesses and government agencies announced closures in multiple states.
“People exposed to extreme cold are susceptible to frostbite in a matter of minutes,” warned the NWS.
Lawrence Gottlieb of the University of Chicago Medical Center said the threat was significant “when temps fall below zero, especially when there is a strong wind.”
Some 160 warming centers were opened in Chicago, where temperatures could potentially equal or exceed the all-time record of -27 degrees Fahrenheit. With the wind chill, it would feel like -40 or -50, officials said.
“They are life-threatening conditions and temperatures,” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told a news conference.
In Minneapolis, officials allowed residents to stay on public buses and trains for warmth.
– Snow storm –
In the northeastern and southern United States, snow was falling.
A cold emergency was declared in the US capital Washington, with additional services put on for the homeless.
In the southern city of Atlanta, some 300 flights were canceled Tuesday, and more than 400 were canceled in Chicago, a major regional hub for US airlines.
In Canada, the icy temperatures — stretching from Manitoba in the western Prairies region to the Atlantic seaboard — prompted a rare “hazardous” cold warning from the government.
Environment Canada reported record-breaking snowfall at the Ottawa airport, where some 50 flights were canceled, with an accumulation of nearly a meter (more than three feet).
An additional 200 flights were canceled at Toronto’s airport.
– Global warming? –
Scientists say climate change is causing more extreme weather, and one theory for polar vortex chills is that arctic air currents usually trapped around the North Pole are weakened and dislodged by a warming climate.
President Donald Trump used the occasion to again voice skepticism about climate change, tweeting: “What the hell is going on with Global Waming? (sic) Please come back fast, we need you!”
But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates NWS, tweeted, “Winter storms don’t prove that global warming isn’t happening,” with a link to a 2015 explanatory article.","['skepticism', 'voice']"
"The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children…",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/27/vaccine-mandates-put-vulnerable-peoples-health-lives-risk/,federalist,vaccines,right,18.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Several years ago, I began to recognize treadmills. Not the ones at the gym—I’m talking about lifestyle treadmills: the paths we take in life based upon well-established social and institutional norms. These are the paths we rarely question because, well, “everyone does it.”
We stepped off the public education treadmill in 2011, when we began homeschooling. We exited the convenience treadmill a few years later when we moved from an established neighborhood to a farm in a small town 25 miles away. And that move got us off our next treadmill.
Once we lived miles from our regular physicians and weren’t required to be “current” on vaccinations, we simply didn’t make doctors’ appointments. Other than a rotten appendix, none of us have been sick enough in the five years since our move to warrant a visit, but I digress.
Health Care Has Become a Treadmill
I was born in 1962, just seven years after Jonas Salk’s discovery became available for public use—a time which could be referred to as the “decade of vaccines.”
My parents told stories of swimming pool hysteria, iron lungs, and classmates who suffered the effects of polio. Measles was killing children polio wasn’t, rubella was causing miscarriages and birth defects, and the mumps vaccine had just been improved. My sister and I were vaccinated for them all individually before the combined MMR vaccine came to market in the 1970s, and my parents were very grateful for that opportunity.
The peace of mind brought by vaccine science and antibiotics elevated the practice of medicine. If you got sick, you went to the doctor. You received some kind of pill you took until you felt better, no matter how many were left in the bottle (see antibiotic resistance).
Homeopathic remedies began to look like more like witchcraft, compared with the success and ease of modern medicine. It was easier to take prescription medications than to ride out their inconveniences or research other methods of treatment.
But today, the pendulum is swinging back. With Obamacare and the associated gargantuan rise in health care costs, many citizens are being forced to pay attention to their personal health, contributing to a rise in alternative medicine. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, nearly 40 percent of the US adult population used some kind of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in 2008, including diet-based therapies, massage or acupuncture, and/or natural products and supplements such as herbs and essential oils.
Is it unbelievable then, that parents would begin to question the safety, efficacy and necessity of their child’s vaccinations as well?
Why Would Anyone Question Vaccines?
When my biological kids were born (and after our adopted children became American citizens and Oklahoma residents), their pediatrician gave them the standard CDC vaccination protocol corresponding to their year of birth (2002–2004). Though the large number of syringes on the nurse’s tray being emptied into chunky little thighs and arms made me nervous—I knew of the possibility for vaccine injury—I never really questioned the process. I had carefully interviewed the physician who would be their pediatrician. I believed I had done my due diligence.
Every year, the kids had their well-baby visits and were given booster vaccinations as necessary.
Once school aged, in order to be enrolled in their zip-code-assigned public school, state law required them to be current on their vaccination schedule. This included vaccines for chicken pox (Varicella), Hepatitis A and B.
Although I was conditioned to accept the Polio, MMR, and DPT vaccines, these additions had always frustrated me. From 1997 to 1999, I was employed as an epidemiologist with the Oklahoma State Department of Health. During that time, the state was becoming convinced of the need to require Varicella and Hep A vaccinations for children.
We epidemiologists (in charge of studying disease outbreaks) often discussed the very rare percentages of children and/or adults experiencing severe reactions from either Varicella or Hep A (mainly the immunocompromised and elderly), and it made little sense to me that the state should suddenly decide to force vaccinations for these diseases on children as a necessity to attend school.
It still doesn’t—and here’s why.
Hepatitis A
The OSDH School Vaccination sheet for parents explains that about 100 people a year die from hepatitis A, and that some infected persons may not even have symptoms of the disease. The population of the United States is over 324 million. Thus, the instance of death of Hepatitis A in the United States is 0.00000031 or 0.000031% of the total population. Does that warrant a vaccine?
Chicken Pox
We’re told chicken pox is “usually mild, but it can lead to severe skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), and even death”. We’re not given the instance in the population, but several sources confirm an average of 100 chicken pox deaths before 1995 when the vaccine was introduced. Once again, we are forcing a vaccine on parents for a disease significant for three-hundred thousandths of the population?
Relatedly, the CDC has confirmed a near doubling of the incidence of shingles since 1993 (shingles is a variant of the chicken pox virus). A current theory is that, because most children no longer get chicken pox, their parents no longer get an immunological boost from the disease and their immune system ‘forgets’ how to fight it. For anyone with shingles – this is a significant issue.
Hepatitis B
Hep B symptoms are usually mild. Chronic liver infection can occur, but the older the person is at the time of infection, the less likely that risk.
According to the National Vaccine Information Center, Hep B is neither common in the US, nor highly contagious. But because it can be spread from mothers infected by IV drug use or sexual contact to their babies, the CDC advised it should be given to ALL babies/children in the US beginning in 1991.
There have been 11,052 serious adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in connection with Hep B vaccines since 1990 – a disease that only affects a subset of the total population. Why would this vaccine be mandated for school children when only those within a specific subset of the population are affected—especially in light of the recorded associated vaccine injuries?
Is it because it’s easier to remove an individual’s right to make healthcare choice than take CDC and/or state Epidemiologists away from number crunching at their computers and put them into the field to actually study disease process?
There’s a Lot of Nuance to This Topic
In a recent Federalist article—“No, Anti-Vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr. Won’t Be Trump’s ‘Vaccine Czar’”—author Julie Kelly states that “collective alarm” was raised as then-President-elect Trump met with RFK Jr. She continues, “The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children…”
It’s possible this writer doesn’t know that in 1995, the CDC recommended approximately 20 doses of 5 vaccinations from birth to 18 years of age, but by 2013, that number had expanded to 50 doses of 14 vaccinations from birth to 18.
That doesn’t seem a bit much—especially for small children with new and developing immune systems? Especially when the newest recommendations contain vaccinations for illnesses that are neither highly infectious, nor have a high mortality rate?
I’ve already discussed three of those vaccines. But let’s take a couple more: the HPV and Gardasil vaccine, and the meningitis vaccine.
HPV/Gardasil
According to the CDC, 6.2 million new sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) cases are identified each year. Of all cases, 70 percent clear within a year. Ninety percent clear within two. Apparently, an avoidance of casual sex would solve the problem of initial infection—as would monogamous sex. In addition, regular yearly PAP smears would alleviate cancer risk.
VAERS reports 37,474 vaccine reactions to Gardasil since September 2015, including 209 deaths.
Though a cervical cancer survivor, I would NEVER recommend HPV vaccination to anyone, including my own daughters, based on both the etiology of the disease and the vaccination risk.
Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the brain which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Though symptoms for all these variants are similar, four vaccines are currently used to combat bacterial meningitis, commonly called meningococcal disease. Meningitis is passed via saliva primarily and can be treated by antibiotics if identified quickly, but can be physically debilitating or deadly if not treated soon enough.
According to the CDC, “Today, meningococcal disease is at a historic low in the United States. Rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States since the 1990s, with much of the decline seen before the routine use of meningococcal vaccines” (emphasis added).
In 2013, there were only 550 total meningococcal cases. The CDC reports 8,594 VAERS events in conjunction with vaccine MenACWY-D between 2005 and 2011, including 24 deaths and 284 VAERS events with MenACWY-CRM, including one death.
Please note the fact that while there are only approximately 550 cases per year, there have been 1,480 vaccine events per year. Additional risk is apparent when HPV and Meningococcal vaccines are administered together.
Drug interaction is a known issue—it’s the reason doctors must know the medications and supplements their patients are taking before they write them a prescription.
Is it really so outrageous to believe that the possible combinations from giving a child 50 doses of 14 different vaccines couldn’t cause health issues? Just the list of contraindications for today’s vaccines should generate at least some level of deep thought before offering up that thigh, arm, or hip to a syringe.
Fearmongering Doesn’t Make Responsible Citizens
Across the United States, legislators are attempting to pass laws forcing parents to vaccinate their children and/or removing existing exemptions from current vaccine laws. Citing “public safety,” law makers such as Oklahoma’s state Sen. Irvin Yen seek to remove parental choice in vaccination based on the argument that diseases once eradicated—such as polio—will return.
Like Yen, author Kelly blames “anti-vaccine activism” for outbreaks of measles and whooping cough, yet neither Kelly nor Yen cite their reasoning.
Curiously, both Kelly and Yen seem unaware of the influx of undocumented immigrants pouring into this country daily from countries with very low vaccination rates and high instances of diseases such as whooping cough and mumps. In fact, the CDC studies rates of disease in incoming legal immigrants and reported in 2009, that 104,954 immigrants were identified as having a “medical condition” to include tuberculosis, and then admitted “the majority of immigrant records (approximately 400K) are not collected.”
Parents Aren’t Solely Responsible for Outbreaks
A recent mumps outbreak in Oklahoma spanned 8 counties, yet the highest rates of illness (66 percent) were in the vaccinated population. No vaccine confers 100 percent disease immunity, and mumps vaccine is only 88 percent effective after two doses, leaving 12 percent of the population at risk following disease exposure. Though the origination of the outbreak is unknown, the Arkansas Department of Health also reported nearly 100 confirmed cases—an indication of interstate mobility.
The median age in this outbreak was 16. Because adults often have little immunity from diseases vaccinated against in childhood, this significant part of the population can also contract and/or pass illness.
In addition, many vaccines given today contain live virus. Anyone taking a live virus vaccine can ‘shed’ the disease to others as their immune system ramps up to create antibodies against the disease. Unvaccinated persons in physical contact with a shedding vaccinated person can become ill.
Considering these factors, blaming parents whose children didn’t take the MMR for this—or any—mumps outbreak simply doesn’t add up.
Not Anti-Vax, But Pro-Informed Consent
Let me be clear. I believe parents in the United States should protect the health of their children by vaccinating them against highly infectious diseases with high mortality and/or morbidity rates. Vaccinations against polio, whooping cough, measles, diphtheria, and rubella have prevented untold thousands of deaths and health complications in this country over the decades and this fact is nothing to—excuse the term—“sneeze at.”
That said, every physician or health department responsible for vaccinating children should provide parents with all the facts about every vaccine before a needle pierces skin. Few do, and that raises a red flag. Why shouldn’t parents receive all information necessary to make an informed decision about their child’s health?
Today’s parents are getting savvy. They’re beginning to find that government doesn’t have all the answers. They don’t want half-baked “experts” telling them what to do. Let’s face it— if the USDA created the food pyramid to help out farm concerns, and the CDC bought into it, what does that say about the government’s ability to use science independently? Why not exercise some healthy skepticism about CDC vaccine recommendations?
Strident physicians and lawmakers unwilling to address concerns about vaccine safety don’t create public trust—especially when rampant anecdotal (and factual) information is easily found on the internet.
State health departments and legislators who sneer at parental concerns and call for vaccination mandates erode parents’ trust. That makes them less likely to vaccinate, which in turn makes government officials push vaccines all the more. This vicious cycle is good for no one.","['well-deserved', 'dangerous', 'comments']"
" While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. ",https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2015/07/31/mark-levins-plunder-and-deceit-takes-fight-to-millenial-generation/,breitbart,student-debt,right,19.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In Liberty and Tyranny, iconic syndicated radio host Mark Levin laid out the stakes of the conflict between Constitutional Americanism and the forces of the statists—those who would see governmental power maximized in order to achieve the chimerical equality sought by the American left. In Ameritopia, he exposed the utopianism underlying the tyranny of the left, a utopianism with roots running back centuries. In The Liberty Amendments, Levin proposed constitutional amendments designed to rollback the perversions of the Constitution foisted upon Americans by those utopian statists.
Now, in his elegant and moving new book, Plunder and Deceit, Levin takes his message to the next generation. While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll. He wants young Americans to know the threats to their future, and he wants them to know those threats now—and he wants their parents to see the errors of their ways before it’s too late.
Levin’s Plunder and Deceit opens with a question not for young Americans but for their parents: “Can we simultaneously love our children but betray their generation and generations yet born?” he asks. The answer, Levin says, is no. We can pretend to ourselves that politics have no importance to the lives of our children, even as we engage as good parents. But that isn’t love, it’s moral cowardice:
To embrace the moral order as parents nurturing their children, yet to abandon the moral order as members of the ruling generation, thereby contributing to predictably deleterious public policies with prospectively calamitous outcomes, is a decadence that leads to unstable and potentially oppressive or even tyrannical contradictions which, in the end, degrade and disassemble the civil society and consume their children’s generation and generations beyond.
Meanwhile, young people are being seduced by utopian idealism at the expense of eternal values:
By cultivating agitation and balkanization almost nothing about the civil society is said to be true, right, or lasting and, therefore, worth preserving and perpetuating. Instead, much uproar is generated in the quest for utopian abstractions and societal transformation – the fundamental cause around which younger people have been encouraged and trained to rally, to their detriment and the jeopardy of subsequent generations, and to the benefit of the statist.
How do we counter the dual trends of parental abdication and youthful utopianism? Levin suggests truth as the weapon and then, armed with truth, resistance.
Levin begins his tome by writing about the crushing debt burden that young people will carry all of their lives thanks to the profligacy of their parents. That debt will take its toll in the form of rising interest rates, less investment, and a dramatically slowing economy. Debt, Levin writes, is a moral problem, not merely an economic one: “Stealing from the future does not establish the utopia promised by the statists. It is the rising generation’s grave moral failure.”
Levin extends that sort of clarity to his examinations of Social Security (“economically and fiscally irrational and irresponsible,” a program destined to take down “the older recipients and the younger payers alike”); Medicare and Obamacare (“simultaneously expanding and imploding”); modern American education (“administrators and educational bureaucrats, labor unions, tenured educators, improvident construction projects, and statist indoctrination”); immigration (“immigration without assimilation and Americanization undercuts the civil society as ethnic, racial and religious groups self-segregate”); climate change (“hysterical doomsday predictions of environmental Armageddon, which can only be avoided by the imposition of [environmentalists’] severe, ideologically driven agenda”); minimum wage (“the consequences… include pervasive unemployment and the lack of important job experience”); national security (“too many younger people are inattentive to or nonplussed about – or in rancorous opposition to – the development and maintenance” of strong national defense).
Finally, Levin comes to the Constitution. The bedrock document upon which the nation was founded has taken a heavy beating from President Obama and statists for decades; Levin looks to it as a guidebook from our current predicament rather than a beloved relic to be worshipped as a museum piece. The Constitution, Levin writes, “provides the governing order of a republic intended to protect the individual’s liberty from a tyrannical centralized authority and, conversely, the anarchy of mob rule.” But the document requires an informed citizenry to utilize it: “The citizenry must be alert and resolute and ensure that those who hold high office uphold the rules of governance.”
The people, however, have failed in their duty to uphold the Constitution, Levin says. Levin poses the battle as one between defenders of the Constitutional republic and statists informed by the spirit of Marx. And the Marxists are winning, gradually reducing the American people to a state of soul-sucking apathy and servitude.
Levin, rightly, blames Congress, which was supposed to be the lawmaking branch. His stunning comparison between the number of pages of federal regulations for 2014 (79,066) and number of actual regulations (3,541) versus the number of laws passed by Congress (129) demonstrates the increased power of the executive branch at the expense of the legislature. The statist vision is coming to pass in real time. And if the members of the younger generation continue to allow statists to plunder and deceive them, “they will commit future generations to an even more miserable plight.”
Levin responds to that threat by calling for a “new civil rights movement,” focused on the complete overhaul of education, immigration policy, Medicare and Obamacare, and all the rest. The new civil rights movement, says Levin, must “speak out, challenge, debate, rally, and protest. It must become a force for respectful and prudential activism. And when circumstances are unjust or oppressive, it must even disobey – but in a civil and peaceful way, unlike the violent and destructive rage of the 1960s radical underground movement and its modern adherents.”
“The right cause,” Levin concludes, “now is nothing short of self-preservation.” This is a battle for our lies and the lives of our children. It’s time to engage.

“Immigration, whether legal or illegal, expands the labor force and changes its composition, leading to increases in total economic output,” said the non-partisan report, titled “The Foreign-Born Population and Its Effects on the U.S. Economy and the Federal Budget—An Overview.”
But this national expansion does “not necessarily [deliver] to increases in output per capita,” or income per person, the report said:
For example, business leaders say the nation’s enormous population of immigrants has expanded the nation’s workforce, increased consumption, and driven up housing prices. But that inflow has also shrunk the wages of less-educated Americans, the report said:
Among people with less education, a large percentage are foreign born. Consequently, immigration has exerted downward pressure on the wages of relatively low-skilled workers who are already in the country, regardless of their birthplace.
The CBO report contradicts business claims that a bigger economy ensures bigger wages for everyone.
More ominously, the report also suggests that the American middle-class — including millions of young college graduates — may suffer a similar economic disaster if immigration policy is shifted to raise the inflow of foreign college graduates. The report says:
The effects of immigration on wages depend on the characteristics of the immigrants. To the extent that newly arrived workers have abilities similar to those of workers already in the country, immigration would have a negative effect on wages.
Many business advocates in Washington are calling for a dramatic increase in “high-skilled immigration” — meaning foreign college graduates who would compete for the same jobs as American college graduates. For example, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is trying to pass his S.386 bill that offers the prize of renewable work-permits — and eventual citizenship — to an unlimited number of foreign graduates.
Each year, up to 120,000 foreign graduates — and their spouses and children — can get green cards via their employer’s sponsorship, even as perhaps 800,000 Americans graduate from college with skilled degrees.
But Lee’s bill creates a new legal status called “Early Adjustment.” This status would allow an uncapped number of college graduate migrants to apply for renewable work permits long before they can get a green card to become a legal immigrant and citizen.
Existing law allows an uncapped number of foreigners to legally get short-term work permits and jobs after enrolling in U.S. colleges. The migrants can get jobs by first paying tuition to a university, and then getting short-term work permits via the uncapped “Curricular Practical Training” and the “Optional Practical Training” programs. These workers must leave the United States after a few years until they enroll themselves in work permit programs.
But Lee’s bill would remove any caps on this foreign worker population by allowing an unlimited number of foreign workers to get “Early Adjustment” status from their employers.

Many migrants already use the CPT and OPT work permits to get jobs and to also compete for entry into the H-1B visa worker program. Once in the H-1B program — which accepts 85,000 new workers each year — many of the migrants also ask their employers to sponsor them for green cards.
The sponsorship allows them to stay working in the United States until they eventually get their valuable green card, long after their temporary visas have expired. Congress has not set an annual limit on the number of visa workers who can be sponsored for green cards, so the resident population of permanent “temporary workers” is growing fast — and is helping to suppress wages for American graduates.
Roughly 1.5 million foreign visa workers hold white-collar jobs throughout the U.S. economy. This number includes at least 750,000 Indians who are allowed to work via the supposedly temporary CPT, OPT, L-1, and H-1B visa programs. Roughly 300,000 of these Indians — plus 300,000 family members — are being allowed to stay in the United States because they asked their employers to sponsor them for green cards.
The CBO report shows that immigrants comprise roughly 40 percent of the population of people who did not graduate from high school — and that immigrants already comprise roughly 20 percent of all people with a “graduate degree.”
The 20 percent share likely would quickly rise if the Senate approves Lee’s S.386 plan — and that rise could sharply reduce salaries for American college graduates.
“Wage trends over the past half-century suggest that a 10 percent increase in the number of workers with a particular set of skills probably lowers the wage of that group by at least 3 percent” as the extra workers compete for jobs, says George Borjas, a labor economist at Harvard. That extra labor does expand the economy — but that expansion is dwarfed by the transfer of the wage reductions to investors, he wrote in 2016:
I estimate the current “immigration surplus”—the net increase in the total wealth of the native population—to be about $50 billion annually. But behind that calculation is a much larger shift from one group of Americans to another: The total wealth redistribution from the native losers to the native winners [mostly employers] is enormous, roughly a half-trillion dollars a year.
“In low-skilled occupations, a one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an individual’s occupation reduces wages by [0].8 percent,” said a 1998 report by the Center for Immigration Studies.
A 2013 CBO report predicted that the 2013 “Gang of Eight” amnesty and immigration bill would reduce the share of income that goes to wage earners and increase the share that goes to investors. “Because the bill would increase the rate of growth of the labor force, average wages would be held down in the first decade after enactment,” the CBO report said.
But all that cheap labor would boost corporate profits and spike the stock market, the report said. “The rate of return on capital would be higher [than on labor] under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades,” says the report, titled “The Economic Impact of S. 744.”
Business leaders sometimes admit that an extra supply of workers forces down wages. “If you have ten people for every job, you’re not going to have a drive [up] in wages,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue told Breitbart News on January 9. But “if you have five people for every ten jobs, wages are going to go up.”",['enormous']

Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.",['Luckily']

Hillary’s letter is painful. It’s riddled with stilted speech and a weak attempt to use swear words like that other future has-been who at least can kind of skateboard and pretend to air drum. Whether or not you agreed with Trump’s approach, at least his fondness for cuss words is authentic, something Hilldog struggles with.
She doesn’t do hep cat well, nor does she seem to hang loose very often. But she also doesn’t seem poised to go gently into that good night, so someone should help her. Given that she has about as much chance of occupying higher office at this point as I do, it might as well be me.
I am not in Hillary’s target market, which I assume is those young whippersnappers that the Democrats are always talking about. I do, however, have a better understanding of them than she does. They don’t want focus group messaging, stripped of all meaning. They don’t want lame jokes about “The Soviet Bunion,” which doesn’t even remotely work because union and bunion don’t rhyme. They don’t want “hugs.” They want that aforementioned authenticity. Hillary, you can deliver that. You just have to embrace your roots.
While I’m on record as being less than a huge fan of the boomers, I do understand them. Hilldog, you understand them, too, at least the ones you don’t consider deplorable. To really make the most of your presence on the computer, you need to lean in to that. Then, and only then, will your dreams of raging against the dying of the light come true. To that end, here are some suggestions.
Do You Know How Much Less That Used to Cost?
Did you know that it only cost around 70 cents to go to a movie in 1962? In 2019, it’s $9! That’s ridiculous. It’s time for someone to remind us of the glory days of Camelot, and Camelot, and why the world was so much better 60 years ago.
What are Trump and the Republicans doing to bring back those halcyon days? Nothing, that’s what. Remind people to not even get you started on a cup of coffee, a gallon of gas, or a newspaper.
Regarding Movies
“Forrest Gump” is the greatest movie ever made, full stop. Reference it whenever possible. Pepper your social media posts with quotes like “Life is like a box of chocolates: you never know which ones the Russians are going to give you” and “Run, Hillary! Run!” Elizabeth Warren is just a warmed-over version of you. Remember, this is about authenticity. Don’t make the voters settle for second best.
Self-Checkout Grocery Shopping
Remember when Little Timmy used to ring up and bag your groceries? Not only would he handle everything, he did it right, not smashing your bread at the bottom of the bag. Now, you have to scan and bag them yourself, trying to avoid crushing your various delicate purchases. And you don’t even get an employee discount for doing all the work yourself. Moreover, it’s hard to write a check to pay for them.
These are issues that speak to people. Do remind them that basket of groceries is way more expensive. Don’t remind them that their checks get processed by those blasted computers, just like the cards.
Speaking of Computers
Why are they so complicated to use and hard to clean? They never work like they’re supposed to, especially when you’re trying to order an iced tea to be delivered from the kitchen to your study. And who decided we should carry them around in our pockets? Phones are supposed to be tethered to the wall. A rant about these tribulations would be both relevant and timely.
Remember Simple, Elegant Pleasures
There was a time we appreciated gathering around a formal table for a meal, enjoying classic things like congealed salads. Now, burgers and fries are considered appropriate. This is just wrong.
Much like air travel, modern life should be reminiscent of a time when the rubes weren’t allowed to enjoy the finer things. Remember that Forrest said, “The best thing about visiting the president is the food! Now, since it was all free, and I wasn’t hungry but thirsty, I must’ve drank me 15 Dr. Peppers.” Actually, maybe skip that one. The focus group suggests it might sound supportive of the fast-food feast Trump served Clemson when it won the national championship.
Hill, you may not be in the race—yet—but that doesn’t mean your voice isn’t crucial to success in 2020, whoever’s success it is. The world is waiting to hear what you have to say on a variety of issues, both big and small. Given your ability to connect with voters, it’s incumbent on you, even if you’re not the incumbent, to use it. But you have to embrace your roots.
The way to do so is to be a boomer. Be the biggest boomer you can be. Bring forth memories of happier days, of missile crises, stagflation, and [REDACTED]. As the once-popular poster of the kitten hanging from a wire reminded us, “Hang in there.” (Note: Remember to share that poster on Instagram. Make inspirational messages memes again!) And remember, as Mama Gump said, “You’ve got to put the past behind you before you can move on.”
Actually, maybe “Forrest Gump” isn’t the best lodestar for this new project, but remember, it actually experienced success, so just massage the message as needed. You have our, well, not support, but you do have our encouragement. We’ll be waiting on you to spam us with messages on Facebook after your account gets hacked, again.",['painful']
"Due to global overpopulation, giving birth is the worst thing you can do to the planet, MacCormack sustains, while insisting that she is not advocating wiping out the existing population but rather letting it die off.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/4ctYBUKneM0/,breitbart,environment,right,20.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Giving birth to a child is “the worst thing you can do” to the climate, says philosophy professor Patricia MacCormack of Anglia Ruskin University.
The professor, author of The Ahuman Manifesto: Activism for the End of the Anthropocene who describes herself as an “old school goth,” says that the only way to save the planet is to stop having children and allow humans to become extinct.
According to the official description of the book, MacCormack “actively embraces issues like human extinction, vegan abolition, atheist occultism, death studies, a refusal of identity politics, deep ecology, and the apocalypse as an optimistic beginning.”
Due to global overpopulation, giving birth is the worst thing you can do to the planet, MacCormack sustains, while insisting that she is not advocating wiping out the existing population but rather letting it die off.
“Far from advocating mass death, genocide or eugenics, my manifesto is antinatalist,” says MacCormack. “It boycotts human reproduction due to the damage humans have perpetrated on the Earth and its other inhabitants.”
“The manifesto simply asks that humans no longer reproduce – no life is lost, no being is mourned,” she states. “If we no longer reproduce, we can care for all inhabitants already here, human and non-human, as well as care for the Earth itself by mitigating the damage already caused. It’s an activism of care.”
A native Australian, MacCormack says her opinions have been manipulated and misunderstood.
“I simply propose people not reproduce, and it automatically translated into acts of violence,” she has said.
“So, somehow, I want to kill children, which is ridiculous. Somehow, I’m proposing eugenics or some kind of ethnic population control,” she declares, “and I think that what that shows is there is an anthropocentric — or a human — impulse to read acts of grace as, automatically, acts of violence.”
“And that says a lot more about the people not reading the book and just taking over the message,” she states.
MacCormack, who moonlights as a London DJ, said that her position can be “triggering” because it forces people to confront an idea that contradicts their fundamental view of the world.
Along with her opinions regarding the human population, MacCormack advocates overcoming “human privilege” through what she calls “abolitionist veganism,” or the notion that no sentient being should be treated as property of another.
According to MacCormack, her manifesto “questions the value of human exceptionalism, asking are humans really the ‘best’ forms of life, or should we dismantle our understanding of life as a hierarchy for a more ecological, interconnected scheme of living things?”
“There are people living in the apocalypse right now — especially non-human animals — who have born into an apocalypse. They live to suffer and then they’re murdered,” she said.
Among other climate action groups, MacCormack says that those like the protest group Extinction Rebellion have the right idea but are not going far enough.
“Even Extinction Rebellion only focus on the effect this will have on human life, when climate change is something that will affect every living being on the planet,” she states.
Anglia Ruskin University holds up MacCormack’s ideas on climate, but also underscores her expertise in feminism, queer theory, posthuman ethics, animal studies, and horror films.
“Currently she is working on a new impact case study on inclusivity in mental health and criminal justice especially in relation with issues of sexual difference and Trans rights,” the university website reads.

Another spin operation appears to be afoot to thwart Attorney General William Barr’s investigation into the Russia collusion hoax and others perpetrated by high-ranking federal bureaucrats. The eye of the hurricane this weekend has focused on the Department of Justice, with news Friday that an assistant U.S. attorney declined to press charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for documented lying to federal investigators under oath.

President Trump reacted Saturday.
IG report on Andrew McCabe: Misled Investigators over roll in news media disclosure…Lacked Candor (Lied) on four separate occasions…Authotized Media Leaks to advance personal interests…IG RECOMMENDED MCCABE’S FIRING. @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2020
Becket Adams explains that:
In 2016, McCabe, who is now a paid CNN contributor, leaked sensitive details of the bureau’s investigation of the Clinton Foundation to the press. He then misled members of the FBI’s Inspection Division when they interviewed him about the leaks, according to a February 2018 Justice Department inspector general report. McCabe provided investigators with four misleading statements, three of which were while he was under oath. Giving false statements to federal investigators is a crime. In fact, it is the same crime for which the Justice Department went after President Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.
On Friday, news broke that Barr “has appointed the top federal prosecutor in St. Louis to review the criminal case against Michael Flynn – former national security adviser to President Donald Trump,” according to Reuters. This all occured in the same week an assistant U.S. attorney recommended up to nine years in prison for former Trump campaign associate Roger Stone on the grounds that he lied about gossiping about what WikiLeaks knew about Hillary Clinton’s emails.
So it appears McCabe is allowed to lie to federal investigators about corruption affecting the U.S. government, cover it up with more lies, and get off scot-free even though what he did is a crime, while Stone faces years in prison for lying about gossip that affected nothing of public importance. Flynn appears to have been entrapped by FBI agents into possibly contradicting himself while unaware that was the situation, and now faces possible prison time, to say nothing of years of legal harassment plus potential threats by prosecutors against his son. Andrew McCarthy points out the same double standard has applied to the political prosecution of former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, who “was convicted of making a trivial false statement about the date of a meeting.”
CNN’s Erin Burnett made a big deal Friday out of a federal judge saying last September that politicized decisions about whom federal lawyers prosecute are the stuff of a “banana republic.” She attempted to apply that description to the Trump Justice Department’s revisions to its prison-time request for Stone.
Yet it far better applies to unelected career bureaucrats’ use of their power to prosecute their political enemies, which comprises the heart of the “resistance” to Republican rule that will endure so long as bureaucracy has enough power to challenged elected branches of government. This bureacracy weaponization was also a hallmark of the Obama presidency, with — ironies of ironies — perhaps the biggest evidences again coming from the Department of Justice under attorneys general Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.
Remember them? The people who held tarmac meetings with Bill Clinton about hiding Hillary’s email scandal, oversaw Internal Revenue Service persecution of conservative grassroots clubs, and refused to enforce immigration laws at the behest of the president?
Now the chest-thumpers in the media are coming to obscure this weaponization of bureaucracy by attacking Trump’s frustration over the outrageous and corrupt double standards of an executive branch federal agency he is supposed to control through appointing its leaders. On Sunday, “More than 1,000 former U.S. Justice Department officials on Sunday called for Attorney General William Barr to resign” for directing the department he ostensibly controls to reduce its requested prison sentence for Stone.
On Friday, coinciding directly with the announcement of McCabe’s effective federal pardon, Sally Yates, of all people, was published in the Washington Post accusing Trump of treating Justice as “his personal grudge squad.” Yes, the deputy attorney general who helped the Obama administration set up Flynn as an early fall guy in the Spygate scandal is now taking to the pages of the Washington Post to wax poetic about DOJ’s duty to provide “impartial justice” and perform as a “neutral zone” that provides “justice without fear or favor.”
“While it is appropriate to communicate about administration policies and priorities, discussion with the White House about specific criminal cases has traditionally been off-limits,” Yates writes. Is that so? Then why was Yates, according to Obama official Susan Rice, at a meeting with President Obama about the administration’s “investigation” into the political opponents soon replacing them in the White House? Why did she “run to the White House and get it on the record that she believed Flynn to be in imminent danger of becoming a compromised national security liability, despite being fully aware that such compromise was impossible”?
Only if Yates is using cynical lies to cover her behind from what everybody will learn she and other Obama administration officials did with their power if Barr is not stopped, soon.
When the cockroaches are all scurrying across the floor, you can be sure that somebody shone a light on their nest. Earlier this week, in fact, House intelligence committee ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes told Fox Business host Lou Dobbs that the prosecutors who resigned over the altered prison recommendation for Stone are “not going to be the only example. We think there’s other examples of things that they did during the Mueller investigation that I think you and your listeners and the American people will be very interested to learn in the coming weeks, as we start to unpeel the onion of what the Mueller team was really doing.” More:
NUNES: Because I would say this, when Mueller was appointed, you have — we have to ask ourselves, he walks in the door the first day and said, OK, show me all the evidence you’ve got on the Russians. They’re like, Bob, sorry, we don’t have any Russians here. We don’t have any evidence. DOBBS: Yes. NUNES: So what the h-ll did they do for two years? They set up an obstruction of justice trap. And they sit — DOBBS: And tried — NUNES: — they went after a whole bunch of people that now got sentenced. Some already served their time. And I think all of this has to come into question now at this point.
Then on Friday, former special counsel Robert Mueller’s top “pit bull,” Andrew Weissmann, whom some speculate was the actual leader of Democrats’ unlimited Trump probe, told MSNBC host Chuck Todd that Barr’s agency has opened another investigation into McCabe plus fellow FBI corrupt-o-crats James Comey and Peter Strzok.
The real investigators are closing in on the crooked cops. No wonder they’re freaking out and using their media friends to start helping them pretend all of a sudden that they care about “democracy” while using their power to subvert the presidential administration Americans elected in 2016. What Barr is doing is what “oversight” looks like: When unelected bureaucrats are called to publicly account for what they have done with the public purse, time, and trust.
Once the whole truth has finally come out, Congress needs to be thinking about how they are going to make sure this never happens again. They will not do that by making the Department of Justice even less accountable to elected officials, as Democrats are demanding. They will do it by slashing and burning the bureaucracy and its powers. Government by and for the people will perish from the earth if unelected officials are capable of weaponizing government against the people’s elected representatives. That’s what a banana republic really is. And we don’t want one here.","['lie', 'scot-free']"

As people sip cafecito and eat croquetas at the landmark restaurant, the buzz here these days is what Cubans say is the alarming rise of Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose unabashed defense of late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has riled Cuban-Americans who view his comments as a personal attack.
In this critical swing state, Cubans in the Miami area — once largely Republican, but with a younger generation that leans more liberal — are used to being heavily wooed by political candidates who count on their support to win votes in South Florida. But Sanders’ growing popularity – even after expressing sympathetic views of Castro and other authoritarian regimes – underscores a problem for Florida Democrats, especially in South Florida, which has a large number of Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans whose families suffered under dictators.
""For me, it's very, very insulting and very sad that we are in a country, we left countries where we were running from or escaping from communism and the oppression of human rights violations, to come here and now be in a country where the front-runner for the Democratic nominee is a known communist sympathizer,"" said Maria Fernandez Gomez, a voter with Cuban roots. “He has turned off all of the Cuban population in Miami and I would venture to say the Venezuelan population, Nicaraguan population, because of those comments that he has made.""
BERNIE SANDERS 'RATTLED' BY DEBATE CROWD'S PUSHBACK ON HIS PRAISE FOR CUBA, FRANK LUNTZ SAYS
Gomez said Sanders' rhetoric is not only offensive, it’s personal. Her family left Cuba in the 1970s, and they came to Florida after being among the few lucky Cubans to take ""Freedom Flights"" to Spain.
""My father was military age when he was getting ready to leave Cuba,"" Gomez said. ""They wouldn't let him out. He was an anti-revolutionary and a political prisoner so this hits close to home for me.”
There are 1.3 million Cubans living in Florida. Estimates of how many Venezuelans live in the state range from about 60,000 to 100,000. Those numbers are critical in a purple state where just a few thousand votes could swing the election.
""The reality is that in a state that is a 2 percent state, it's very important. Sixty thousand votes could make the difference. Cubans are clearly far and beyond the most important,” said Eduardo Gamarra, a Florida International University politics professor. “Among Hispanics, the big issue is that Bernie has kind of become the caricature of what the Republicans have painted.""
Gamarra said if Sanders wins the nomination, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the Cuban and Venezuelan Democrats in Florida to back him.
""For Republicans, it will be Christmas in August if Bernie gets the nomination. I think it might even mobilize people to vote against the Democrats,"" he said.
In a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Sanders said: ""We’re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but it’s unfair to say everything’s bad. When Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a literacy program.""
VENEZUELANS BECOMING A GROWING POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FORCE IN SOUTH FLORIDA
He has also infamously praised the Cuban revolution as ""profound,"" saying it provided the country's people with ""free health care, free education, and free housing.""
The comments certainly have not endeared him to the Cuban-American community, a once strong Republican voting bloc that has been leaning left in recent years.
""I am a Cuban Democrat. I watched the interview with Bernie Sanders. I am not a supporter of his to begin with but that put the nail in the coffin for me. There is nothing good with the Castro regime,"" said Raquel Robaina, a Cuban immigrant.
Born in 1960 in Havana, Robaina said she arrived in Miami when she was two months old. She says many Democrats — including herself — are completely turned off by how out of touch Sanders is with voters like herself.
""He stated literacy as his example of something good,"" Robaina said. ""Literacy is education. Who cares if someone can read at a high level if all they're reading is propaganda and lies and they have no freedom of thought -- that is not education. That is indoctrination. Moderate Democrats, we do not agree at all with Bernie Sanders's line of thinking.""
Venezuelan immigrants sing the same tune, saying they fled the brutal Maduro regime with only the clothes on their back. Sanders was the only Democratic candidate to turn a blind eye to the Trump administration's recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as that country's president.
""I am a business owner now. I left Venezuela in 1994 but my family is living there, and it's a perfect example, this situation happening in Venezuela, between living in democracy and living in socialism. Most of the people I know are really scared of Bernie Sanders. He will have no opportunity here in Florida,"" said Luis Blanco, a Venezuelan immigrant who owns a burger joint in Sweetwater.
Those comments were echoed by Elias Attie, 20, a Venezuelan immigrant who came to Florida two years ago.
""We don’t want to pass the same thing as in Venezuela, because in Venezuela we know what happened and we don’t want that to happen here in U.S.,” Attie said. “That is the reason I left.""
Besides his rhetoric, political analysts say some of Sanders' government-run policy ideas, like his push for “Medicare-for-all,” has some moderate Latino voters running the other way and possibly toward Trump.
Maria Falcon, 85, who left Cuba for Miami 40 years ago, said she’s lived in a socialist country and it’s not as wonderful as Sanders is portraying it to be.
""Bernie Sanders likes everything free. Giving food stamps. University free … he never lived in Cuba! If you lived in Cuba, you know that it is communism, repression. People are hungry, they are not given anything for free,"" Falcon said.

“Because of our selfishness we have failed in our responsibility to be guardians and stewards of the earth,” the pope said in his video-streamed General Audience. “We need only take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is falling into serious disrepair.”
“We have polluted and despoiled it, endangering our very lives,” the pontiff continued. “For this reason, various international and local movements have sprung up in order to appeal to our consciences.”
“I deeply appreciate these initiatives; still it will be necessary for our children to take to the streets to teach us the obvious: we have no future if we destroy the very environment that sustains us,” he said in a message evocative of his past praise for climate warrior Greta Thunberg and her Fridays for Future movement.
“We have failed to care for the earth, our garden-home; we have failed to care for our brothers and sisters,” Francis said in his audience Wednesday. “We have sinned against the earth, against our neighbours, and ultimately against the Creator, the benevolent Father who provides for everyone, and desires us to live in communion and flourish together.”
The pope also said that the fiftieth Earth Day provides “an occasion for renewing our commitment to love and care for our common home and for the weaker members of our human family.”
“As the tragic coronavirus pandemic has taught us, we can overcome global challenges only by showing solidarity with one another and embracing the most vulnerable in our midst,” he said.
Human beings are fashioned from the earth and the fruit of the earth sustains our life, and yet “we are not simply ‘earthly’; we also bear within us the breath of life that comes from God,” he said.
“Thus, we live in this common home as one human family in biodiversity with God’s other creatures,” he added.
“In today’s celebration of Earth Day, we are called to renew our sense of sacred respect for the earth, for it is not just our home but also God’s home,” Francis said. “This should make us all the more aware that we stand on holy ground!”
As he has done on other occasions, the pope called on his listeners to undergo “an ecological conversion that can find expression in concrete actions” because “we cannot heal the earth unless we love and respect it.”
The pope also touted two upcoming environmental Conferences: COP15 on Biodiversity in Kunming, China, and COP26 on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland, calling on people to “come together to create a popular movement ‘from below.’”
“In this Easter season of renewal, let us pledge to love and esteem the beautiful gift of the earth, our common home, and to care for all members of our human family,” he concluded.

If pro-lifers had their way, the United States would be blacker and browner than it is today.
Another day, another pro-lifer smeared as a racist. In August, it was Catholic author J.D. Vance, whom a Washington Post writer tried to tar with the r-word, only to fall flat when it was revealed that she misrepresented what Vance said and failed to note that his wife and son are Indian American. This time around, it is Episcopalian Tucker Carlson, accused by Farhad Manjoo in Sunday’s New York Times of “advancing ethnonationalist populism” and worse.
Like some falsehoods, this latest has a kernel of truth: The Fox News host is a “populist.” But the magical-thinking leap from populism to racism, which is now de rigueur in such hit pieces, crashes and burns. Manjoo’s charge is drawn mostly from a staffer at uber-woke Media Matters, whose job, apparently, is to watch Fox News and follow social media. White nationalists, reports Manjoo ominously, quoting the Media Matters researcher, “look at [Tucker] as a thought leader and an influential thinker.”
So? Whatever else you make of him, that’s what Carlson is. Anyone within reach of a television could say the same, from Antifa members to fans of “Stranger Things.” If we’re really going to talk about racism, let’s ask a more interesting question than any in the New York Times piece: Who, exactly, thinks that adding more brown and black people to the world is a good thing — and who doesn’t?
‘Family Planning’ Means Reducing Minorities
Whether it means to or not, team left amounts to keeping the world a whiter place. Recall Bernie Sanders’ recent open fretting about “overpopulation” and the need for more birth control in the “poor countries.” On any short list of those nations — say, the poorest 20 — almost all lie in Africa. To well-off, aging, lefty Westerners, more young Africans amounts to a problem.
On the global, liberal left, that same preoccupation with Africans and their fertility is endemic. In July 2017, childless French President Emmanuel Macron worried at an appearance in Germany over the “civilizational” challenges facing Africa, singling out the fact that women in some countries still have “seven or eight children.” Elsewhere that same summer, Canada’s minister of international development, Marie-Claude Bibeau, called abortion “a tool to end poverty.” En route to a “family planning” meeting in Rwanda, she was not speaking of Canadians.
The forward-looking Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is another powerful institution, the resources of which, whatever the intentions behind them, will have the effect of bringing fewer African babies into the world. Which, exactly, are the families that apparently need to be “planned” — a euphemism for “reduced,” since “family planning” never includes family expansion? Check the faces on the relevant section of the website. They do not resemble Icelanders or Finns.
It isn’t only the prospect of more Africans that summons anxiety in some places. In 2009, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a slip akin to Macron’s, when she said in an interview with New York Times Magazine that “at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” She didn’t mean descendants of those who sailed on the Mayflower.
Pro-Lifers Would Bless the World with Brown Babies
So returning to our original question: Who, exactly, doesn’t think bringing more brown and black humans into the world is a problem?
One contender is the Catholic Church. Pope Francis just concluded a tour of several countries on the continent, tacitly affirming what everyone who can count already knows: The future of Christianity lies in Africa. It’s in tradition-minded Africa that Christianity has grown explosively during these last decades. African priests and ministers are now routinely being exported to the United States, to re-evangelize the descendants of the people who first evangelized them.
The pro-life movement isn’t for keeping down the numbers of brown and black people, either. In such circles — and only in such circles — the fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned. The pro-life Lozier Institute, among others, keeps steady track of disparities such as these: “In 2016, as in previous years, more African American babies were aborted than were born alive in New York City.” Outside the pro-life movement, this racial disparity garners not a peep, including from people who accuse others of promoting “whiteness.”
Say what you like about pro-lifers, including Carlson, but they don’t think whitening up the country is a good thing. That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know. It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness.
Here’s an irony: Thanks to Roe, America is a whiter place than it would otherwise have become. If pro-lifers had had their way, on the other hand, America would be considerably blacker and browner than it is today. So do the thought experiment: Which result might a real supremacist like more?","['whiter', 'blacker', 'browner', 'irony', 'considerably', 'pro-lifers']"
"In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/iBeQzweSWhA/,breitbart,sport,right,21.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As biological males and other trans athletes continue to rack-up an impressive record of victory while competing against biological females, a recent article by the Associated Press sounds the alarm over the “resentment,” that success might bring.
In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport.
The AP wrote:
Exhibit A is a recent public exchange involving tennis great Martina Navratilova, who came out as a lesbian in 1981 and is a longtime gay-rights activist. She now stands accused of being “transphobic” after asserting that many transgender women — even if they’ve undergone hormone treatment — have an unfair advantage over other female competitors. ‘A man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organization is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires,’ Navratilova wrote in a Feb. 17 op-ed for The Sunday Times of London. ‘It’s insane and it’s cheating.’ Supporters of trans inclusion in sports were aghast. One advocacy group, Athlete Ally, ousted Navratilova from its advisory board and said she would no longer be designated one of its ambassadors. ‘Trans women athletes aren’t looking to take over women’s sport,’ Athlete Ally said. ‘They are women and want to compete in the sport they love, just as any other athlete would.’
Though, whether transgender women (biological males) intend to take over women’s sports or not. The fact of the matter is that’s exactly what’s happening. Transgender female runners took first and second place recently, in the Connecticut track and field championships.
Much to the dismay of natural born female competitors like Selina Soule, who believe that male competitors make the competition feel rigged.
“We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing,” biologically female teen runner Selina Soule said. “I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.”
In addition, a 6-3 250 pound Australian handball player named Hannah Mouncey — a biological male — is the most physically dominating force in that sport.
However, according to champion transgender track cyclist Rachel McKinnon, the notion that transgender women will come to dominate women’s sports, is an “irrational fear.”
“No such thing will ever happen,” McKinnon wrote. “This is an irrational fear of trans women.”
LGBTQ-rights activist Helen Carroll, believes there’s a hypocrisy in the criticism of trans athletes. Chiefly, that people seem okay with trans athletes as long as they are losing. Though, if the trans athletes are winning, only then do people really start to care.
“As long as trans people are losing and are not the best, everything is OK,” Carroll said. “As soon as they start winning, that’s when the vitriol comes out about how they’re really still a man.”
As an example of this resentment, the AP uses the victory of trans woman mountain biker Michelle Dumaresq, who won the national title in 2006. As the AP writes, “second-place finisher Danika Schroeter donned a T-shirt provided by her boyfriend during the medal ceremony. It read: “100% Pure Woman Champ.
“Dumaresq later told The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, ‘That was the moment I stopped loving the sport. … That kind of wrecked it for me.’
The article even took aim at Breitbart, for accurately reporting the biological gender of transgender female cyclist Rachel McKinnon, after winning a track cycling championship in October.
Breitbart.com headlined its story, ‘Biological Man Wins Women’s World Cycling Championship,’ helping to trigger an avalanche of social-media attacks against McKinnon. ‘I’m immensely proud of my accomplishment,’ McKinnon wrote a few days later. ‘But not all of it has been positive. … I’d say the negative comments have outweighed the positive by about 3,000 to one.’
Of course, the Breitbart headline cannot be factually disputed. Nor, for that matter, can the Associated Press headline. Resentment does exist, in some cases, for transgender female athletes. However, much of that resentment is coming from women. Who, at least until recently, the ideological left had at least pretended to care about.
Was feminism and the advancement of women’s participation in sports just a passing fad? Did it go out of style? Exactly when and where did feminism lose the intersectional war with transgender rights?
Moreover, when did the left abandon the principles of science and fairness?
Democrat politicians have never shied away from reminding Americans of all the unfair practices that keep women from having success in the workplace. Yet, now that women are facing far more unfairness in the world of sports, not only does the left act as though the unfairness doesn’t exist, but cheers it on? What could be more anti-woman than actively rooting for an competitive arrangement where women are doomed to fail?
For whatever reason, it appears that the ideological left has abandoned women at the altar.

On Monday, a UN report circulated around establishment media outlets like Reuters, AFP, and NPR reported a false story that claimed Trump was currently holding about 100,000 migrant children in custody.
“More than 100,000 children are currently being held in migration-related detention in the United States, often in violation of international law, the UN said Monday,” an AFP story on the UN report stated.
NPR ran with the UN report as well, writing that the Trump administration “is still holding more than 100,000 children in migration-related detention.”
The author of the UN report, though, now admits that the migrant child detention figures are from 2015, when Obama was president.
“The author of the report has clarified that his figures do not represent the number of children currently in migration-related US detention, but the total number of children in migration-related US detention in 2015,” the AFP wrote on Twitter, noting that they would delete their false story.
AFP is withdrawing this story. The author of the report has clarified that his figures do not represent the number of children currently in migration-related US detention, but the total number of children in migration-related US detention in 2015. We will delete the story. https://t.co/p30UjEWl7u — AFP news agency (@AFP) November 19, 2019
After realizing that the UN report falsely blamed Trump for Obama’s migrant child detention rate, Reuters deleted their story, writing in a post:
A Nov. 18 story headlined ‘U.S. has world’s highest rate of children in detention -U.N. study’ is withdrawn. The United Nations issued a statement on Nov. 19 saying the number was not current but was for the year 2015. No replacement story will be issued. [Emphasis added]
Multiple leading Democrats and the Democrat National Committee (DNC) ran with the UN report, blaming Trump for Obama holding 100,000 migrant children in detention in 2015:
The over 100,000 kids in immigration-related custody are kids the Trump administration has separated from their families, detained in cages, & denied basic necessities & medical care.

House Republicans are gearing up for a sustained push to expose leftist Democrats in the House Democrat majority on their increasingly extreme views on abortion.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/08/exclusive-house-gop-plans-sustained-effort-to-expose-leftist-democrats-on-abortion/amp/?__twitter_impression=true,breitbart,abortion,right,21.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"House Republicans are gearing up for a sustained push to expose leftist Democrats in the House Democrat majority on their increasingly extreme views on abortion, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.
Specifically, Republicans–as they have demonstrated for three consecutive legislative days–intend to push for a floor vote against Democrat Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s wishes on a piece of legislation from Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) that would ensure babies who are born alive following an abortion attempt are given the same medical treatment and care any other newborn baby would receive.
“Protecting innocent life shouldn’t be a partisan issue and it shouldn’t be difficult. Infanticide is barbaric and the growing trend of Democrats advocating it is frightening,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, told Breitbart News. “Republicans are united in seeing that a bill protecting babies who survived an attempted abortion urgently receives a vote on the House Floor. It already passed the House with Democratic support last Congress. But so far the new Democrat majority refuse to even consider the bill. But we will ask again. And again. And again, until this body speaks up for life.”
The House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, added in an emailed statement to Breitbart News that the Democrats’ extremism has been exposed and will continue to be shown to the public by the GOP’s sustained effort. Scalise said:
It’s absolutely barbaric that in this country it would be allowed to kill a baby after it’s born alive during an abortion, but that’s exactly what some elected Democrat leaders have advocated in recent weeks. Yesterday, the moral indifference of the House Democrat majority was on full display when they refused my motion to even give the Born Alive Survivors Protection Act a vote on the House Floor. Every American deserves to know if their representative stands against infanticide or not, and that’s why this week I began the discharge petition process that would force a vote on our bill. Now Democrats will have to make a choice: stand with the most radical elements of their base, or with the vast majority of Americans who are appalled at the murder of innocent life.
Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, added in an emailed statement to Breitbart News that Republicans are fighting “pure evil” on the part of those who would kill babies after being born.
Cheney told Breitbart News:
This is about killing babies after they are born and it is the face of pure evil. We’ve seen the leadership of the Democrat Party on the Hill remain silent while elected leaders, including the Governor of Virginia, describe in very cold, clinical terms how he would facilitate the murder of a baby that has already been born. I want to say personally, as a mother of five kids, the idea that we have to describe what the Democrats are doing, is really horrific. I want to ask mothers across this country to join with us to make sure that we don’t see our maternity wards turn into killing fields, which is what the Democrats would do if we don’t stop this. House Republicans are absolutely dedicated to stopping this, and dedicated to protecting the most vulnerable among us, which is the unborn. The notion that we’re having the debate about whether or not you should be able to kill babies is absolutely horrific and evil, and we will stand up against that.
Earlier this week, at a press conference, McCarthy and GOP leaders rolled out their push on the anti-infanticide bill from Wagner, recommitting their efforts to it. Last Congress, the bill was pushed in the House of Representatives by then-Congresswoman and now Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and it passed with bipartisan support. Six Democrats crossed the aisle to join all the Republicans in the then-GOP-led-majority in January 2018 to pass the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The bill did not make it in the Senate.
Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, and with states like New York and Virginia among others pushing boundaries on abortion to extremes, the Republicans in Congress is rolling out a long-term push to force the Democrats to hold a vote on the bill. Wagner, the Congresswoman from Missouri who has taken up the Blackburn bill mantle in the House, told Breitbart News that she is “proud” to push for a vote on this critical legislation protecting babies who are born alive surviving abortions.
“I was proud to introduce the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and help lead the discharge petition process to force a vote on this critical piece of legislation,” Wagner told Breitbart News. “Babies born alive deserve our protection and the proper medical care that any newborn would receive. I called for unanimous consent on the House Floor to bring this commonsense legislation up for a vote so we can protect these babies, but we were denied that vote. My colleagues and I will keep fighting for the precious life of these babies and we will keep calling for this vote so born-alive babies can receive lifesaving medical care when they are at their most vulnerable.”
The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, among other things, requires by law that healthcare professionals present at a live birth use their skills to preserve the life and health of a child at the same degree of care that would be offered to any child born prematurely at the same gestational age–and that after these efforts conclude, those healthcare professionals are legally responsible for the transportation and admission to a hospital. It also requires health officials to report any violations to law enforcement and penalizes intentional killing of born-alive children with various fines and up to five years in prison.
Leadership officials in the House GOP conference told Breitbart News that until the Democrats schedule a floor vote on this, on every legislative day when the House is in session, a different House Republican will go to the floor and ask for unanimous consent to have a vote on the bill.
Democrats have already blocked Republicans’ efforts three times. McCarthy tried on Wednesday, Scalise tried on Thursday, and Wagner tried on Friday. Cheney is expected to go to the floor next week, and many other members will get in the fight. There will be a different member each day pushing for unanimous consent on Wagner’s bill until Pelosi’s Democrat leadership team, which remains steadfastly in favor of not protecting babies born alive, cracks and allows a vote.
“This will force Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrat Majority to either go on record in blocking that request, or immediately proceed to passage of this important legislation,” a GOP leadership aide told Breitbart News.
Republicans say they will not be deterred and are ready for the long haul if necessary, because they believe that when the House votes on this bill protecting babies, many Democrats will be forced to–as six of them did in early 2018 when the Blackburn version of the bill passed the House on a bipartisan vote under Republican control–vote against their party leadership’s increasingly more extreme position on abortion.
Republicans are ready to take this request for unanimous consent on this bill to the floor, leadership aides say, every day that the House is in session for months and months–even more than a hundred days–if necessary.
The effort began on Wednesday, the day after President Donald Trump’s State of the Union addres in the very same chamber, where the president asked Congress to pass legislation protecting the most innocent lives–newborn babies and the unborn. Trump also criticized recent developments in New York, which made late-term abortions legal, and in Virginia, where the Democrat Governor Ralph Northam has come under serious fire for comments supporting abortion of a child during the birth of that child.
President Trump said:
Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
On Wednesday afternoon, after Wagner reintroduced the bill Wednesday morning and leadership touted it at a press conference, McCarthy went to the floor to push for a vote via unanimous consent. Pelosi’s designate in the Speaker’s chair that day, Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL), blocked the bill, saying Pelosi’s leadership team had not agreed to it.
Here’s video of the exchange between McCarthy and Pelosi’s designate:
Then, the next day, Scalise went to the floor and tried again. Pelosi’s designate, a different Democrat this time, blocked the GOP:
And Wagner tried again on Friday:
As each of these battles happens, McCarthy’s team and the rest of the GOP leadership are blasting out press releases to the national media highlighting the Democrat opposition to protecting babies from being killed during or after being born. Republicans also intend to push the message hard on social media, ripping Democrats for supporting what amounts to murder of babies already born:
According to a report in the Washington Post on Thursday, the GOP clearly views this as a winning issue politically–as it hands the Republicans the moral high ground on abortion, as the extremely radical view of killing a baby after he or she has been born–not when a baby is still in the womb–is so out there most of the country is aligned against it, even supporters of abortion.
Scalise is quoted in that Post story as saying the New York and Virginia developments on the life issue seem to have “woke a sleeping giant”– the movement of people across the country disgusted, outraged, and driven to action to protect human life from Democrats who could care less about it or would go so far as to pass laws stretching abortion to radical extremes.
The Northam comments hit America hard. He was making the case in favor of Virginia statehouse Delegate Kathy Tran’s bill that would allow abortion when a woman is going into labor–meaning as a baby is being born–and took it much, much further.
Northam, a Democrat, said in a radio interview with WTOP, adding:
This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers, physicians, and the mothers and fathers that are involved. When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician—more than one physician, by the way—and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s non-viable.
Northam, who was a doctor before he got into politics, then said that the child would be “kept comfortable” while doctors and parents made a decision whether or not to kill him or her. Northam said:
If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion. We want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.
Northam’s comments reportedly so outraged his medical colleagues that they leaked to the media photographs from his yearbook page in medical school that show two men in racially offensive garb–one in blackface, the other in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. Northan originally admitted one of the men was him but would not specify which, then walked back his admission and is now denying either of the men are him and refuses to resign despite nearly all of the Democrat Party nationally pushing for his resignation.
The scandal has rocked the Democrat Party nationally and reverberated heavily throughout Virginia, as not just Northam but both his presumed successors–next in line Democrat Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and the number three in line to the governor’s mansion, Democrat Attorney General Mark Herring–have been consumed by scandals of their own.
Fairfax has been hit with a pair of sexual assault allegations, including one woman who accused him of raping her. He denies the allegations despite calls from national Democrats for him to resign as well. Herring has admitted he too donned blackface in his college days. Herring had previously called on Northam to resign over Northam’s admission at a press conference that he wore blackface at a different time than the photo that appeared in his yearbook.
Republicans’ renewed focus on abortion in the wake of both the New York and Virginia developments–among others nationwide–has widespread public support. Recent polling shows that the public wants restrictions on abortion, and wants Roe v. Wade reinterpreted so as to allow for restrictions:
What’s more, Democrats who have embraced radical and extreme late-term abortion policy views in recent weeks–not just Northam–have come under fire. New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo, another Democrat who is reportedly considering running for president in 2020, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times defending his state’s radical new law by saying: “I am a former altar boy.”
“My Roman Catholic values are my personal values. The decisions I choose to make in my life, or in counseling my daughters, are based on my personal moral and religious beliefs,” Cuomo wrote, backing the law by saying his oath is not to his personal beliefs but to the law and the Constitution.",['extreme']

King began by praising defeated Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, declaring she had the “best response” he can recall either Republican or Democrat giving and how she pointed out the “differences” between the two parties.
“She talked about voting rights, she talked about climate change, and she talked about guns. You did not hear any of those subjects from the president of the United States,” King told the panel. “Democrats believe that animates their coalition, they believe it helps them, they believe, especially on the issue of climate change, especially on the issue of voting rights, it helps them to talk about things that the president won’t talk about.”

“A guy like Sleepy Joe Biden was in there for 43 years … he was vice president for eight years,” Trump said. “He didn’t do a thing, his crime bill was a disaster.”
Biden delivered a speech on Tuesday criticizing Trump for fanning the “flames of hate” and trafficking in “fear and division” for political gain.
The president spoke about Biden in an interview with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on his radio show.
Trump noted Biden finally took off his mask to give a speech during the coronavirus pandemic.
“He took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven’t seen his face in a long time … then he started speaking through the mask again, he feels comfortable with a mask on I think, even though there was no one near him,” Trump said.
Trump also reminded listeners about how poorly Biden treated Justice Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings in the Senate to underline race relations.
“What he did with Clarence Thomas was a disaster … a black man, a great justice as it turns out,” Trump said, adding, “Go back to those horrible days the way he treated Clarence Thomas, they write books about it, there was nobody worse than Biden.”
Kilmeade asked Trump what could be done about improving policing after the widespread protests and riots after the death of George Floyd.
“We have to get the police departments, everybody has to get better, this is a long term problem, this didn’t happen today,” Trump said, calling it a “very sad problem” in the United States.","['ripped', 'failing']"

But quiet efforts are underway to expose and punish as many of these hidden offenders as possible -- and ensure none find a lasting haven in the U.S.
“What survivors want is for the truth to come out through the due process,” Dixon Osburn, Executive Director of the Center for Justice & Accountability told Fox News. “When we prove with evidence, that is really empowering for individuals who have suffered.”
SHUNNED CONGOLESE REFUGEE ON RAISING A SON BORN OUT OF RAPE: THE BABY HAD A RIGHT TO LIVE
Just over a month ago, in a civil case championed by San Francisco-based nonprofit CJA, a U.S. jury ruled Somali native Yusuf Abdi Ali shot and tortured at least one other refugee -- who now also lives in the U.S. -- when Ali served as a commander in the national army amid Somalia’s civil war in the late 1980s. Up until the trial in May, Ali drove for Uber and Lyft in Virginia – scoring the jobs even after he was deported from Canada due to his past and despite another suit filed against him that resulted in Ali being placed on administrative leave from a previous position as security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC.
A jury awarded the torture survivor some $500,000 in damages in the CJA case.
It marked the third CJA victory in cases brought against those who committed shocking human rights violations dating back to the early ’90s war in Somalia alone. Yet it's merely the tip of the iceberg of war criminals lurking -- and working -- on U.S. turf.
“In one case years ago, there was a Haitian commander who was living in Miami and appeared on television after winning the lottery. One of his victims saw it and said, ‘wait a minute,’” Osburn recalled, highlighting one of the more than a dozen investigations currently ongoing, ranging from commanders and criminal town mayors to narco-traffickers and other foreign perpetrators. “Never again means never again, and we are doing what we can as members of civil society. We hope each case stands for something bigger.”
Using any means at its disposal -- litigation, transnational justice, policy advocacy -- to bring human rights abusers to justice, CJA has taken on cases involving crimes from areas ranging from El Salvador and Guatemala; to the Balkans, the Horn of Africa, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Chile, Somalia and beyond.
The firm has successfully represented 45 Cambodian Americans in taking on senior Khmer Rouge officials responsible for carrying out mass genocide, starvation and other atrocities in the 1970s under the repressive rule of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. And in the aftermath of the Bosnian War, CJA – on behalf of torture victims – took on Nikola Vuckovic, who had been able to enter the U.S. as a refugee and lead a quiet life in Atlanta before being accused of subjecting his Muslim neighbors to torture at the height of the conflict.
More recently, a case this year was won against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, regarding the president’s direct involvement in the targeted killing of American journalist Marie Colvin amid the vicious civil war and dissident crackdown in 2012.
In April, some ten years since the end of Sri Lanka’s brutal civil war, a former defense chief and U.S. citizen, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who oversaw the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels, was tracked to a Trader Joe’s parking lot in Los Angeles and served with a civil court complaint accusing him of murder and torture. A spokesman for Gotabaya has consistently denied the accusations and deemed them “politically motivated.” He's reportedly since taken steps to renounce his U.S. citizenship.
Leading the charge on the U.S. government front is the Human Rights Violators War Crimes Center – which was instituted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement more than a decade ago and is operated by Homeland Security Investigations. With an interagency approach and a growing team of about 50 analysts, researchers, attorneys and investigators focused on different geographic regions of the world, the HRVWCC relentlessly investigates individuals residing within the United States, or U.S. persons abroad, suspected of having executed serious human rights violations, including genocide, torture and war crimes.
“When conflicts happen, perpetrators find themselves in the mix of the refugee or displaced persons’ flow. Over time, sometimes we can find out fairly quickly and other times it takes ten or fifteen years for someone to come to us and say ‘hey, this guy did this back in my country,’” HRVWCC Chief Mark Shaffer told Fox News.
Since 2003, ICE has arrested more than 415 individuals for human rights-related violations under an array of criminal and/or immigration statutes. During that same 16-year period, Fox News has learned, ICE obtained deportation orders against and physically removed more than 900 known or suspected human rights violators and has facilitated the departure of 152 others from U.S. soil.
HRVWCC has issued more than 75,000 lookouts for individuals from more than 110 countries and stopped over 300 human rights violators and war crime suspects from entering the country.
As it stands, HSI has more than 170 active investigations into suspected human rights violators and is currently pursuing more than 1600 leads and removal cases involving suspected human rights violators in the U.S.
VACATIONS ON THE EDGE: THE RISE OF THE WAR TOURISM INDUSTRY
Where possible, the HRVWCC teams up with the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue criminal prosecutions pegged to one of four specific areas – genocide, torture, war crimes and recruitment or use of child soldiers – but most often, authorities instead have to turn to the Immigration and Nationality Act and use administrative charges of immigration fraud. This often involves individuals having failed to disclose their nebulous past professions or validating themselves as being of high moral standing.
“So we use what we call the 'Al Capone method,' where we'll use every tool that we have in the toolbox to try and bring some type of justice to these cases,” explained Mona Ragheb, a senior legal advisor with DHS and one of the specialized unit’s few founding members. “We look at each case and try to find a criminal statute that will fly.”
Ragheb also pointed out that the Torture Statute was enacted in 1994 and the legislation against those who recruit child soldiers was enacted in 2008, so, while the unit encounters many examples of those who committed such violations before that date, they are not able to prosecute the offenders criminally on those grounds, meaning they have to turn to the immigration violations.
In one case, a 47-year-old Rwandan man, Jean Leonard Teganya, earlier this month was sentenced to at least eight years in prison for lying about the role he played in the country’s 1994 genocide in order to be granted asylum in the United States.
Meanwhile, Ilija Josipovic – who in 2003 settled as a refugee with his family in Ohio having denied any prior military service – was exposed by investigators 12 years later as having been a high-ranking Bosnian Serb officer and accused of war crimes. ICE agents returned him to Bosnia in 2017.
That same year, a 73-year-old Delaware man, Mohammed Jabateh, was convicted of concealing his prior life as a Liberian war criminal during the conflict in the 1990s. And in 2014, a Lebanese-born man Mahmoud Bazzi – who came to the U.S. on someone else’s passport in 1993 and went on to get a valid green card and set up an ice-cream business in Michigan – was accused by two former members of the Irish Defense Forces of kidnapping and torturing them during a UN mission in 1980. He was then convicted and deported.
Even Nazi war criminals in the U.S. have come under the glare in recent decades.
Characterized as the last Nazi war criminal in America, Jakiw Palij – who served as a forced labor camp guard and trained other Nazi perpetrators – came to the U.S. four years after WWll ended as “a farmer” and was later granted citizenship. When the longtime New Yorker’s murky past was brought to the surface decades later, Palij was finally deprived of his citizenship in 2003. But it wasn’t until last year, at the urging of President Trump, that the then 95-year-old was carried out of his Queens home by ICE agents on a stretcher and expelled to Germany.
Before that case, research led by HRVWCC paved the way for concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk to have his U.S. citizenship revoked in 2009 before he was sent to Munich to stand trial. Similarly, a naturalized American citizen in Massachusetts, Aleksandras Lileikis – who was later proven by unit investigators to have been a top Nazi collaborator – was stripped of his citizenship more than a decade earlier and returned to Lithuania.
While the overwhelming majority of those exposed are male, female war criminals are among the mix, too.
One refugee known as Sammy Yetisen who came to the U.S. in the 1990s built a new existence in Oregon, had a child and became a naturalized citizen in 2002. But in 2012, Yetisen was stripped of her citizenship and extradited after it was discovered that she – using the alias Rasema Handanovic aka Zolja – had targeted Bosnian Croat citizens by firing squad as part of an elite special-forces unit with the Supreme Command staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was later revealed she fled her unit in 1995 and sought refuge in the U.S. under the guise she was a Muslim and thus had no safe place to turn to in Bosnia.
HRVWCC’s team also works to ensure human rights violators are prohibited from future entry, what they deem a “preventative mission.”
“It’s a team of intelligence research specialists who specialize in a particular region of the world, or on a specific conflict,” Shaffer said. “Usually the information we gather is enough to prevent (an involved individual) from entering the United States.”

Nonetheless, for some victims, justice is held up by a fear of coming forward. One California-based Iraqi, who fled to the U.S. amid the U.S.-led operation in 2003 after being threatened by Baghdad militias because of his work for American contractors, told Fox News the very person who threatened his family and firebombed a relative’s house was believed to be in Texas, according to the man's social media. Yet the victim – still afraid for his family and insisting he wants nothing more than a drama-free, quiet life – said he just wants the matter to go away.
“If there is no investigation and no prosecution, often there is no justice for these victims – ever,” Ragheb stressed. “We always say never forget and never again, and we always hope our work here can persuade countries who might have amnesty to also live like that.”

"For some years now, conservative and libertarian education policy experts have warned against voucher systems in favor, instead, of tax-credit scholarships and education savings accounts, which are less likely to drag the regulations and mandates of government schools into the private arena.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/01/18/jeb-calls-education-a-civil-rights-issue-no-mention-of-his-support-for-common-core/,breitbart,student-debt,right,22.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush announced his “budget neutral” education plan on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, as he also lamented income inequality, asserted that education is a “civil rights issue,” and advocated for more opportunities for pre-K education for children of low-income families.
At the same time, while Bush invoked the talking points of the Common Core state standards—the federally-funded education reform that he championed for years—he failed to mention it by name in his plan.
In his “Blueprint for a 21st Century American Education System”—posted on Medium—Bush writes:
Too many low-income students start kindergarten already years behind their more affluent counterparts. Only one-third of students graduate high school prepared for college or a good career. And our higher education system has become too expensive for many Americans to afford. To achieve equal opportunity and increased economic growth, we must provide every child the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the increasingly competitive 21st century global economy.
“As the nation honors Dr. Martin Luther King and his legacy today, I firmly believe that ensuring every individual has access to a quality education is the great civil rights challenge of our time,” he said, pointing out that his plan requires “a complete overhaul of a system from one that serves bureaucracies to one that serves the needs of families and students…”
Though Bush urged states to sign on to the Common Core standards in exchange for a shot at federal stimulus dollars and waivers from the onerous No Child Left Behind federal law, the founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE) says his education plan is built on “four conservative principles”:
1) education decisions should be made as close to the student as possible 2) choice of all kinds should be expanded 3) transparency is essential to accountability 4) innovation requires flexibility
During the years Bush was campaigning for Common Core, he repeated the talking points that the reform was “state-led,” and that local school districts could still set their own curriculum, even though the Common Core-aligned tests—developed by federally-funded test consortia—would determine the curriculum since both students and teachers would be evaluated based on students’ performance on Common Core tests.
Bush writes he will “leverage the limited role of the federal government to improve all schools” through an expansion of school choice by doubling support for charter schools, strengthening the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program—which is a school voucher system—and allowing federal dollars to follow the child—also known as “portability.”
The devil is in the details, however, since—while some charter schools are effective in achieving student success—others have been examples of cronyism and corruption as a result of arrangements between politicians and private businesses. And while “portability”—i.e., when taxpayer funds, known as a “voucher,” for a child’s public education follows a child to the private school of his or her choice—sounds “conservative,” the reality is that it is not only the money that follows along with the child, but also increased government regulation. For some years now, conservative and libertarian education policy experts have warned against voucher systems in favor, instead, of tax-credit scholarships and education savings accounts, which are less likely to drag the regulations and mandates of government schools into the private arena.
Ironically, Bush claims to want to tamp down on federal intrusion in academic standards, curriculum or content.
“Right now, too many regulations drown the system in compliance costs, wasting valuable resources,” he writes. “We need to give states the flexibility to reform and innovate to meet the unique needs of their students.”
“Portability,” through vouchers, however, could bring further regulations into private and religious schools. And with Bush’s past advocacy for Common Core, conservatives will find it hard to envision him as a presidential candidate who would be fighting for less regulation.
Teachers’ unions and liberals in general, on the other hand, are against school choice and vouchers for different reasons—mostly informed by their desire to keep federal funding flowing into public schools and public school teacher jobs.
Bush writes he hopes to drive down college costs by creating “state databases so every student can see the average unemployment rate, earnings, graduation rates and debt repayment rate of programs they are considering.”
“We need students to be able to judge the cost and quality of programs so they can make better choices and hold schools accountable,” the GOP contender writes, and—once again—while the idea sounds like it would create a sense of competitiveness among colleges and universities, the creation of “state databases” is likely to be a concern for many parents that their children’s private data will be part of the mix.
For prospective college students, Bush plans to stem student loan debt by giving all high school graduates access to a $50,000 line of credit through an education savings account to pay for college and career training.
“For every $10,000 spent, students would repay 1 percent of their income for 25 years,” Bush proposes, and also includes a plan for those in debt now to allow that debt to be “discharged in bankruptcy,” with the possibility of extended repayment periods.
“I know what needs to be done,” Bush asserts. “As governor of Florida, I increased student achievement across the board, particularly for those most at risk, and as president, I will do the same.”",['drag']
"On Tuesday, AOC once again ignited a media firestorm when she continued bashing President Trump's administration by alluding to Nazi Germany while describing the way Trump detained migrant families on the border.",,fox-news,immigration,right,23.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has only been in Congress for a matter of months, but in that short period of time she's been able to prompt widespread outrage and catch the attention of some of America's most prominent politicians.
The self-described Democratic Socialist has attracted criticism and surprise over controversial policies like the ""Green New Deal,"" as well as her unorthodox political views that seemed to stun people on both sides of the aisle.
On Tuesday, AOC once again ignited a media firestorm when she continued bashing President Trump's administration by alluding to a term used to describe the horrific conditions Jews endured during the Holocaust. Here's a review of that comment and the many others that seemed to lead one pundit to dub her ""the most powerful Democrat in office.""
TOMI LAHREN: ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS (YES, I MEAN IT)...
Labeling Trump's migrant centers 'concentration camps'
In what were perhaps her most controversial comments to date, AOC alluded to Nazi Germany while describing the way Trump detained migrant families on the border. ""The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the land of the free is extraordinarily disturbing,"" she said during a livestream that went viral on social media.
Her comments quickly caught the attention of her colleague, House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. Cheney, among others, suggested that the freshman congresswoman was grossly ignorant of history and disrespected Jews by bringing up a term often used to describe their imprisonment under the Nazis.
But Ocasio-Cortez and many others suggested her comments weren't outrageous because ""concentration camps"" were markedly different than the ""death camps"" that Holocaust victims experienced. Some weren't buying it, though, and Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan -- whose agency is partially responsible for detaining migrants -- even weighed in, calling her comments ""reckless, irresponsible, misinformed and wrong.""

The world will end in 12 years because of climate change
AOC started her congressional term with a bang -- proposing a multitrillion-dollar plan that would radically alter the economy with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. Initially dismissed as absurd by critics, her ""Green New Deal"" eventually made its way into Democratic presidential candidate's official policies.
While decrying the impacts of climate change in January, AOC seemed to conjure the most frequent conservative criticism of progressives on the issue -- namely, that they blow the threat way out of proportion. AOC not only invoked World War II, but suggested that the world would ""end in 12 years."" “Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we’re like: ‘The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'"" she said.
Her comments received widespread ridicule, although two-thirds of Democrats shared that view. Months after her comments, she derided Republicans for failing to recognize the ""dry humor + sarcasm"" in her statement. ""But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows,"" she tweeted.

Amazon pays its workers 'starvation wages'
As a ""Democratic Socialist,"" AOC has joined her colleagues -- Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., -- in fiercely criticizing big corporations for their purported greed and oppression of working class Americans.
In June, the freshman congresswoman doubled down on her previous criticism of one of the biggest U.S. corporations -- online retail giant Amazon -- and claimed CEO Jeff Bezos was able to make billions in part because he paid his workers ""starvation wages.""
That obviously didn't go over well with Amazon which blasted her allegations as ""absurd."" ""Amazon associates receive industry-leading pay starting at $15 an hour,"" an Amazon spokesperson said, citing the pay rate AOC and other progressives sought to install as the federal minimum wage.

Cauliflower isn't just something you grow in a garden -- it's an outgrowth of colonialism
As part of AOC's emphasis on race, she has derided as so-called ""colonial"" acts that the alleged perpetrators don't even realize were oppressive. She warned, for example, that New Yorkers should be wary of blindly planting food like Cauliflower in the Bronx.
During a video, AOC addressed people who complained that planting Yucca -- a plant often found in Mexico and Guatemala -- was too difficult. Where they apparently saw an attempt to avoid cumbersome gardening, she saw a perpetuation of imperial conquest. “But when you really think about it -- when someone says that it’s ‘too hard’ to do a green space that grows Yucca instead of, I don’t know, cauliflower or something -- what you’re doing is you’re taking a colonial approach to environmentalism,” she said.
“That is why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements because they come with the colonial lens on them.” Those comments seemed to foreshadow AOC's later claim that people were perpetuating ""the legacy of colonization"" when they pushed for Puerto Rican statehood.

Border agents are caging children and injecting them with drugs
AOC's concentration camp comments weren't the first time she blasted the way children were treated at the border. During a long Instagram session in April, the New York congresswoman appeared to accuse Customs and Border Protection agents of forcibly injecting child migrants with drugs and putting them in cages.
“At least I’m not trying to cage children at the border and inject them with drugs,” she told viewers. “That’s not a mistake. That is a deliberate policy to attack people based on their national origin. That’s not a mistake, that’s just hatred. That’s just cruelty. That’s just wrong!” She seemed to be referring to an earlier lawsuit claiming migrant children were forced to take psychotropic medication.

GOP acts like a demon-possessed girl vomiting pea soup
Republicans might have felt a sigh of relief when AOC compared them to ""Office"" character Dwight Schrute -- at least she wasn't likening them to a demon. During that same Instagram session in April, AOC said Republicans' negativity reminded her of actress Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist.""
“The reason Republicans hate me so much is because I confront them directly on their moral — their lack of moral grounding on so many issues and, not just that, but the reason they're so upset and they act like that girl in 'The Exorcist’ that's like vomiting pea soup, that’s like them and negativity,” she said.","['ignited', 'firestorm', 'bashing', 'alluding', 'Nazi', 'Germany']"

“Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far,” Trump said.
“With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high,” Trump said.
Trump’s speech, dubbed “The Great American Comeback,” was criticized by the left even before it was given, including E&E News:
In his past speeches to Congress, Trump has ignored climate change and the environment, instead touting his administration’s regulatory rollbacks and focus on the fossil fuel industry. That’s likely to continue, although Trump’s tone has changed in recent months to mirror the evolving rhetoric on climate from Republicans on Capitol Hill. The president in the past has variously called climate change a “hoax” and suggested that it could be reversed. More recently, he’s continued to mock and mislead about climate science in some settings, but in others he has connected climate change to flooding and called it “a very serious subject.”
But the critical report also noted that crude oil production reached 12.2 million barrels per day in 2019, up 1.3 million barrels a day from 2018 and the most in the world. Natural gas production and liquefied natural gas also reached record highs.

Day said that some Democrats had phoned her to say they would not vote for Hillary Clinton because of her extreme pro-abortion stance.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/01/pro-life-democrats-fed-up-with-partys-abortion-extremism/?utm_source=wnd&utm_medium=wnd&utm_campaign=syndicated%5C,breitbart,abortion,right,23.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, has threatened to withdraw support from candidates who would exclude pro-life Democrats from the party.
“We’ve had enough,” Ms. Day told Catholic News Agency (CNA) this week following an encounter with presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg who said he would be willing to live without the support of pro-life voters in order to maintain his total support for abortion-on-demand.
As Breitbart News reported, Buttigieg told Ms. Day that there is no room for the pro-life position in the Democrat Party and that he would never support any restrictions on abortion.
“I am pro-choice, and I believe that a woman ought to be able to make that decision,” Buttigieg said in a Fox News town hall in Iowa when questioned by Day regarding the party’s diversity and inclusion of pro-life people.
In her interview with CNA, Day expressed her dismay over the Democrats’ utter subservience to the abortion industry, noting that pro-life Democrats are simply “fed up.”
These presidential candidates “are so afraid of the abortion lobby” that they will make no room for pro-life Democrats, she said, because “they’re afraid that they’re going to lose all their money and support.”
“I just wanted to know if he [Buttigieg] thought there was room for us in the party. And he doesn’t,” she said.
Ms. Day said that pro-life Democrats need to show more muscle when dealing with the party leadership.
“We need pro-life Democrats all over the country to go to these candidates and ask the question: Do you want pro-life Democrats in the party? Because if not, we won’t vote for you,” she said.
Day also told CNA that Democratic activists are very vocal about their support for abortion but do not faithfully represent the rank-and-file, which is more divided on the issue.
When it comes down to the details of abortion policy, many Democrats cannot be classified as “pro-abortion,” she said.
While many describe themselves as pro-choice, regarding legal abortion for all nine months of pregnancy or the removal of safety regulations of abortion clinics, “when it comes right down to it, most people agree with me,” Day said.
The party’s “abortion extremism,” she said, “is not going to be a good long-term strategy for them.”
Ms. Day had already condemned her party’s radical pro-abortion platform prior to the 2016 presidential elections, which saw pro-abortion Hillary Clinton defeated by Donald Trump.
Day said that some Democrats had phoned her to say they would not vote for Hillary Clinton because of her extreme pro-abortion stance.
“This platform’s language just says (to pro-lifers) you are no longer welcome,” Ms. Day said at the time. “This has been the general message pro-life Democrats are receiving across the country.”

"Why did Democrats vote overwhelmingly against a bill that would require infants born alive after abortion to be treated as any other infant born at that gestational age? Because abortion is the right to destroy one’s own child, and if a woman chose to kill her baby, to the left it would seem a violation of her so-called right to choose for doctors to try to save that baby.",,federalist,abortion,right,23.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"Conservative commentator and pro-life advocate Ben Shapiro said, in a recent podcast episode, that he’s stumped about why Democrats voted overwhelmingly against passage of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.
“I’ve literally been trying all night and this morning…I’ve been trying to find why exactly Democrats object to this bill,” he said. “What in the world does women’s health have to do with a baby that’s born alive?” he asked with regard to Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s tweet on the bill. “That’s fully crazy.”
Shapiro’s focus is on how propaganda from abortion advocates doesn’t match up with reality. While this is important to point out, he seems to be taking them at their word, as if what they say is what they truly believe. But this arc of thought will fly right over the truth, because abortion propaganda was always meant to obscure the reality of abortion, not justify it.
All Abortions Are Elective
To get to the real rationale behind the abortion entitlement, one must first consider the fact that there is legitimately no medical reason, ever, to have an abortion . There are reasons to separate the baby from the mother through early delivery, and those early deliveries sometimes result in the baby’s death, but “women’s health” is never a legitimate medical reason to deliberately kill a preborn baby.
This means all abortions are elective . All of them. As I wrote recently at The Federalist:
[The abortion entitlement] was never about a woman’s right to ‘choose what to do with her own body,’ or even about her ability to use lethal force against an ‘intruder’ in her body. As Zupan noted, ‘If this was about bodily autonomy there’d be some concern about viable babies.’ Yet there is zero distinction under Vermont law between a 6-week post-conception baby and a 40-week post-conception baby. …The resistance of Democrats to the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act , as well as Virginia Gov. Northam’s now-infamous comments about would-be aborted babies born alive, is further evidence that ‘the party of science’ wants to guarantee women the right to kill their own children simply because they are unwanted, not that they want to guarantee their access to ‘health care.’
Abortion is a pregnant woman employing lethal means to terminate her responsibilities as a mother. It is not an effort to protect “women’s autonomy” or “women’s health.” This is the entitlement leftists are cowing the rest of their party into supporting unconditionally.
Again, if a mother is dangerously ill because of her pregnancy, the baby can be delivered. If a mother can’t bear the responsibility of parenting, she can carry her baby to term then allow her to be adopted. Gestating a baby is not a violation of autonomy, but a natural possible outcome of sex, an act between autonomous and consenting individuals.
The only time one can say pregnancy violates autonomy is if a woman becomes pregnant by rape––but even then, the child is innocent in the matter. As a human being, he is endowed by his Creator with a right to not be murdered, and that natural right supersedes the loss of autonomy for nine months. Moreover, abortions in cases of rape are estimated to constitute about 0.54 percent of all abortions and can’t be used to justify the other 99.46 percent of abortions that leftists staunchly support.
Given that the standard pro-abortion propaganda bears maybe a 0.5 percent resemblance to reality, why did Democrats vote overwhelmingly against a bill that would require infants born alive after abortion to be treated as any other infant born at that gestational age? Because abortion is the right to destroy one’s own child, and if a woman chose to kill her baby, to the left it would seem a violation of her so-called right to choose for doctors to try to save that baby.
Further evidence that this is the real reason can be found in the left’s growing fear of artificial womb technology , which may at some point in the future push back significantly viability outside the natural womb . “My body, my choice,” or the right to not be a “gestational parent,” would no longer automatically conflated with the right to not be “a legal or genetic parent.”
The facade is crumbling, and abortion advocates worry the public might realize that abortion and infanticide are essentially the same. After all, the “magic birth canal” was never a serious belief among true believers in the abortion entitlement. As one newspaper editor said years ago when rebuking a reporter for stating that late-term abortionists “crush skulls and bones,” “As far as I’m concerned, until that thing is born, it is really no different from a kidney; it is part of the woman’s body.”
To speak accurately and precisely about what happens in late-term abortions, he said, “is really to distort the issue.”
The Tacit Endorsement of Infanticide
Make no mistake: getting hung up on what is clearly dissemblance is exactly what spins non-leftists in circles when confronted with the tacit endorsement of infanticide. The left has, until recently, largely upheld this false distinction between a baby in the womb and a baby in the open air to make others more comfortable with the abortion agenda, to give some assurance beyond their word that legal abortion won’t lead to legal infanticide. If “the line” isn’t at birth, where does one draw it? Who can’t be killed?
We swallowed this nasty bit of philosophizing and now its purveyors, or the ideological offspring of its purveyors, are shamelessly going back on their word. If we cling to this distinction as if it were meant sincerely, we won’t be able to address our newly unveiled reality.
I say “unveiled,” because the idea that unwanted children can be murdered or left to die is thousands of years old. Citizens of ancient Rome would leave an unwanted child out to die by exposure, but crude forms of abortion were in practice, too. They stemmed from the same wicked belief that a parent has the right to kill his offspring, whether due to deformity, uncertain paternity, or even because the child might have been more of a drain on the household than a help.
The Twelve Tables of Roman Law contained the command that, “A dreadfully deformed child shall be quickly killed.” Aristotle wrote that, “As to exposing or rearing the children born, let there be a law that no deformed child shall be reared,” and the Stoic philosopher Seneca, too, thought that it was reasonable to drown “weakly” children.
Leftists like Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, the Vermont state representatives who just passed the nation’s most permissive abortion law, or Sen. Patty Murray and the other Democrats who voted against protecting aborted infants born alive, are simply carrying on a millennia-long tradition of depriving children of their rights as human beings and image bearers of God.
Here’s your answer, Shapiro: In the womb or out, the far left believes it’s the mother’s decision whether to allow her own child, her helpless and dependent flesh-and-blood offspring, to live. Expect to see more obstruction of protections for live infants, because Democrats don’t believe in their own propaganda. They believe something far, far more terrible.","['destroy', 'kill', 'so-called']"
Several medical and advocacy groups have insisted abortion services should be considered as essential health care during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and not subject to delays or a reduction of availability that will affect other health services.,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/20/lobby-insists-abortions-must-continue-unabated-during-coronavirus-crisis/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,abortion,right,24.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Several medical and advocacy groups have insisted abortion services should be considered as essential health care during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and not subject to delays or a reduction of availability that will affect other health services.
Noting that some health systems “are implementing plans to cancel elective and non-urgent procedures to expand hospitals’ capacity to provide critical care” to victims of the crisis, a joint statement by several health organizations has urged that abortion providers should be exempt from such cutbacks.
A “Joint Statement on Abortion Access During the COVID-19 Outbreak” was issued Wednesday by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology, together with the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists, the American Gynecological & Obstetrical Society, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society of Family Planning, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.
“While most abortion care is delivered in outpatient settings, in some cases care may be delivered in hospital-based settings or surgical facilities. To the extent that hospital systems or ambulatory surgical facilities are categorizing procedures that can be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion should not be categorized as such a procedure,” the statement declares.
“Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care,” the statement insists. “It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible.”
The statement echoes a similar appeal by the National Abortion Federation (NAF), which “calls on leaders to ensure that outpatient abortion clinics can remain open and urges hospitals to continue to provide abortion care” even while other medical services are reduced or suspended.
According to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), a surgery “may be deemed urgent and necessary if the treating physician decides that a months-long delay would increase the likelihood of significantly worse morbidity or prognosis for the patient.”
In Wednesday’s joint statement, the group of signatories declare that they “do not support COVID-19 responses that cancel or delay abortion procedures,” while adding that community-based and hospital-based clinicians “should consider collaboration to ensure abortion access is not compromised during this time.”

Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,24.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.","['dangerous', 'amounts']"

The Green New Deal has earned the support of a number of Democratic 2020 presidential candidates. Its backers say the ambitious concept is designed to tackle income inequality and climate change by eliminating much of the fossil fuel consumption in the United States and would most likely require tax increases.
Ocasio-Cortez has described the deal as a “life and death” issue. She has not addressed the AFL-CIO letter.
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said last week that unions were not consulted before the plan was released in February.
“Look, we need to address the environment. We need to do it quickly,” he said, the Washington Post reported. “But we need to do it in a way that doesn’t put these communities behind and leave segments of the economy behind. So we’ll be working to make sure that we do two things: that by fixing one thing we don’t create a problem somewhere else.”
Sen. John Barrasso, R- Wyo., tweeted a copy of the letter Monday, saying “I agree with the AFL-CIO.”

Kennedy Jr. a ‘vaccine czar’ without any confirmed details.
For a fleeting moment on Tuesday, the political universe was kumbayaing in mutual disgust at Donald Trump’s meeting with Robert Kennedy Jr. Over the past few decades, RFK Jr.’s famous name has helped him get in the door to talk to important people, and it probably isn’t long before the person who is all jacked up to meet a Kennedy realizes the guy is totally cray-cray. Like most lucky-spermers, RFK Jr. pushes a number of environmental causes and gets really huffy when you ask him about his private jet use.
But it’s RFK Jr’s conspiracy theories about childhood vaccines that raise the ire of pretty much all thinking people, regardless of political affiliation. You can read more about him here and here, but the bottom line is that RFK Jr. is hard-peddling the scary and unscientific connection between vaccines and autism. Here’s just one typical comment from him: “They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.”
So it was with collective alarm that Trump Tower-watchers learned RFK Jr. was meeting with our next president. The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children.
What A Great Opportunity to Raise My Profile
Anti-vaccine activism is not without consequences; parents are refusing to vaccinate their children in higher numbers. For the first time in years, outbreaks of measles and whooping cough are being reported as the needed “herd immunity” is compromised, jeopardizing the health of infants and ill children.
Much of this health hazard lies at the feet of folks like RFK Jr., so the idea that Trump was doing the anti-vax slow-jam with this quack a week before Inauguration Day understandably put Twitterverse over the edge (okay, pretty easy to do). Conservatives and liberals joined virtual hands to denounce the meeting, and RFK Jr. did little to ease fears about his future role in the new administration. “President-elect Trump was very thoughtful,” Kennedy told media after the meeting. “He asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety.”
Ka-boom. Social media and the press went nuts. Major media outlets that lament the influence of fake news on an ignorant (Republican) electorate again sacrificed fact for clicks. USA Today’s headline blared: “Trump asks vaccine skeptic RFK Jr. to lead study on vaccine safety.” Time.com: “Why Donald Trump’s Choice of RFK Jr. as Vaccine Czar is a Terrible Idea.” Twitter moments led with this for a while: “RFK Jr. will chair vaccination safety committee for Trump.”

On Trump's and RFK Jr.'s dangerous, stupid anti-vaxxer bulls*** https://t.co/k1kAvf5Y5z — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) January 10, 2017
The topper—get ready for your shocked face—was from The New York Times. The paper of record’s headline was bad enough—“Trump Asks Critic of Vaccines to Lead Vaccine Safety Panel”—but the article was even worse: “Mr. Trump on Tuesday asked a prominent anti-vaccine crusader to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity, ushering debunked conspiracy theories about the dangers of immunization into the White House.”
So without verification from the Trump transition team, The New York Times posted an ominous article about how anti-vaccine nuts will soon be taking over the West Wing. And they took the word of the one Kennedy people actually run away from, not towards begging to autograph the latest Kennedy coffee table book about Appalachia.
How About a Lil’ Factchecking
Had any of the news outlets waited just a few hours, here’s what the Trump transition team said about the RFK Jr. meeting: “The President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas. The President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on Autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. The President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of Autism with many groups and individuals.”

Now, to be fair, there is a perfectly good chance Trump floated the idea to Kennedy and, once the Trump team saw the huge backlash on social media, walked it back. That’s not a new maneuver in presidential politics. Yet the media should have checked it out before reporting it as fact and even going so far as to call RFK Jr. a “vaccine czar” without any confirmed details.
Let me be clear. Trump should not, for any reason, have met with Robert Kennedy Jr. I hope and pray some smart people in the administration will quickly educate Trump about the truth about vaccines and forcefully dissuade him from making any future statements not based in evidence. But the media’s behavior is just as bad. Making up headlines and legitimizing a publicity-seeking loon like RFK Jr. because it feeds your confirmation bias about Trump can do real and lasting damage.",['cray-cray']

Speaking to reporters from Davos, Switzerland, where more than 3,000 dignitaries and business leaders are meeting his week for the annual World Economic Forum, Trump declined to replicate her father’s criticism of the 17-year-old activist.
“I’m not going to criticize anyone who’s bringing their energy and voice,” she said. “That’s not my style. I think she’s elevated awareness and that’s a positive thing.”
Her remarks came after Thunberg lambasted business and political elites gathered at WEF Tuesday for not doing enough to tackle climate change, warning that time was running out.
“We need to start listening to the science, and treat this crisis with the importance it deserves,” said Thunberg, just as President Trump was arriving in Davos, where he later gave a speech.
“I wonder, what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing the climate chaos you knowingly brought upon them?” she said, according to The New York Times.
Thunberg made international headlines after a fiery speech at the United Nations in September where she scolded business and political elites on climate change.
“My message is that we will be watching you,” she said. “This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here, I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you.”

Since the Democrat Congress and the Obama administration orchestrated the government takeover of student loans in 2010 the total amount of student loan debt has exploded.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/10/rep-andy-barr-on-1-5-trillion-student-loan-debt-congress-created-crisis/,breitbart,student-debt,right,24.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday that Congress created the $1.5 trillion student loan debt crisis affecting 45 million Americans.
Barr asked one of the witnesses, Jason D. Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a series of questions about the companies that issue federal student loans.
“Some of your colleagues on the panel seem to be blaming the student loan servicing industry for the $1.5 trillion student loan crisis in this country,” Barr said.
“Do student loan servicers advise students as to which school to attend or which degree to pursue?” Barr asked.
“No,” Delisle said. “The servicer isn’t involved in the front end of the loan dispersant at all.”
“Do student loan servicers set tuition rates?” Barr asked.
“No,” Delisle said.
“Do student loan servicers advise a student as to how much money to borrow?” Barr asked,
“No,” Delisle responded,
“Do student loan servicers underwrite student loans at origination?” Barr asked.
“No,” Delisle said.
Barr then asked if these servicers “actually issue debt to students?” And whether they “set the terms of the loan?”
“No,” Delisle answered both questions.
Barr asked if they set the loan interest rate or “create the income-based repayment plan.”
“No,” Delisle said.
“Who did that?”
“Congress did and the Department of Education,” Delisle said,
“Did they create the graduated repayment plan?” Barr asked.
“It’s in statute, so Congress,” Delisle said.
Barr went on to lay out the case that student loan debt has become even worse since Barack Obama was president:
Since the Democrat Congress and the Obama administration orchestrated the government takeover of student loans in 2010 the total amount of student loan debt has exploded. The federal government is now the largest consumer lender and owns or guarantees 92 percent of the more than $1.5 trillion in student loans.
“The remaining roughly $100 billion are private loans,” Barr said.
“The number of federal student loan borrowers has exploded by 50 percent since the government takeover,” Barr said. “At the end of 2018, 70 percent of college students graduated with student loan debt.”
Barr went on to say:
Private loans, in contrast, with underwriting standards that actually involve underwriting that allows lenders to determine whether or not a borrower has the ability to repay have a repayment rate of 98 percent. Meanwhile data from the Federal Reserve suggests that approximately 20 percent of federal borrowers are either seriously delinquent or in default.
Barr asked Delisle about the difference between private loans and federal loans and got a stunning answer.
“Federal loans are open access,” Delisle said. “So, for example, if you lose your job and become unemployed you become an excellent candidate for a federal student loan.”
“I think all of this is Exhibit A of not just the total incompetence of the federal government but the victimization of students by Congress, by the federal government, by the U.S. Department of Education,” Barr said.
“I know everyone wants a boogeyman,” Barr said. “And the student loan servicers are a convenient boogeyman.”
“But guess what? Look in the mirror Congress,” Barr said. “Congress created this crisis.”
Barr said the federal government “gave loans to students and didn’t even care whether or not they had the ability to repay.”
“Meanwhile, we have a dramatic shortage in the skilled trades,” Barr said. “We have a dramatic shortage of nurses. We have a dramatic shortage of welders.”
Barr said that rather than scapegoat an industry that is just following laws created by Congress, they should be helping young people get good-paying jobs through a trade training education.
“Let’s graduate these people with $100,000 a year jobs with no student debt,” Barr said. “That might be a better solution than trying to blame an industry that’s just following federal law created by Congress.”
The other witnesses at the hearing shared story after story about how Americans are struggling to pay off student loans, with many having to delay getting married, buying a home, and having children.
“Last year more than one million borrowers defaulted on a student loan,” Seth Frotman, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center said at the hearing. “That’s more than the population of each of your districts.”
“In fact, every 28 seconds another borrower defaults,” Frotman said. “That’s every 28 seconds of every hour, every day, every week, every year.”
Frotman called the student loan debt crisis “a trillion-dollar black hole.”

The argument that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state salves left-wing Christians' consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/woman-who-killed-baby-over-maternity-leave-proves-welfare-wont-fix-abortion/?fbclid=IwAR2SBE3O9KtpsqJvMCIeSlk4Zeqn3oexJevVoXUhDpKszW_VHrTEMBiewaw,federalist,abortion,right,24.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”
This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.
This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.
The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.
Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.
The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”
This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.
This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.
I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.
Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.
In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.
Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.
Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.
It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.","['pro-abortion', 'politicians']"

The president was joined by border patrol agents and other immigration enforcement officials for the briefing, asking them to make their case to the American people for more border security and the wall.
“Without a very strong form of barrier — call it what you will — but without a wall, you cannot have border security,” Trump declared. “It won’t work.”
Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, was present with the president and defended the idea of a wall.
“I promise you that if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work,” Judd said, thanking the president for standing up for border security.
Judd recalled working in Naco, Arizona where illegal immigration drug smuggling was extremely difficult until physical barriers were built.
“Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked,” he said. “They have been an absolute necessity for Border Patrol agents in securing the border.”
Other agents from the National Border Patrol Council included Paul Perez, Alberto Trevino, Hector Garza, and Arturo Del Cueto.
“We are all affected by this shutdown. We have skin in the game,” Del Cueto said. “However, it comes down to border security and we are extremely grateful to President Trump, and we fully support what he is doing to take care of our nation’s borders, to take care of the future of this United States.”
Chris Crane, the president of the National ICE Council and Leann Mezzacapo, the executive vice president, also joined the president.
Trump said that he would continue fighting for more border security, despite Democrats taking the House majority in Congress. He dismissed Democrat calls for more drones and sensors to help monitor the border.

The story has become a viral sensation on Chinese social media as the public awaits the results of an investigation.
According to the South China Morning Post’s summary, the girl’s pet dog scratched her on the finger and she received a rabies shot after her father took her to the hospital. Medical staff cautioned her father she might run a mild fever after the vaccination, but instead she developed an uncontrollable fever overnight and died the following afternoon.
The family agreed to an autopsy and also asked for the vaccine to be examined along with medical records and hospital surveillance camera footage. Guangzhou Promise Biological Products, a company with no previous record of vaccine problems, reportedly produced the vaccine.
The Chinese government has been attempting to restore public trust in the pharmaceutical industry after a series of vaccine scandals by greatly increasing the financial penalties for malpractice. The new rules would allow families to demand compensation in the event of sickness or death after immunization.
One of the recent vaccine debacles occurred in Jiangsu province at the beginning of the year when 145 children were given expired polio vaccinations. The Chinese government pledged an intensive nationwide probe to eliminate incompetence and corruption.
Parents alarmed by the case began investigating their children’s vaccination history and found the government gave them expired doses for diseases other than polio. Parents held rare public demonstrations as fears of a government cover-up grew, driven by a history of vaccine problems turning out to be much worse than Chinese officials originally admitted, combined with the government’s tendency to suppress popular discontent and suppress those who ask awkward questions.","['improperly-handled', 'ominous']"
"The damages bankruptcy inflicts on debtors looks appealing to the twenty percent who say they’ll be in debt until they die. Obama’s proposed change could start a run that would greatly increase costs to the federal government and, by extension, taxpayers.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/03/10/obama-considers-allowing-student-loans-to-be-wiped-out-in-bankruptcy/,breitbart,student-debt,right,25.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Obama has ordered the Department of Education and its network of federal agencies to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
The White House unveiled a “Student Aid Bill of Rights” on Tuesday, declaring every 18-year-old in America—regardless of ability or interest—must be granted access to a college education, must borrow money from the government to finance that education on a payback plan set by the government, and must be “treated fairly” by government debt collectors. Obama instructed federal agencies to “[clarify] the rights of Federal student loan borrowers in bankruptcy” and consider “possible changes to the treatment of loans in bankruptcy proceedings and when they were borrowed under fraudulent circumstances.”
With forty million Americans holding outstanding student loans worth $1.3 trillion, the White House’s proposal is fraught with difficulties.
On one hand, naive teenagers who signed off their financial futures to leftist, anti-American institutions would catch a break. The college cartel screwed you; now here’s a government waiver to make you forever grateful to the Democrats. The ferocity with which federal agencies pursue cancer patients and even Americans who already paid off their balance is disturbing.
On the other hand, the mad push to make college “affordable” has led to a relaxation of lending standards that makes the lead-up to the 2008 housing bubble look responsible. Minimal credit checks, no estimate of future earnings, no estimation of the job market four years down the road, and sometimes no co-signer—none of these impede many Americans from getting a loan.
The damages bankruptcy inflicts on debtors looks appealing to the twenty percent who say they’ll be in debt until they die. Obama’s proposed change could start a run that would greatly increase costs to the federal government and, by extension, taxpayers.
Currently, in order to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, a debtor must prove in court they will never be able to afford their monthly payments. That’s difficult to prove even for borrowers like pancreatic cancer victim Stacy Jorgensen, who was told by collectors from the Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) that the “mere possibility of recurrence is not enough” to allow her to discharge her debt as she underwent chemotherapy. (The survival rate for pancreatic cancer hovers between 19 and five percent.)
Democrats effectively nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 by transferring eight million loans into the federal government’s hands. Republicans claim that higher interest rates students pay on their debts will fund Obamacare to the tune of $8.7 billion, while the mainstream media charges that’s a lie.
Rather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government. Earlier this year, Obama raised the maximum amount students could borrow in Pell Grants another $1,000. His administration also streamlined the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), making it easier to borrow money from the government—which is also over $18 trillion in debt, a 70 percent increase since Obama took office in 2009. In June 2011, Obama issued an executive order that allowed five million debtors to cap their monthly payments to the government at 10 percent of their income—and see their loans forgiven in 20 years.
Obama’s memorandum may encourage more Americans to take on student loan debt instead of deflating the higher education bubble.

Greg Abbott (R) over his ban on the procedure during the coronavirus pandemic in order to preserve medical supplies for healthcare personnel who are treating victims of the infection.
“There are people in Texas who need an abortion today. Now,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, reported the Hill. “They cannot wait a delay of 30 days or even less.”

“Abortion, which is an essential, time-sensitive medical service cannot be delayed,” McGill Johnson said in a press statement. “A global pandemic is not some kind of opening to attack abortion. Gov. Abbott and anti-abortion activists nationwide are forcing a legal and political fight in the middle of a public health crisis.”

However, Dr. Christina Francis, the chair of the board of the American Association of Prolife OB/GYNs (AAPLOG) says moving forward with abortions during the coronavirus pandemic is “medically irresponsible,” at a time when medical equipment is much needed to treat those who are sick.
“Abortions use up much-needed resources such as masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment,” Francis recently told LifeSiteNews.
Francis’s organization is one of five groups of physicians that, collectively, represent over 30,000 doctors and medical professionals who are condemning the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ (ACOG) representation of abortion as essential health care.
The coalition of medical groups said in a statement:
In such an uncertain and tumultuous time, the entire healthcare profession is being called upon to conserve resources and healthcare professionals to an extent never seen before. And yet, in the midst of this call, while hospitals are postponing elective procedures and many outpatient clinics are rescheduling non-essential office visits, the abortion industry continues with business as usual.
The coalition of physicians’ groups further states:
Elective abortion is neither “essential” nor “urgent,” but it does consume critical resources such as masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment, and unnecessarily exposes patients and physicians to pathogens.
The doctors note that continuing abortions – some of which are likely to develop complications – place greater stress on a healthcare system that is under tremendous pressure at the current time:
Most abortion providers instruct women to go to an emergency room if they have any concerning symptoms after the abortion. Approximately 5% of women who undergo medication abortions will require evaluation in an emergency room, most commonly for hemorrhage. Surgical abortions can also result in hemorrhage. Emergency room personnel – who are already struggling to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic – will be further strained to provide care to these women.
We must work together as Texans to stop the spread of COVID-19 & ensure that our health care professionals & facilities have all the resources they need to fight the virus. Those who violate @GovAbbott's order will be met with the full force of the law.https://t.co/B5agHEh3Jq — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) March 23, 2020
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton confirmed Monday Abbott’s order halting abortions during this time:
“[A]ll licensed health care professionals and all licensed health care facilities shall postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.” This prohibition applies throughout the State and to all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary, including routine dermatological, ophthalmological, and dental procedures, as well as most scheduled healthcare procedures that are not immediately medically necessary such as orthopedic surgeries or any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.
“We always knew the abortion industry really didn’t care about women’s health, but this lawsuit proves it again,” said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins:
Leaders in Texas and other states have called for abortion vendors to cease operations so that life-saving equipment can be used to address the coronavirus crisis. But as the rest of the country fights to save lives, Planned Parenthood runs to court to end lives.
Dr. James Dobson, president of the James Dobson Family Institute, praised Abbott and Gov. Mike DeWine (R) of Ohio for stopping abortions in the midst of the current crisis and called on other governors to do the same.
“Our nation and our world are in the midst of a pandemic that is claiming thousands of lives, and the U.S. is taking drastic measures to protect people during this unprecedented time,” he added, and he asked, “So why are abortionists seeking to operate business as usual?”","['tremendous', 'pressure']"
"Americans Need To Stop Hurrying Young People Into Student Debt Slavery. Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,26.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.","['Slavery', 'quagmire']"

Kennedy Jr., reports Insider.com.
For about five years, between 2006 and 2011, HuffPo was a hotbed bed of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorizing. I remember this well because back in those days, when I ran this site’s Big Hollywood vertical, our contributors regularly responded to this madness.
The whole anti-vaxx (as it became known) thing was nuts, a way for fading celebrities to pretend to be the vanguard of a Great Cause that Saved The Children from a sinister government conspiracy. The destructive narcissism on display as they held themselves up as America’s brave truth-tellers was as nauseating as watching them virtue-signal their way into the spotlight.
Bill Maher, Jessica Biel, Charlie Sheen, Kirstie Alley, Selma Blair, Rob Schneider, Erin Brockovich, Juliette Lewis, and, before he became president, even Donald Trump, all helped to spread this nonsense.
By 2015, Republicans like Chris Christie and Rand Paul were flirting with it.
The idea behind the conspiracy is that these miracle vaccines — and they are medical miracles — can cause autism, when there is no data to back that up.
Nevertheless, HuffPo, with its open forum that allowed anyone to publish pretty much anything, especially if that person’s celebrity made founder Arianna Huffington look connected and plugged in, took what was a harmless groups of celebutard quacks and weaponized them into the mainstream. Suddenly the lunacy of not having your child immunized became an act of being down with Playboy Playmate Jenny McCarthy’s struggle.
And now, as was expected, America is dealing with a serious measles outbreak.
Did you know that 19 years ago we completely eradicated measles in this country?
With the return of this disease, what had been working just fine — a sensible opt-out policy that still kept vaccination rates high enough to protect what is known as herd immunity — is now, by necessity, becoming yet another coercive government program.
For example, earlier this month, New York repealed its religious exemptions for vaccinations.
You see, once upon a time, before the Huffington Post decided to treat Jim Carrey like a Big Thinker, it was not necessary to force everyone to get immunized. If the immunization rate is somewhere around 90 percent, that’s good enough, and this ten percent leeway (that’s a ballpark figure) allowed for parents to opt-out based on religious, philosophical, or medical concerns.
These opt-out opportunities, which varied state-by-state, were able to hit the perfect American sweet spot — that spot between public safety and the individual conscience.
But after a bunch of cynical preeners jumped on the bandwagon, that sweet spot is probably going to have to close even more. Even California has had to clamp down.
Also unfortunate is the fact that a major left-wing publication has now been shamed into memory-holing dozens of opinion pieces. But that is only the fault of Arianna Huffington and the Huffington Post, who could have and should have handled this debate more responsibly at the time. No one wants any debate shamed out of existence, but here we are…
Back in 2015, in a piece critical of Christie and Paul, I warned: “If you want the government to truly mandate vaccinations, keep feeding these anti-vaxx conspiracies. Once the anti-vaxx movement grows in size to where immunization rates drop to dangerous levels, the government will definitely step in.”

"It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/woman-who-killed-baby-over-maternity-leave-proves-welfare-wont-fix-abortion/?fbclid=IwAR2SBE3O9KtpsqJvMCIeSlk4Zeqn3oexJevVoXUhDpKszW_VHrTEMBiewaw,federalist,abortion,right,26.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”
This sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.
This argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.
The Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.
Her ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.
The author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”
This shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.
This is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.
I am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.
Looking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.
In contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.
Bearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.
Of course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.
It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.","['stingy', 'violently', 'disposed', 'killed', 'commodity']"

Consider the following parallels:
‘Sustainable’ Agriculture
Green New Deal: “It is the duty of the Federal Government to … [invest] in sustainable farming.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “The State shall promote sustainable agriculture…”
Education
Green New Deal: ‘A Green New Deal will require … providing resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States, with a may be full and equal participants in the Green New Deal mobilization.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Environmental education is obligatory in the various levels and modes of the education system…”
Markets
Green New Deal: “…ensuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “[T]he State shall be required to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the harmful and restrictive effects of monopoly, abuse of a position of dominance and a concentration of demand…”
Heath Care
Green New Deal: “…providing all people of the United States with … high-quality health care.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Health is a fundamental social right and the responsibility of the State, which shall guarantee it as part of the right to life.”
Housing
Green New Deal: “…providing all people of the United States with… affordable, safe, and adequate housing”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Every person has the right to adequate, safe and comfortable, hygienic housing, with appropriate essential basic services.”
Clean Environment
Green New Deal: “…providing all people of the United States with… clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.
Venezuelan Constitution: “Everyone has the right, individually and collectively, to enjoy a safe, healthful and ecologically balanced life and environment.”
Social Costs of Human Activity
Green New Deal: “…ensuring that the Federal Government takes into account the complete environmental and social costs and impacts of emissions…”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Any activities capable of generating damage to ecosystems must be preceded by environmental and socio-cultural impact studies.”
No Emissions
Green New Deal: “…to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “It is a fundamental duty of the State, with the active participation of society, to ensure that the populace develops in a pollution-free environment.”
Guaranteed Jobs
Green New Deal: “…guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “All persons have the right and duty to work. The State guarantees the adoption of the necessary measures so that every person shall be able to obtain productive work providing him or her with a dignified and decorous living and guarantee him or her the full exercise of this right.”
Workplace Safety
Green New Deal: “…strengthening and enforcing labor, workplace health and safety, antidiscrimination, and wage and hour standards across all employers, industries, and sectors.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “Every employer shall guarantee employees adequate safety, hygienic and environmental conditions on the job.”
Unions
Green New Deal: “…strengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “All employees in both public and the private sector have the right to voluntary collective bargaining and to enter into collective bargaining agreements…”
Trade Policy
Green New Deal: “…enacting and enforcing trade rules, procurement standards, and border adjustments with strong labor and environmental protections.”
Venezuelan Constitution: “The State reserves to itself the use of trade policy to protect the economic activities of public and private Venezuelan enterprises.”
Indigenous Populations
Green New Deal: “…obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples for all decisions that affect indigenous peoples and their traditional territories, honoring all treaties and agreements with indigenous peoples, and protecting and enforcing the sovereignty and land rights of indigenous peoples…”
Venezuelan Constitution: “It shall be the responsibility of the National Executive, with the participation of the native peoples, to demarcate and guarantee the right to collective ownership of their lands, which shall be inalienable, not subject to the law of limitations or distrait, and nontransferable, in accordance with this Constitution and the law. “
***
While these many similarities may be just happenstance, the important thing to remember is that Venezuela under its new constitution has become a disaster zone. There is political, economic and social chaos. Those who can are escaping what once was a prosperous nation as fast as they possible.
But that failure probably shouldn’t be so surprising. The reason the Green New Deal and the Venezuelan Constitution are so similar is that their common source is likely a United Nations document called the “International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,” which was passed by the UN General Assembly in 1966 at the behest of the Soviet Union. The UN Covenant itself can be traced back to the Stalin-written Soviet Constitution of 1936.
The words and notions of all these documents may sound good to some, but in the end, they are just empty words at best, a siren call for the naïve, beckoning them to a socialist utopia, and at worst, lip service meant to distract from totalitarian brutality.
But despite more than 100 years of trying over vast swaths of the earth, and more than 100 million deaths and other incalculable miseries caused, it’s become clear that socialists can’t even murder their way to utopia. Their words may sound good, but they inevitably lead to disaster.

That’s the main reason why California has 92 of those 102 confirmed cases. The disease was eliminated in the United States by 2000 but can be brought back and spread via international travelers. All states have rules requiring a measles vaccine for children in public school but some exemptions are allowed. The exemptions are disconcerting to some.
We see stories such as this one from September in The Atlantic: “Wealthy L.A. Schools’ Vaccination Rates Are as Low as South Sudan’s: Hollywood parents say not vaccinating makes ‘instinctive’ sense.” The full story from The Hollywood Reporter is fascinating. More recently we saw this from a local CBS affiliate: “Berkeley’s Measles Ultimatum: 21-Day Quarantine For Unvaccinated Kids If Outbreak Spreads.” BuzzFeed notes that half of the children that attend some Marin County schools north of San Francisco are not vaccinated. The Washington Post notes that the California communities where anti-vaccinators cluster are also the most liberal, voting overwhelmingly for President Obama.
For some reason, many in the media (as well as other liberal commentators) decided to try to make this story about a measles outbreak in California and a concern about vaccination rates in Hollywood, Marin County and Berkeley into an existential problem for — stay with me here because it makes zero sense if you’re not a hack — the Republican Party and conservatives. It’s an odd, perhaps even desperate and clownish, choice. But such is what our political media does these days. See, for example, the completely manufactured and orchestrated “War on Women.”
Here are three obvious but important ways the media demonstrated a disgusting partisan slant instead of good journalism.
1. It is indefensible to spin this as a problem for Republicans.
What got liberals in the media going this week was a statement made by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican:
“Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated, and we think that it’s an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health,” the likely 2016 presidential candidate said while in Cambridge, England. The Republican also noted: “I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.”
Not three days earlier, we had this nearly identical statement from the White House, currently occupied by a Democrat. Nota bene: the President is actually the highest office in the land, even higher than the governor of New Jersey:
""Well, the President certainly believes that these kinds of decisions are decisions that should be made by parents, because ultimately when we’re talking about vaccinations, we’re typically talking about vaccinations that are given to children. But the science on this, as our public health professionals I’m sure would be happy to tell you, the science on this is really clear.""
Both President Obama and Gov. Christie are, in fact, articulating what is state policy in all 50 states. At least to some degree. All 50 states require vaccination and all 50 allow parents to opt-out for medical reasons. All but two allow opt-outs for religious or other reasons. The two that allow no non-medical opt-outs? The super-liberal Democratic states of … oh dear, this doesn’t fit the narrative at all, does it … Mississippi and West Virginia.
Now, outfits such as Mother Jones, Rolling Stone and Salon have all published anti-vaccination pieces in the past decade. The latter two, in fact, published a piece by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. You can probably guess a little something about his political affiliation. But that doesn’t mean that concerns about vaccination are exclusively on the left.
A late January survey by YouGov asked “Do you think early childhood vaccinations can cause autism?” The percentage who responded “definitely” or “probably”: 13% of Democrats, 15% of Independents and 11% of Republicans. It also asked, “When it comes to childhood diseases, like measles, mumps, and whooping cough, should all children be required to get vaccinations or should parents be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children?” More on the inadequacies of this question later, but 70% of Democrats, 48% of Independents and 57% of Republicans said it should be required. The survey asked “Have you received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations?” Republicans were most likely to say yes, at 78%. Democrats and Independents were tied at 69%. Republicans were also most likely to say that they had vaccinated their children, with 88% saying they had, compared to 82% of Democrats with children and 79% of Independents. Finally, Republicans were also more informed about the measles outbreak, with 84% reporting they knew about it compared to 66% of Democrats and Independents. To put it mildly, this is not an issue on which you see a clear partisan divide, particularly not in one particular direction.
But many in our political media — not known for being deep thinkers but known for loving to play gotcha, no matter how little it brings to the discussion — decided that this issue of Berkeley, Marin County and Hollywood parents needed to be jujitsued into a problem for the GOP.
A perfect example comes from Jeremy W. Peters of the New York Times:
The politics of medicine, morality and free will collide as GOP debates itself again over established science: http://t.co/Ofd6v1fTzH
Jeremy W. Peters (@jwpetersNYT) February 3, 2015
Here’s some text from his story. Again, this is the New York Times and not Daily Kos diaries:
Oh for crying out loud. The desperation. Imagine if you got your news only from the New York Times, and how bigoted that would make you against non-liberals.
Anyway, Peters and other groupthinkers went around writing stories about how Republicans have some huge vaccine problem, facts be cast aside. And they went out of their way to ask GOP politicians questions about whether they agreed with this largely universal vaccination approach. But then they framed such agreement in the most nefarious of terms. This was only practiced on GOP politicians, mind you. Not Democrats.
Fun fact about Jeremy W. Peters. I tweeted:
New rule: 100% of journalists must ask 100% of Democrats when science says life begins before uttering the word “vaccine” even one more time
Mollie (@MZHemingway) February 3, 2015
A reader reminded me of a curious historical footnote. A few years ago John McCormack, a reporter for the Weekly Standard, asked Nancy Pelosi, “What is the moral difference between what Dr. Gosnell did to a baby born alive at 23 weeks and aborting her moments before birth?” Now, political journalists know that only pro-life candidates should be on the receiving end of difficult abortion questions. So it’s funny to note what the transcript of this reporter scrum says next (spoiler: Pelosi doesn’t answer the question and no other reporter presses it):
PELOSI: You're probably enjoying that question a lot, I can see you savoring it. [Laughter in press corps] Let me just tell you this.
Who was the reporter in question? It was Peters. Peters bust a gut laughing. Isn’t that so weird? That the same reporter who is making up crap about vaccines being a political problem for Republicans would help out Nancy Pelosi when a single reporter asks her a tough question about her radical abortion stance? That is so weird!
But, yeah, good work each and every one of you reporters who made this fake story something to waste time on this week. You’re all hacks.
2. Hypocrisy in pandemic fear
Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, sore throat and all-over body rash. According to the Washington Post:
Fatalities are rare in the United States, but one or two of every 1,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease, according to Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. More common complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and deafness. Pregnant women who get the measles may give birth prematurely or deliver low-birth-weight babies.
Symptoms of Ebola include, according to the CDC:
Fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal (stomach) pain, unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or bruising).
The fatality rate for Ebola cases from last year is 71%, according to the CDC.
No one wants to get measles, a disease we know a fair bit about and which many Americans of a certain age contracted as children. But it doesn’t even come close to the scare of getting Ebola and having it liquify your organs.
Remember how the media treated Americans who were a bit freaked out about the spread of Ebola? I do. See “Media Should Stop Lecturing Americans About Their Ebola Concerns” and “Media’s ‘Panic Panic’ Is Reaching New Annoying Levels With Quarantines.” The joke of a site PolitiFact even made concerns about Ebola it’s “Lie of the Year.”
You may remember that NBC journalist Nancy Snyderman broke her Ebola quarantine, to the outrage of her neighbors. You will never believe what she tweeted this week:
When free will trumps public health we put our nation's most vulnerable at risk. That doesn't seem very American to me. Vaccinate #measles
Dr. Nancy Snyderman (@DrNancyNBCNEWS) February 3, 2015
Yes, the same woman who broke her Ebola quarantine wrote that tweet.
On that note, remember the media outrage when certain governors took the Ebola threat more seriously than some in the media? It was crazy. Read this link for some of the details, but a nurse who was quarantined by Chris Christie said her human rights had been violated. Various reporters were absolutely outraged that readers didn’t seem to care about this.
But now that you have certain politicians saying it’s important to balance public health programs with concerns about liberty, the media are in full-on panic mode, writing as many stories they can about how Sen. Rand Paul is the world’s greatest threat. Here, for example is how one journalist responded to a tweet by Rand Paul (since deleted and language warning).
Talk about hysteria.
Listen, I’m generally on the side of people who fear bad diseases, whether they’re the liquifying organs kind or the bad rash on your body kind, and whether there’s a widespread vaccine in use against it or not. But could we get some consistency here? A standard other than the “be on the side that hurts Republicans” standard the media are experts in?
3. Defining the terms
NPR had an interesting story four years ago about vaccination and public health threats. Here’s a portion of the discussion with Michael Willrich, author of “Pox: An American History.”
From the very start of the organized vaccination campaign against smallpox, there was public resistance, says Willrich. The battle between the government and the vocal anti-vaccinators came to a head in a landmark 1902 Supreme Court decision, where the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state to order a vaccination for its population during an epidemic to protect the people from a devastating disease. ""But at the same time, the Court recognized certain limitations on that power — that this power of health policing was no absolute and was not total and there was a sphere of individual liberty that needed to be recognized,"" says Willrich. ""Measures like this needed to be reasonable and someone who could make a legitimate claim that a vaccine posed a particular risk to them because of their family history or medical history [would not have to be vaccinated.]"" In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stipulated that a state couldn't forcibly vaccinate its population. ""[They said,] 'Of course, it would be unconstitutional and go beyond the pale for health officials to forcibly vaccinate anyone because that's not within their power,'"" says Willrich. ""And I think that's really a shoutout to the Boston health authorities who were employing forcible vaccination all the time in the poorest neighborhoods in the city.""
Would these court decisions be called “anti-vaxxer,” the media adjective du jour? Consider this tweet from BuzzFeed’s Adam Serwer:
here's a weird CW that anti vaxxers are mostly lefties but it's a ver bipartisan fringe http://t.co/tCtYOnnGdr pic.twitter.com/CotlsRys57
Adam Serwer (@AdamSerwer) February 3, 2015
Leaving aside the idea that 26% to 30% of a group could be described as fringe, what we see is a conflation of opposition to vaccines with opposition to forced government vaccination. Here might be another example.
What does “mandatory” vaccination mean? Does it mean something that allows that the “power of health policing is not absolute” as the Courts might say? Or does it mean we fine and jail parents who choose not to vaccinate their children? Does it mean we take children away from parents who don’t vaccinate? Or does it mean we don’t allow non-vaccinated children in public schools?
Does it matter why parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children? Is it because they have moral objections to using vaccines developed from aborted babies? Is it because their child has medical problems that would be compounded by a vaccine injection? Is it because they’re philosophically opposed to medicine? Is it because they believe discredited studies about a link between autism and vaccines? What lines should be drawn?
I get that the media really want to do some bullcrap horse-race point-scoring partisan sniping right now. But these are actually important questions. And “gotcha” reporting may get you butt-slapped by your fellow reporters at the bar, but it’s actually really dangerous.
Vaccinations are too important to be sucked into a politicized debate and the media should be ashamed for trying so hard to make it so. Vaccines are one of the most agreed-upon topics regardless of political leaning. We already mandate vaccinations in 50 states. Journalistic discussion of whether the exemptions to these mandates are too broad or too narrow is legitimate, even if media panic seems a bit overwrought right now. There is no way that debate goes well if it becomes the media’s next “War on Women” type exercise of water carrying for Democrats.","['bullcrap', 'butt-slapped', 'partisan', 'sniping', 'gotcha', 'dangerous', 'horse-race', 'point-scoring']"
"The government of the secretive central Asian nation Turkmenistan published photos of what it claimed to be thousands of cyclists celebrating World Health Day on Tuesday with a crowded ride through the nation’s capital, Ashgabat – one of several sporting events seemingly held with no concern for the Chinese coronavirus.",https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/04/08/turkmenistan-celebrates-world-health-day-thousands-strong-cycling-event/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,27.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The government of the secretive central Asian nation Turkmenistan published photos of what it claimed to be thousands of cyclists celebrating World Health Day on Tuesday with a crowded ride through the nation’s capital, Ashgabat – one of several sporting events seemingly held with no concern for the Chinese coronavirus.
The Turkmen government also published photos of contact sporting events such as wrestling and martial arts, which most of the world has canceled to prevent the spread of the deadly pathogen originating in central Wuhan, China.
An official statement from the government of dictator Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov celebrated the many “lovers of a healthy lifestyle throughout Turkmenistan who followed” Berdimuhamedov’s example by participating in sports. The president himself spent the day partaking in equestrian sports in Ashgabat’s “Olympic village,” which the regime built despite, as the Asian current affairs publication the Diplomat noted, Turkmenistan never even winning an Olympic medal, much less hosting an Olympic Games.
The government claimed that about 3,500 people took their bicycles on a tour of Ashgabat and that, nationwide, 7,000 people participated in the cycling movement. Judo, boxing, and other combat sport tournaments also allegedly took place. Photos showed men participating in martial arts and thousands of riders of green bicycles zipping between the bright white skyscrapers of Ashgabat.
Berdimuhamedov celebrated the country’s “great successes” in promoting athletics, the government noted. Its statement applauded the dictator for allegedly being an exemplary physical specimen who “regularly trains, runs, rides a bicycle, and drives a sports car and a horse equally brilliantly.”
“At a time when the situation with coronavirus remains tense in many countries of the world, a calm epidemiological situation is ensured in Turkmenistan thanks to timely measures,” the government’s statement read. Turkmenistan is believed to have significantly cracked down on entry into Ashgabat and shut its borders in March to prevent foreigners from bringing in the virus, though Turkmenistan’s dictatorship already strictly limits tourism and travel into the country from abroad.
The statement was a rare mention of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in a country that, according to Reporters Without Borders, is detaining people caught in public discussing the pandemic or wearing medical masks to protect themselves. The journalist organization said that local reporters had evidence of undercover police hiding among crowds on public transit and detaining individuals mentioning the virus. Berdimuhamedov also reportedly banned state media from discussing the coronavirus specifically. The government has instead reportedly distributed vague guidelines on communicable diseases.
The Diplomat cast some doubt on the veracity of the mass sporting events in Ashgabat on Wednesday. Citing dissident media – only state media is legal in Turkmenistan – the outlet noted that photos were circulating of many of the bicycle allegedly used for the cycling event padded together in trucks. Some reports from student groups suggested that they had received notices that the events were canceled.
NBC News noted that state television networks broadcast what they claimed to be footage of the sporting events, allegedly of “hundreds of people wearing identical tracksuits conducting coordinated exercise in close quarters.” NBC did not make any mention of the footage looking old or in any way suspicious. The photos posted on the official Turkmenistan website also did not appear to have any online history prior to being published on the website – not a full confirmation that they are new, but the fact eliminates the possibility that the government recycled photos published in the past of similar events.
NBC also reported that Berdimuhamedov had made at least one other mention of the coronavirus outbreak weeks ago, claiming that a Turkmen herb could cure the disease.
Turkmenistan and China have close diplomatic relations, as Turkmenistan actively participates in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s plan to dominate the world’s most important trade routes. Turkmenistan, in turn, offers China its largest share of natural gas imports.
At press time, Turkmenistan claims to have documented zero cases of Chinese coronavirus in the country.

Transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox twice broke a female opponent’s skull to win matches and now he is being praised by some in the LGBT community.,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/01/22/transgender-mma-fighter-who-fractured-womans-skull-named-bravest-athlete-history/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,27.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"MMA fighter Fallon Fox twice broke an opponent’s skull to win matches and now he is being praised by some in the LGBT community.
Outsports, a sports news website that focuses on LGBT issues in sports, named Fox the “bravest athlete in history” in a recent article written by Cyd Zeigler. Fox, who is a biological male fighting physically weaker females and inflicting life-altering harm, apparently qualifies as brave because, according to Zeigler, “she was the target of a torrent of hatred I have literally never seen targeting an LGBTQ athlete.”
As intense as the “hatred” Fox may have been subjected to, it’s highly unlikely that the social media comments directed his way ever fractured his skull. The title of bravest athlete would have been much more appropriately bestowed on the biological females who dared to enter the cage with a fighter they had no hope of matching in terms of power and athletic ability.
The Post Millennial posted a commentary on Fox and the women he was in the ring with:
Fox, a male to female transgender athlete, destroyed Erika Newsome in a Coral Gables, FL, MMA fight during which she “secured a grip on Newsome’s head… With her hands gripping the back of Newsome’s skull, she delivered a massive knee, bringing her leg up while pulling her opponent’s head down. The blow landed on Newsome’s chin and dropped her, unconscious, face-first on the mat.” That was Newsome’s last pro fight. But to Outsports, a male-bodied person beating a female bodied person unconscious constitutes bravery. Not only has Fox beat up women in the ring, won every match but one, but has weathered online attacks from the likes of Joe Rogan. I think we can all agree that getting back online after Joe Rogan has knocked you down is far braver than facing another male-bodied of your own muscle mass and size in a fight. Fox also beat Tamikka Brents, giving her a concussion and breaking 7 orbital bones. But that’s super brave, too, taking an unfair, male-bodied advantage and using it to give female-bodied opponents brain injuries.
Vice also defended Fox in its account of his career: “Fallon was born with a peen. No one’s perfect. I throw away too much salad. She was raised as a dude, as I am told is traditional in Ohio for babies born with outwardly expressive genitalia. But that peen never did sit right with her and, since 2008, she has been a woman in mind, body, and soul.”
Brents was not told that Fox was trans before she was in the ring with him, the Post Millennial reported.
“I’ve fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night,” Brents said, recounting her experience fighting Fox. “I can’t answer whether it’s because she was born a man or not because I’m not a doctor. I can only say, I’ve never felt so overpowered ever in my life and I am an abnormally strong female in my own right… I still disagree with Fox fighting. Any other job or career I say have a go at it, but when it comes to a combat sport I think it just isn’t fair.”
The Post Millennial report notes that the International Olympic Committee said that it would take treatment for one year prior to competition to level the playing field between transgender men competing against females and females would need “years of hormones” to gain some male advantages.
“There are no cohesive federal laws in the U.S. to determine what makes a male eligible to compete against women, and while males have won women’s championships, female-bodied athletes have not risen to the upper levels of male competition,” the website reported.
Fox told Outsports: “My teammates had no idea I was trans. They recognized my endurance, my strength, my ability to cut weight in the same category as cisgender women. There was no idea in their minds that I didn’t belong. They weren’t thinking, ‘oh my God, she’s going to kill somebody.’”

Kennedy Jr. a ‘vaccine czar’ without any confirmed details.
For a fleeting moment on Tuesday, the political universe was kumbayaing in mutual disgust at Donald Trump’s meeting with Robert Kennedy Jr. Over the past few decades, RFK Jr.’s famous name has helped him get in the door to talk to important people, and it probably isn’t long before the person who is all jacked up to meet a Kennedy realizes the guy is totally cray-cray. Like most lucky-spermers, RFK Jr. pushes a number of environmental causes and gets really huffy when you ask him about his private jet use.
But it’s RFK Jr’s conspiracy theories about childhood vaccines that raise the ire of pretty much all thinking people, regardless of political affiliation. You can read more about him here and here, but the bottom line is that RFK Jr. is hard-peddling the scary and unscientific connection between vaccines and autism. Here’s just one typical comment from him: “They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.”
So it was with collective alarm that Trump Tower-watchers learned RFK Jr. was meeting with our next president. The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children.
What A Great Opportunity to Raise My Profile
Anti-vaccine activism is not without consequences; parents are refusing to vaccinate their children in higher numbers. For the first time in years, outbreaks of measles and whooping cough are being reported as the needed “herd immunity” is compromised, jeopardizing the health of infants and ill children.
Much of this health hazard lies at the feet of folks like RFK Jr., so the idea that Trump was doing the anti-vax slow-jam with this quack a week before Inauguration Day understandably put Twitterverse over the edge (okay, pretty easy to do). Conservatives and liberals joined virtual hands to denounce the meeting, and RFK Jr. did little to ease fears about his future role in the new administration. “President-elect Trump was very thoughtful,” Kennedy told media after the meeting. “He asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety.”
Ka-boom. Social media and the press went nuts. Major media outlets that lament the influence of fake news on an ignorant (Republican) electorate again sacrificed fact for clicks. USA Today’s headline blared: “Trump asks vaccine skeptic RFK Jr. to lead study on vaccine safety.” Time.com: “Why Donald Trump’s Choice of RFK Jr. as Vaccine Czar is a Terrible Idea.” Twitter moments led with this for a while: “RFK Jr. will chair vaccination safety committee for Trump.”

The topper—get ready for your shocked face—was from The New York Times. The paper of record’s headline was bad enough—“Trump Asks Critic of Vaccines to Lead Vaccine Safety Panel”—but the article was even worse: “Mr. Trump on Tuesday asked a prominent anti-vaccine crusader to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity, ushering debunked conspiracy theories about the dangers of immunization into the White House.”
So without verification from the Trump transition team, The New York Times posted an ominous article about how anti-vaccine nuts will soon be taking over the West Wing. And they took the word of the one Kennedy people actually run away from, not towards begging to autograph the latest Kennedy coffee table book about Appalachia.
How About a Lil’ Factchecking
Had any of the news outlets waited just a few hours, here’s what the Trump transition team said about the RFK Jr. meeting: “The President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas. The President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on Autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. The President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of Autism with many groups and individuals.”

Now, to be fair, there is a perfectly good chance Trump floated the idea to Kennedy and, once the Trump team saw the huge backlash on social media, walked it back. That’s not a new maneuver in presidential politics. Yet the media should have checked it out before reporting it as fact and even going so far as to call RFK Jr. a “vaccine czar” without any confirmed details.
Let me be clear. Trump should not, for any reason, have met with Robert Kennedy Jr. I hope and pray some smart people in the administration will quickly educate Trump about the truth about vaccines and forcefully dissuade him from making any future statements not based in evidence. But the media’s behavior is just as bad. Making up headlines and legitimizing a publicity-seeking loon like RFK Jr. because it feeds your confirmation bias about Trump can do real and lasting damage.","['anti-vax', 'slow-jam', 'quack']"

In 2019 the number of migrants attempting to enter the UK illegally by crossing the English Channel surged to 2,358, quadrupling the number of 2018, which saw 586 people attempting the perilous sea journey across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.
French authorities report that 261 migrant filled boats, which are typically undersized, overloaded and ill-equipped to deal with the heavily trafficked and icy waters of the channel, attempted to make the crossing, leading to four deaths last year, reports The Guardian.
Of the total, some 1,892 migrants successfully reached British shores last year, according to The Standard. The figure is twice as many as the year prior, many of whom were brought to Dover by UK Border Force.
The news comes after 43 migrants from Iraq, Iran, and Afganistan were brought to Dover after attempting to cross in three small boats.
Last week, Breitbart London reported that a former immigration chief blamed the surge in migrant crossings on increased border patrols on the channel.
“The more Border Force cutters there are in the Channel the more attractive it is for those setting sail in small boats. They know they will be picked up and taken to the UK. For them that is mission accomplished,” said David Wood, former immigration enforcement at the Home Office.

“When there is an incentive, people will find ways to get here, whether it is in lorries, small boats or any other means. If they know they are going to be promptly returned they will stop coming,” a Home Office spokesman told The Telegraph.
In 2018 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK agreed to pay France £44.5 million to install border fencing and surveillance systems at Calais and other French ports where migrants set sail from. The United Kingdom had previously paid £100 million to France to increase border security.
In October, Breitbart London reported that French police are allegedly actively assisting migrants to avoid detection by UK Border Force, telling them when and when not to attempt to cross the channel, according to a people smuggler.

The BBC traditionally allows high-profile individuals to guest edit during the Christmas period, and the Swedish teen climate change activist will be one of five awarded the honour this year.
With the episode set to be aired between Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve on Radio 4, the BBC said that the child “will speak to the world’s leading climate change figures and hear from frontline activists” and has commissioned reports from the Antarctic and Zambia.
Thunberg has garnered gushing praise from celebrities during her environmental crusade. Leonardo DiCaprio applauded her as a “leader of our time” with feminist author Margaret Atwood calling her the “Joan of Arc of the environment” while Hollywood star Anne Hathaway labelled criticism of the girl’s climate alarmism as “textbook misogyny”.
After crisscrossing the United States to deliver excoriating messages on the environment earlier this year, the Nobel Peace Prize nominee found herself stranded in the Americas after the UN climate summit was moved from Chile to Spain. Refusing normal modes of transport, she finally made it to Madrid in time by hitching another ‘carbon-free’ boat ride across the Atlantic. It is likely she will make another headline-grabbing carbon-neutral trip from her native Sweden to the UK next month.

The public figure, who inspired children around the world to ditch school and join millions of people in the so-called ‘Youth Climate Strike’, called on Facebook last month to silence her critics and threatened to quit the social media platform otherwise.
The teen green prodigy, the daughter of an actor and an opera singer, has come under criticism for focusing her censure on Western countries but largely ignoring number-one polluter China, which accounts for 30 per cent of global emissions.
In perhaps her most notable performance, Thunberg claimed at the UN in September that the adults in the General Assembly had “stolen my dreams and my childhood” for failing to impose restrictive carbon emission targets.
“This is all wrong,” the teen said. “I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?”
She continued: “You have stolen my dreams, my childhood, with your empty words, and yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?”","['Wunderkind', 'gushing', 'crusade', 'praise']"
"Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) immigration plan, which opens the border to all foreign nationals, was drafted by a handful of illegal alien staffers.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/23/daca-illegal-aliens-helped-draft-bernie-sanders-2020-open-borders-plan/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,immigration,right,28.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) immigration plan, which opens the border to all foreign nationals, was drafted by a handful of illegal alien staffers.
A report by the Wall Street Journal reveals that three illegal aliens working for Sanders’ 2020 Democrat presidential primary campaign helped craft the democratic-socialists’ plan to decriminalize illegal immigration, end deportations, and stop federal immigration raids.
All three illegal alien Sanders staffers have been allowed to stay in the U.S. through former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
The Journal notes:
The campaign has a Latino outreach program that spans every early state, and has held specific events tailored to the Latino community in Iowa and California. (California holds its primary on March 3, a month after Iowa. But voters can begin mail-in voting the same day as Iowa.) Of the 542 paid staff on the campaign in the third quarter, at least 70 are Latino, according to the campaign. Three of the staff members who worked on Mr. Sanders’s immigration policy are beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. [Emphasis added]
Despite repeatedly denouncing open borders and its impact on the quality of life, wages, and economic opportunities of America’s working and middle class, Sanders’ 2020 immigration plan endorses policies that end federal immigration enforcement.
Like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sanders is promising to decriminalize illegal immigration to the U.S., making it only a civil violation to cross international borders. Similarly, Sanders has introduced a plan to at least temporarily end raids and deportations by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
As Breitbart News reported in March, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint was filed against Sanders’ campaign for his hiring of the three DACA illegal aliens. The complaint alleges that Sanders’ hiring of foreign nationals for advisory jobs on his campaign equates to foreign election interference.

"First Joe Biden said he still supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions, , then changed his position one day later, after tremendous political pressure from farther-left Democrats.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/13/will-democrats-shut-government-force-taxpayer-funding-abortions/#.XQIyT3A1q5E.twitter,federalist,abortion,right,28.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"With the Hyde Amendment, the real test for Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand, and their fellow Democrats will come in how hard they will push for its repeal.
Last week, the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions, became the focus of presidential politics. First Joe Biden said he still supported the amendment, then changed his position one day later, after tremendous political pressure from farther-left Democrats.
But the press should focus less on whether Democrats support taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand. Virtually all Democrats running for president now support that position, as did the party’s 2016 national platform.
Rhetorically, Democrats sound fully in lockstep with their pro-abortion left. For instance, on Tuesday presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) called a pro-life position “not acceptable,” and equated nominating pro-life judges to “appoint[ing] a judge who’s racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic.” But with the Hyde Amendment, the real test for Biden, Gillibrand, and their fellow candidates will come in how hard they will push for its repeal.
Democrats Don’t Want to Vote on Hyde
For all the focus last week on the Hyde Amendment, named after its prime advocate, the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), reporters have not focused on the Labor-Health and Human Services spending bill that the House of Representatives will consider this week. The committee-approved bill includes the following language:
SEC. 506. (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act, and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated in this Act, shall be expended for any abortion.
In other words, an appropriations bill approved by the Democratic-run House Appropriations Committee still includes the Hyde Amendment language. (Subsequent sections exempt cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother—the Hyde Amendment exceptions—from the funding ban.)
Yet the chairwoman of that Committee, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY), co-sponsored stand-alone legislation (H.R. 1692) repealing the Hyde Amendment protections that she included in her spending bill.
How Far Will They Go?
An appropriations bill lacking Hyde protections on taxpayer funding of abortions holds virtually no chance of becoming law, for several reasons. First, Republicans control the Senate, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will not bring a bill to the Senate floor that lacks the Hyde protections. Early last year, a move to bail out Obamacare failed because Republican leaders would not support additional funding for the law without clear protections on taxpayer funding of abortion, while Democrats would not vote for any measure that included those protections.
Even if Republicans did not control the Senate, 41 pro-life senators could filibuster any measure lacking Hyde Amendment protections, thus preventing the legislation from passing. And of course, President Trump can, and likely would, veto any appropriations bills that omitted pro-life protections on taxpayer funding of abortion.
The likelihood during this Congress of legislation passing that excludes the Hyde Amendment seems infinitesimal. Moreover, such legislation passing during the next Congress could well require 1) a Democrat to win the presidency, 2) Democrats to retake the Senate, and 3) Democrats to agree to end the legislative filibuster, which dozens of them claim they oppose.
This Is All Just Failure Theater
Events in the House this week show that liberal members of Congress are essentially “going through the motions” about repealing the Hyde Amendment. Several of them, led by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), offered an amendment to strike Hyde from the spending bill. However, on Monday the House Rules Committee reported a rule for consideration of the underlying bill that did not make the amendment in order.
Ostensibly, the Democratic leadership did not allow the House to vote on the amendment because the amendment contained authorizing language, which violates House rules prohibiting the addition of unrelated matters on spending bills. But in reality, the House Rules Committee can, and does, waive such procedural restrictions when it wishes to do so. It didn’t here.
Likewise, Pressley could have omitted that authorizing language, and submitted a shorter amendment just striking the Hyde provisions. She did not—and that she did not strongly suggests that she and her colleagues wanted to give the House Rules Committee, and therefore Democratic leadership, an “out” to block consideration of her amendment.
Pressley’s office claimed “the Congresswoman believes that she and her colleagues must use every tool and tactic available to fight for reproductive justice.” But if she wanted to use “every tool and tactic,” she would have drafted an amendment without an obvious procedural flaw giving the leadership political cover to reject it. She and her liberal colleagues would also demand a vote on her amendment, and vote against the rule to consider the bill unless and until Democrats give them one.
Pressley didn’t do the former, and when the vote on the rule came on Tuesday, she and her colleagues didn’t do the latter either. Instead, she cut a deal with the leadership whereby everyone could “save face”—as evidenced by the fact that House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, on the same day he denied her amendment a vote, co-sponsored the stand-alone bill requiring taxpayer funding of abortions.
Flip-Flops Ahead
The “failure theater” in the House this week demonstrates that Democratic presidential candidates currently serving in Congress may soon find themselves in a political bind. Those who criticized Biden for his Hyde Amendment flip-flop—or, as former Obama adviser David Axelrod called it, a “flip-flop-flip”—are going to have to flip on the issue themselves. For instance, Rep. Seth Moulton trolled Biden on Friday, asking him to change his position on the 2003 Iraq war.
In the coming months, however, Moulton will face a flip-flop decision of his own, as will the many other Democratic presidential candidates currently serving in Congress. Will they vote for spending bills that include the Hyde Amendment—as any final appropriations package almost certainly must include its provisions to get enacted into law—even though they claim to support repealing the amendment?
On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) laid the groundwork for just such a reversal. In an interview with CNN, he admitted that “sometimes in a large bill you have to vote for things you don’t like.” (That makes a good argument for Congress to stop passing massive spending bills that they don’t bother to read.)
Of course, if Democrats don’t want to flip-flop on taxpayer funding of abortion, they have another alternative: Refuse to pass any spending bills that include the Hyde Amendment provisions. If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wants to shut the federal government down until Republican lawmakers approve taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand, well, good luck with that. But if she and her Democratic colleagues don’t want to follow that strategy, then they should get ready to explain to their constituents why they voted for legislation that retained the Hyde Amendment after promising to abolish it.
In crass political terms, Biden didn’t help his candidacy by wavering over the Hyde Amendment last week. But even though they may not yet realize it, most of his fellow presidential candidates may soon have their own flip-flop moments on taxpayer funding for abortion.","['tremendous', 'farther-left']"

In the past year, Planned Parenthood performed 345,672 abortions, an increase of nearly 13,000 more abortions and four percent over the 332,757 the group performed during year 2017-2018.
The number of abortions performed in 2017-2018 was 11,373 more than the abortions performed the year before that, a trend that shows that while Planned Parenthood officials once said abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” today they omit the word “rare” in their mantra as they perform more abortions each year.
Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of Planned Parenthood tweeted last week, “Abortion is safe and legal, and we’re doing everything we can to keep it that way”:
Anti-abortion politicians are using every trick in the book to ban abortion. Asking the Supreme Court to reconsider overturning Roe is an assault on our basic rights, plain and simple.

In its analysis of the data, pro-life news outlet Live Action News noted that, in the past decade, “abortions at Planned Parenthood have risen nearly seven percent (6.67%) from 324,008 in 2008 to 345,672 in 2018.
In 2018-2019, the abortion business was also on the receiving end of $616.8 million in American taxpayer funds, a 9.4 percent jump from the $563.8 million it received in year 2017-2018.
“Government health services reimbursements and grants” remains the largest source of income for Planned Parenthood at 37 percent – largely from the Medicaid program – followed by “private contributions and bequests” at 36 percent.
In year 2018-2019, Planned Parenthood’s total revenue was more than $1.6 billion, and its net assets for the year was nearly $2 billion.
Once again, Live Action News observed Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer income over the last decade has risen 69.8 percent, “from $363.2 million in 2008 to $616.8 million in taxpayer dollars in 2018.”
The pro-life organization added:
[Planned Parenthood] has long (and falsely) claimed that abortions make up just three percent of its services, a claim that has been debunked multiple times. Planned Parenthood’s abortion market share currently stands at 40% when compared to the most recent data from the Guttmacher Institute for 2017. That means Planned Parenthood alone commits 40% of all the abortions in the United States. This number may increase after the Guttmacher Institute releases new national abortion statistics.
According to that data, Planned Parenthood’s market share of abortions has increased since 2017, when the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, confirmed Planned Parenthood obtained 35 percent of the U.S. abortion market – a figure that well overtakes the market shares of leaders in other industries.
“The level of market dominance for abortions demonstrated by Planned Parenthood could be taught in business schools as the ultimate example of strategic planning and execution,” wrote CLI President Chuck Donovan and Vice President Dr. James Studnicki. “It is a defining activity.”
The report also observed that Planned Parenthood provided less than 1.4 percent of the nation’s HIV tests and less than 1 percent of pap tests. Additionally, in the previous five years, service-to-client ratios for breast exams and pap tests had declined by 37 percent.
“Severing the link between taxpayers and the abortion conglomerate that is Planned Parenthood has never been more important, because you get more of what you pay for and less of what you tax,” said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America in a statement sent to Breitbart News.
Hawkins observed that Planned Parenthood continues to perform more abortions each year even though the rate of abortions is reported to be at its lowest point in decades.
“Even as the abortion rate is reported to be falling, Planned Parenthood’s share of the abortion business is up, and of course given their political connections, so is their misappropriation of funds from taxpayers,” Hawkins said. “Planned Parenthood should not be able to operate their deadly business on the taxpayers’ dime.”
In contrast to the 345,672 abortions performed in the past year, Planned Parenthood performed only 213,042 well-woman exams (down from 216,722 from the year before).
The organization touts in its newly released annual report that it now provides “services for transgender patients” in 31 states and has performed 4,960,598 services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and treatments.
Planned Parenthood’s annual report is released as more than 200 members of Congress have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to “reconsider” the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that invented a right to abortion, though none ever existed in the Constitution.
“The Trump Administration needs to uphold its promise to pro-life Americans and re-direct all current taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, to community health care centers that practice only non-violent healthcare,” Hawkins said. “Our Healthcare dollars should be invested with those who extend life and end suffering, not kill for a living.”",['abortions']
"Yet the drumbeat for censorship goes on as the politicians whose ideas find favor with the mainstream media want to make sure theirs are the only ideas you ever get to hear. Today it will be about money, but only because money is the means to spread ideas.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/mike-bloombergs-flameout-proves-billions-cant-buy-elections/,federalist,elections-2020,right,28.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Despite recent history proving money can't buy elections, Democrats haven’t changed their tune because the call for 'getting money out of politics' was never about money; it was always about ideas.
Michael Bloomberg spent $500 million this year, and all he got for it was 61 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. That’s 61 out of the 1,397 awarded so far, just over 3 percent of what he would have needed to clinch the nomination. After a disappointing Super Tuesday performance, Bloomberg quit the race, although he promised to spend even more money to influence the primaries still to come.
That $500 million is a nearly unfathomable amount of money to us non-billionaires. It’s not, as MSNBC tried to claim, enough to give each American a million dollars (the real figure is about $1.50 each) but it’s still a ton of money, even to a rich guy, and all of it wasted.
Yet the message from Democrats and the mainstream media remains the same: Rich candidates and rich donors are buying our democracy. Critics of these big spenders should look at the results of the last few years’ elections. If they did, they’d see that times have changed. In this age of social media dominance, money no longer buys elections, if indeed it ever did. Somehow, though, we continue to hear the call for restricting political speech.
A History of Election Spending
The change in the relationship between elections and money has been going on for a while now. There was never an exact correlation, but it used to be more common for the candidate who raised the most money to win the election. Whether that was because people donate more to popular candidates or because more donations helps candidates appear more popular is unclear.
But in 2008, Barack Obama’s record-breaking spending was nearly twice as much as John McCain’s. In 2012, Obama broke his own record, raising $722 million — including outside supporters’ spending, it totaled more than $1 billion. Both times, he outraised and outspent his Republican rivals, and both times he won the election (although outside spending helped Mitt Romney to match Obama’s overall totals).
In 2016, things looked different in many ways, including in campaign fundraising and spending. In the Republican primaries, Jeb Bush was the biggest spender. Between campaign and super PAC funds, he raised $138 million. It netted him four pledged delegates. Four.
Other contenders were not much better. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz spent more than $100 million each. They got more delegates than Bush, but were still well short of a majority, even combined. Ben Carson spent $77 million for all of seven delegates, while Donald Trump spent $76 million and earned 1,457 delegates and the nomination.
If the GOP primaries broke the money-to-votes connection, the general election shattered it further. Hillary Clinton spent more than any Republican to win her nomination: $216 million. That was slightly less, though, than her unsuccessful rival, Bernie Sanders, who spent $220 million.
In the general election, the big money came pouring in. Clinton and outside groups supporting her spent a whopping $769 million dollars, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump and his outside supporters spent $467 million — about 60 percent of Clinton’s total. We all know how that turned out.
Money Can’t Buy Elections
The 2018 midterms showed a similar pattern in some states. In Texas, for example, Robert “Beto” O’Rourke spent 70 percent more than his opponent, Cruz, and still lost. Unbiased observers might have taken the results of those election cycles and adjusted the money-to-votes calculus in their minds.
But in punditry and in politics, it is a sign of weakness to adjust your theories when confronted with new facts. Money buys elections? Get money out of politics. Money doesn’t buy elections? Get money out of politics. The slogan never changes.
The Democratic primaries this year are still ongoing, but already the lessons of 2016 are being reinforced. Bloomberg’s half-billion is the headline, but the second-biggest spender, billionaire Tom Steyer, dropped at least $270 million and is already out of the race. That’s more than Clinton or Sanders spent total in the 2016 primaries. Steyer has zero delegates.
These results are a powerful indication that if the people do not want to vote for someone, no amount of campaign spending will change their minds. Yet looking at the campaign websites of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, you’d think nothing has changed in 10 years. Both campaigns have detailed promises to reduce the ways citizens can participate in election campaigns. Both plans highlight the promise to amend the Constitution to overturn the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC.
What They Really Want
Citizens United has been a bugbear of the left for close to 10 years now, but we hear very little about what the case said or what its verdict meant. Sanders has long been the loudest voice on the issue, but it is not terribly clear what he opposes about the decision. Consider this statement on his campaign website: “Overturn Citizens United, which allows corporations to spend unlimited money on elections.” Is that what’s going on? Are large corporations bankrolling the Trump campaign with “unlimited” spending?
Ignore for the moment the idea of “unlimited money,” something only communists and Washington politicians could think exists. The vagueness of the left’s attacks on Citizens United is intentional because they don’t want you to know that they’re calling for government censorship of political speech. Did that case involve a rich person or rich corporation trying to buy votes? It did not, but you wouldn’t know it from Sanders and Biden.
Citizens United was a small nonprofit corporation that wanted to publish its ideas about a candidate in an election year. Those ideas were contained in “Hillary: the Movie,” a film critical of Clinton, which they wanted to air before the 2008 election. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which was designed to “get money out of politics,” prohibited such a film from being aired near election day. The Federal Election Commission ruled the film an illegal “electioneering communication” and banned Citizens United from distributing it.
Love it or hate it, that film was free speech, and the Federal Election Commission action was censorship. The Supreme Court upheld the letter and the spirit of the First Amendment when it struck down that decision and protected unpopular speech from government censorship. When politicians say they want to get money out of politics, what they really want is to get government censors into it.
The reason they haven’t changed their tune is that the call for “getting money out of politics” was never about money; it was always about ideas. Trump showed in 2016 that even without money, ideas that are dangerous to the establishment can take off. Bloomberg and Steyer showed this year that even with money, ideas no one wants to hear will not lead to electoral victory.
Candidates on the left have long received free advertising from a media establishment that thinks the same way they do. But the 2016 and 2020 election cycles broke that connection as the people started getting the word directly from the candidates and their outside supporters.
Yet the drumbeat for censorship goes on as the politicians whose ideas find favor with the mainstream media want to make sure theirs are the only ideas you ever get to hear. Today it will be about money, but only because money is the means to spread ideas. The attacks on the First Amendment will not stop with overturning Citizens United. If they are allowed to weaken the First Amendment, all “electioneering communications” will be restricted, and the free flow of ideas that disrupted the big spenders will end.","['mainstream', 'media', 'censorship', 'drumbeat']"
"Merril Hoge, one of the most outspoken critics against the alarm surrounding CTE studies, also underscored that, from his lens, demonizing sports like football does more harm to American children than good.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/hype-or-horror-the-risk-of-cte-brain-disease-divides-football-and-medical-communities?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20foxnews%2Fhealth%20%28Internal%20-%20Health%20-%20Text%29,fox-news,sport,right,29.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Football. Drugs. Aggression. Murder. Jail. Suicide.
How much of ex-NFL player Aaron Hernandez’s troubled life stemmed from the brain injury chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known simply as CTE?
The question has been re-ignited on the heels of the hit Netflix documentary “Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,” with medical experts, players, parents and sporting bodies purporting to understand the still mysterious – and highly controversial – condition.
How much of a cause for concern is it really?
“CTE is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that shares characteristics with Alzheimer’s disease. The major differences between those two diseases is how they begin, the location of the initial brain lesions, and pattern of progression, and the clinical symptoms that result,” Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told Fox News. “CTE is very rare in the overall population, but it is clearly prevalent in populations with significant exposure to brain trauma.”
While often associated with football, CTE was first recognized in the 1920s as “punch drunk syndrome” in boxers. Since then, it has expanded to raise red flags around a myriad of other sports including soccer, rugby, horse racing, bull-riding, skiing/snowboarding, hockey, and wrestling.
Medical researchers now believe CTE is caused by an accumulation of apparent tau proteins in the brain – which can impair neuro-pathways.
“Cells start to die and the brain starts to shrink, causing memory problems and trouble living your daily life, and problems with behavior, specifically outbursts of violence,” explained Michael L. Alosco, Assistant Professor of Neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine, which has pioneered much of the CTE research over the past 12 years. “But we are trying to get a better sense of what this disease looks like in life.”
Yet it is a condition where there are seemingly more unknowns than there are knowns.
As it stands, there is no accurate mechanism for detecting abnormal tau abrasions in a living person. It’s only after death, in an autopsy, that such an abnormality can be identified. Moreover, scientists are still in the process of determining what specific genetic markers make one person must prone to CTE than another person, irrespective of the number of knocks and head traumas. And many of the indicia can be attributed to other neurological diseases.
FAMILY MURDER SUICIDES IN YEMEN HIGHLIGHT DEPTHS OF WAR-INDUCED MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS
The biggest advancement, Alosco highlighted, that they are working toward is a “tau tracer” that could be effective on a live patient.
“CTE has only recently been recognized. Whenever a new disorder or pathology is identified or suggested, there is much research to understand the causative or contributing factors, pathological processes, clinical diagnosis, lab tests, and imaging,” observed Dr. Joseph Horrigan of the Southern California University of Health Sciences. “(But) the symptoms of those who develop what we label as CTE should be alarming. We are seeing athletes with outstanding physical and mental capabilities become reduced to patients with cognitive deficits, memory loss, irritability and aggression, impulse control issues, mood changes and in some cases suicide. These symptoms are occurring at a younger age than we would normally expect.”
Alosco said that Hernandez, who was 27 when he died behind bars almost three years ago, had a “pretty advanced disease,” but the youngest case he can recall was that of a 24-year-old. Boston University currently has one of the largest brain banks in the world, its researchers have analyzed more than 650 brains of a wide age range in the endeavor to establish a CTE consensus.
And there has been no shortage of lawsuits surrounding the alleged prevalence of CTE. In 2011, almost 5000 retired players collectively sued the NFL claiming long-term neurocognitive diseases that could be connected to CTE, ending in a $1 billion agreement for a longstanding compensation fund to aid former players and their families.
In 2018, 53 former professional wrestlers accused World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) of masking the threat of head injuries. The suit was subsequently dismissed and is not on appeal. That same year, more than 300 players joined the multidistrict litigation against the National Hockey League (NHL) regarding neurological woes. And in August last year, an Illinois federal judge approved a $75 million settlement between the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and millions of student-athletes to monitor concussion symptoms.
The likes of Paul Wood, 38, a former professional rugby league player in the U.K. is already prepared for his symptoms to start worsening.
“I sustained substantial head impacts most games and during training on a regular basis which today I feel certainly contributes to my memory loss, mood swings and lack of concentration,” he noted, underscoring that such symptoms have become more pronounced since retiring in 2018. “I had numerous concussions but the nature of our environment meant I always wanted to keep training or playing, even with headaches.”
Wood underscored that the subject of CTE is especially worrisome given that “rugby league is a high-impact sport,” and that he didn’t wear protection. However, experts say that headgear makes little difference when it comes to this particular purported disease.
“I don’t think (headgear) is going to make all that much difference when it comes to CTE,” said Alosco. “Headgear is meant to stop skull fractures, not stop the brain from moving.”
From Nowinski’s lens, “our society needs to have a serious discussion about preventing and learning how to treat CTE.”
“Three million children currently play tackle football, and our research has shown that their odds of developing CTE increase by 30 percent each year they play,” he continued. “Those individuals began playing football as children, most of the exposure happened before the age of 18, meaning before the age of consent. We need to change how we play sports.”
Such changes, he pointed out, entail “in football, reducing contact in practice, in soccer limiting exposure to headers,” and in baseball introducing limits as to “how many times you can hit an athlete in the head.”
But certainly, not everyone will develop protracted neurological issues either during their playing days or in the decades that come after. The lack of definitive answers – as of yet – has turned CTE into an especially decisive issue across the country.
New Jersey native Anthony Patanella, 38, said he has suffered more concussions in his two-decade career as a professional boxer than he can count – and said more needs to be done from the top to minimize CTE risks.
“They can stop fights sooner if the fighter is taking too many punches and not punching back or moving his head to avoid taking hits,” he said. “I’ve seen other fights with (evident) brain damage, slurring their words, and it is sad. (Too many blows) can affect you in the long haul, and then it is too late.”
Yet Merril Hoge, a former running back for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bears later turned ESPN analyst, has been one of the most outspoken critics against the alarm surrounding CTE studies – putting much of the research down to “science fiction” and “misleading” science far from a factual realm. In 2018, he co-authored the controversial book “Brainwashed: The Bad Science Behind CTE and the Plot to Destroy Football” with Dr. Peters Cummings, an assistant neurobiology professor at BU, essentially rejected much of the “unfounded” hype.
“It is easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled. Concussion and TBI (traumatic brain injury) are real, but there is no connection between this and CTE,” Hoge lamented, stressing that “CTE” has too often become something of an excuse for poor behavioral patterns in later life.
He also underscored that, from his lens, demonizing sports like football does more harm to American children than good.
“The leading cause of brain disease is obesity. We have kids rotting in front of our eyes from sugar and inactivity, and now we want to create a corrupt narrative for them not to play,” Hoge conjectured. “With all the head trauma protocol and treatments we have available today, we have the best environment for our kids to be playing in the history of sports.”
XFL RULES TO IMPACT COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAM'S SPRING GAME
For its part, the NFL has continued to back government-funded research on the issue as part of its “Play Smart. Play Safe” initiative and has allocated $40 million toward medical research primarily devoted to neuroscience.
“Important research advancements have been made over the last several years around traumatic brain injury (TBIs). Close attention needs to be paid to these research findings and collectively the research community must work together,” Dr. Sills, the Chief Medical Officer of the NFL, told Fox News. “While we don’t have all the answers, the NFL has been a leader on player health and safety including implementing data-driven rules changes that aim to help eliminate potentially risky behavior that could lead to injuries, especially to the head and neck; and instituting a concussion protocol reflecting the most up-to-date medical consensus on the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions.”
Sills stressed that the NFL is furthermore providing sideline medical support that includes unaffiliated medical personnel and new technology to assist in the identification and review of injuries, with a specific focus on concussions; mandating ongoing health and safety education for players and training for club and non-affiliated medical personnel; developing mandatory guidelines on protective equipment; enforcing limits on contact practice; and advancing developments in engineering, biomechanics, advanced sensors, and materials science that mitigate forces and better protect against injuries in contact sports and recreational sports.
So where to go from here?
Anthony Trucks, a former player for the Washington Redskins and Pittsburgh Steelers who retiring just over a decade ago said that while he does have some concerns, he thinks the alarm has largely been “blown out of proportion.”
“If you were ever going to play, now is the safest time,” he said. “And there are many benefits to the game. I want my kids to go to practice, and competition is great for humanity.”

Indeed, for many professionals, the benefits of the game far outweigh the cons.

The fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/27/stop-blaming-pro-lifers-for-the-lefts-racism/?utm_source=The+Federalist+List&utm_campaign=22f3c24165-RSS_The_Federalist_Daily_Updates_w_Transom&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cfcb868ceb-22f3c24165-83771301,federalist,abortion,right,29.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Thanks to abortion, America is whiter than it would be if all those babies were allowed to live. If pro-lifers had their way, the United States would be blacker and browner than it is today.
Another day, another pro-lifer smeared as a racist. In August, it was Catholic author J.D. Vance, whom a Washington Post writer tried to tar with the r-word, only to fall flat when it was revealed that she misrepresented what Vance said and failed to note that his wife and son are Indian American. This time around, it is Episcopalian Tucker Carlson, accused by Farhad Manjoo in Sunday’s New York Times of “advancing ethnonationalist populism” and worse.
Like some falsehoods, this latest has a kernel of truth: The Fox News host is a “populist.” But the magical-thinking leap from populism to racism, which is now de rigueur in such hit pieces, crashes and burns. Manjoo’s charge is drawn mostly from a staffer at uber-woke Media Matters, whose job, apparently, is to watch Fox News and follow social media. White nationalists, reports Manjoo ominously, quoting the Media Matters researcher, “look at [Tucker] as a thought leader and an influential thinker.”
So? Whatever else you make of him, that’s what Carlson is. Anyone within reach of a television could say the same, from Antifa members to fans of “Stranger Things.” If we’re really going to talk about racism, let’s ask a more interesting question than any in the New York Times piece: Who, exactly, thinks that adding more brown and black people to the world is a good thing — and who doesn’t?
‘Family Planning’ Means Reducing Minorities
Whether it means to or not, team left amounts to keeping the world a whiter place. Recall Bernie Sanders’ recent open fretting about “overpopulation” and the need for more birth control in the “poor countries.” On any short list of those nations — say, the poorest 20 — almost all lie in Africa. To well-off, aging, lefty Westerners, more young Africans amounts to a problem.
On the global, liberal left, that same preoccupation with Africans and their fertility is endemic. In July 2017, childless French President Emmanuel Macron worried at an appearance in Germany over the “civilizational” challenges facing Africa, singling out the fact that women in some countries still have “seven or eight children.” Elsewhere that same summer, Canada’s minister of international development, Marie-Claude Bibeau, called abortion “a tool to end poverty.” En route to a “family planning” meeting in Rwanda, she was not speaking of Canadians.
The forward-looking Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is another powerful institution, the resources of which, whatever the intentions behind them, will have the effect of bringing fewer African babies into the world. Which, exactly, are the families that apparently need to be “planned” — a euphemism for “reduced,” since “family planning” never includes family expansion? Check the faces on the relevant section of the website. They do not resemble Icelanders or Finns.
It isn’t only the prospect of more Africans that summons anxiety in some places. In 2009, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a slip akin to Macron’s, when she said in an interview with New York Times Magazine that “at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” She didn’t mean descendants of those who sailed on the Mayflower.
Pro-Lifers Would Bless the World with Brown Babies
So returning to our original question: Who, exactly, doesn’t think bringing more brown and black humans into the world is a problem?
One contender is the Catholic Church. Pope Francis just concluded a tour of several countries on the continent, tacitly affirming what everyone who can count already knows: The future of Christianity lies in Africa. It’s in tradition-minded Africa that Christianity has grown explosively during these last decades. African priests and ministers are now routinely being exported to the United States, to re-evangelize the descendants of the people who first evangelized them.
The pro-life movement isn’t for keeping down the numbers of brown and black people, either. In such circles — and only in such circles — the fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned. The pro-life Lozier Institute, among others, keeps steady track of disparities such as these: “In 2016, as in previous years, more African American babies were aborted than were born alive in New York City.” Outside the pro-life movement, this racial disparity garners not a peep, including from people who accuse others of promoting “whiteness.”
Say what you like about pro-lifers, including Carlson, but they don’t think whitening up the country is a good thing. That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know. It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness.
Here’s an irony: Thanks to Roe, America is a whiter place than it would otherwise have become. If pro-lifers had had their way, on the other hand, America would be considerably blacker and browner than it is today. So do the thought experiment: Which result might a real supremacist like more?","['chronicled', 'mourned']"
Many of the U.S. Border Patrol agents on the front lines of the U.S. effort to secure the southern border with Mexico bristle at what they see as public misconceptions and media mischaracterization of their work.,https://www.foxnews.com/media/hispanic-border-patrol-media-coverage-lara-logan,fox-news,immigration,right,29.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Many of the U.S. Border Patrol agents on the front lines of the U.S. effort to secure the southern border with Mexico bristle at what they see as public misconceptions and media mischaracterization of their work.
In Fox Nation's new series ""Lara Logan Has No Agenda,"" veteran correspondent Lara Logan traveled to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where she interviewed a horse patrol unit of the U.S. Border Patrol. These men were all born and raised in the area and most of them are Hispanics.
""At the end of a long day, with the light fading fast, they rested their horses and waited into the night for the next call,"" narrated Logan. ""It seemed like a good moment for a conversation, a glimpse of the view from their side.
""What's one of the things that just drives you crazy that people believe about what's going on down here that's just not true?"" she asked.
Jose Calderon, a U.S. Border Patrol agent, replied: ""I think a lot of it is how they portray us as like villains. How bad of a job we do or that we're mean to people. That's not the case. We all have families.""
Logan pressed: ""So why do it then? What does it mean to you? What do you see as your mission?""
Calderon said: ""Pretty much we're here to protect our borders, protect our country, that's what we stand for, I think. That's what I stand for.""
Earlier in the episode, Logan was joined by Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, as she got a rare look inside an immigration processing center in McAllen, Texas, which is the largest in the country.
In July 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made explosive allegations about the conditions there.
At the time, illegal border crossings were surging and overwhelming facilities built to temporarily detain people. According to federal government data released in 2019, Border Patrol agents apprehended more migrants at the border in fiscal year 2019 than in any year since fiscal 2007.
'UNBEARABLE' INTERVIEW OF WOMEN FORCED INTO SEX TRADE: LARA LOGAN
""At first, Democrats accused President Trump of manufacturing a crisis at the border,"" reported Logan. ""Then with Border Patrol overwhelmed, checkpoints shut down and the number of people crossing at record levels, Democrats switched from manufactured crisis to humanitarian, and turned their sights on processing centers that were overflowing.""
Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after her July tour: ""In that last facility, I was not safe from the officers in that facility.""
The congresswoman said she found it to be a ""violent culture."" In a video released on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez accused the U.S. government of running ""concentration camps"" on the border.
""We were arresting 12,000 people per week here,"" said Rodolfo Karisch, who is Chief Patrol Agent in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. ""At one point time, I had 9,000 people in custody at all of our facilities, including the one that you're in.""
LOGAN CONFRONTS ALLEGED CARTEL DOCTOR, ACCUSED OF TORTURING DEA AGENT
Deputy Patrol Agent in Charge Oscar Escamilla told Logan: ""I have gang members coming in here. As a matter of fact, I have two subjects who committed murder in the last 24 hours that we apprehended -- in this place. One of them committed double murders in the U.S. that we have in our custody.""
Karisch said: ""There is endless possibilities of what could happen. But it always comes back to this. People need to understand exactly what our job is. Our job is to protect this country, our communities. We're part of these communities. We care about what happens here.""
In fact, one of the Border Patrol's biggest concerns in determining which children in their facilities are being smuggled or trafficked by the Mexican cartels.
""An agent said to me once, 'When I'm sitting in this center and I've got a father and a child in front of me... I'm looking at that child knowing that if this isn't his father, I'm his last hope'"" said Logan.
""That's correct,"" agreed Escamilla. ""This child could be exploited further.""
Back in the field with the horse patrol agent, Logan asked them how they felt about the way the media represents them.
""I think the inaccuracy comes from the incompleteness,"" said agent Jorge Deleon. ""They only put out portions and sections of what we do. And there's never been a full [telling] to where it's a full understanding and educational for people to understand what it is that we do.""
EXCLUSIVE: LARA LOGAN CORNERED BY MEXICAN POLICE, THREATENED
Calderon added: ""You speak to these [migrants] and they'll tell you the more dangerous part of the journey is crossing Mexico. And then, they end up in the best hands. I mean, we provide them with food. We clothe them, even give them medical attention. We bathe them. I mean, we give them everything, basically, what they need.
""And then the media comes"" he continued. ""They say they're putting them in cages when that's not the case.""
Logan said: ""I almost feel like you have to apologize for upholding the law and protecting the border.""
Calderon agreed.
""They make it feel like it's wrong -- to actually do what your job is -- what you're supposed to be doing,"" said Calderon.
This episode is one installment of the four-part docuseries ""Lara Logan Has No Agenda,"" which is focused on immigration, socialism, media bias and veterans. ""Lara Logan Has No Agenda"" is available exclusively on Fox Nation.

"On one hand, naive teenagers who signed off their financial futures to leftist, anti-American institutions would catch a break. The college cartel screwed you; now here’s a government waiver to make you forever grateful to the Democrats. ",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/03/10/obama-considers-allowing-student-loans-to-be-wiped-out-in-bankruptcy/,breitbart,student-debt,right,29.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"President Obama has ordered the Department of Education and its network of federal agencies to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.
The White House unveiled a “Student Aid Bill of Rights” on Tuesday, declaring every 18-year-old in America—regardless of ability or interest—must be granted access to a college education, must borrow money from the government to finance that education on a payback plan set by the government, and must be “treated fairly” by government debt collectors. Obama instructed federal agencies to “[clarify] the rights of Federal student loan borrowers in bankruptcy” and consider “possible changes to the treatment of loans in bankruptcy proceedings and when they were borrowed under fraudulent circumstances.”
With forty million Americans holding outstanding student loans worth $1.3 trillion, the White House’s proposal is fraught with difficulties.
On one hand, naive teenagers who signed off their financial futures to leftist, anti-American institutions would catch a break. The college cartel screwed you; now here’s a government waiver to make you forever grateful to the Democrats. The ferocity with which federal agencies pursue cancer patients and even Americans who already paid off their balance is disturbing.
On the other hand, the mad push to make college “affordable” has led to a relaxation of lending standards that makes the lead-up to the 2008 housing bubble look responsible. Minimal credit checks, no estimate of future earnings, no estimation of the job market four years down the road, and sometimes no co-signer—none of these impede many Americans from getting a loan.
The damages bankruptcy inflicts on debtors looks appealing to the twenty percent who say they’ll be in debt until they die. Obama’s proposed change could start a run that would greatly increase costs to the federal government and, by extension, taxpayers.
Currently, in order to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, a debtor must prove in court they will never be able to afford their monthly payments. That’s difficult to prove even for borrowers like pancreatic cancer victim Stacy Jorgensen, who was told by collectors from the Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) that the “mere possibility of recurrence is not enough” to allow her to discharge her debt as she underwent chemotherapy. (The survival rate for pancreatic cancer hovers between 19 and five percent.)
Democrats effectively nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 by transferring eight million loans into the federal government’s hands. Republicans claim that higher interest rates students pay on their debts will fund Obamacare to the tune of $8.7 billion, while the mainstream media charges that’s a lie.
Rather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government. Earlier this year, Obama raised the maximum amount students could borrow in Pell Grants another $1,000. His administration also streamlined the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), making it easier to borrow money from the government—which is also over $18 trillion in debt, a 70 percent increase since Obama took office in 2009. In June 2011, Obama issued an executive order that allowed five million debtors to cap their monthly payments to the government at 10 percent of their income—and see their loans forgiven in 20 years.
Obama’s memorandum may encourage more Americans to take on student loan debt instead of deflating the higher education bubble.

"Father Horan was one of the many voices from the Catholic Left who joined the mainstream media lynching of students from Covington Catholic High School this weekend, rashly judging them as racists without bothering to ascertain what actually happened, simply because some of the boys were wearing MAGA hats.",https://www.breitbart.com/faith/2019/01/21/catholic-priest-slams-march-for-life-as-repulsive-and-futile/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,abortion,right,29.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A prominent American priest has dissed the Washington March for Life as “repulsive and futile,” denouncing the pro-life event as “basically a gathering for many right-wing anti-abortion hardliners.”
Franciscan friar Father Daniel Horan, a pro-LGBT priest and professor who will be speaking at the upcoming Los Angeles Religious Education Congress, took to Twitter this weekend to bash the March for Life and condemn without trial a group of white Catholic high school boys as “racists” for supposedly “taunting” a Native American man beating a drum.
Father Horan was one of the many voices from the Catholic Left who joined the mainstream media lynching of students from Covington Catholic High School this weekend, rashly judging them as racists without bothering to ascertain what actually happened, simply because some of the boys were wearing MAGA hats.
While the Jesuit-run America magazine claimed that a small group of Native American demonstrators had been “surrounded by a much larger band of teenagers” and that the boys had “heckled” and “mocked” elder Nathan Phillips, video footage told a different story.
Videos show the Native Americans approaching and confronting the youths, and Mr. Phillips himself begins playing his drum just inches from the face of one of the boys, who simply smiles at him. One of the boys later wrote that they had been confused by the behavior of the Native Americans and realized only later that they had been set up for a “publicity stunt.”
The perfect storm of white Catholic males wearing Make America Great Again hats and attending the March for Life to protest abortion was just too tempting for the mainstream media to pass up, even if the narrative was completely false.
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, whoever “even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient foundation, the moral fault of a neighbor” is guilty of rash judgment, and whoever, “by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the reputation of others and gives occasion for false judgments concerning them” is guilty of calumny.
Like many others on the left, Father Horan seemed convinced that the school boys must be racists because they were white and wore MAGA hats, and so the facts of the encounter were basically irrelevant.
The March for Life is just “a GOP rally,” he tweeted, which “includes parade of GOP political-speakers and racist high-school students in MAGA hats taunting Native Americans.”
Just one of many reasons I find the so-called “march for life” often repulsive and futile: It’s basically a gathering for many right-wing anti-abortion hardliners (not consistent ethic of life, i.e. true pro-lifers) and teens to get a free trip to goof off (at best) in DC. 2/2 — Daniel P. Horan, OFM (@DanHoranOFM) January 19, 2019
While vehemently anti-March for Life, Father Horan has praised the pro-abortion Women’s March as consistent with Catholic social teaching. The fact that pro-life women and organizations are not welcomed at the event seems not to bother his conscience in the slightest.
According to the website of the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, where Father Horan teaches, he is a “systematic theologian who researches and teaches in the areas of constructive theology, spirituality, and the medieval Franciscan philosophical and theological tradition.”
He is also co-editor of New Theology Review.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warren's radical immigration plans involves decriminalizing illegal immigration, increasing legal immigration, and ending all detention of illegal aliens, minus those deemed to be “a flight or safety risk.”",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/07/11/warren-immigration-plan-decriminalize-illegal-immigration-end-detention-of-border-crossers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,immigration,right,30.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) released one of the most radical immigration plans of any 2020 candidate to date Thursday.
It involves decriminalizing illegal immigration, increasing legal immigration, and ending all detention of illegal aliens, minus those deemed to be “a flight or safety risk.”
Warren’s team detailed the far-left plan in a Medium post, using false narratives on the Trump administration’s immigration policies as a backdrop for what essentially amounts to an “open borders” immigration proposal.
Here’s what she plans to do:
Decriminalize illegal border crossings:
Warren took aim at Section 1325 of the immigration code, which makes it a criminal offense for people to cross the border illegally. She believes it is “totally unnecessary for border security,” essentially dismissing the criminals – including drug-traffickers and human-traffickers – who take advantage of the porous border.
As Breitbart News reported:
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data provided to the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week reveal that two recent caravans of about 11,300 nationals that flooded the United States-Mexico border in October 2018 and January 2019 included about 1,520 previously deported illegal aliens who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S. Of those 1,520 previously deported illegal aliens with U.S. criminal convictions:
Those convictions included murder, sex crimes, violence against law enforcement, assault, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
Despite that, Warren pledged to “immediately issue guidance to end criminal prosecutions for simple administrative immigration violations; end Operation Streamline, which subjects migrants to mass prosecutions; and refocus our limited resources on actual criminals and real threats to the United States.”
“I will also issue prosecutorial guidance to prioritize immigration cases with security concerns, and make sure government attorneys are properly exercising their discretion for individuals who pose no public safety risk,” she added.
However, she did not release criteria on what constitutes a legitimate “public safety risk.”
Divide the relationship between law enforcement and immigration enforcement agencies:
Warren wants to divide the working relationship between law enforcement and immigration enforcement agencies, arguing that law enforcement should not handle immigration violations because it makes people “less willing to report crimes for fear of revealing their immigration status.”
“Combining these functions sows distrust and harms public safety,” she wrote.
She promised to put “strict guidelines” in place to establish additional safe spaces:
I’ll expand programs that grant protections to immigrant victims of serious crimes who come forward and assist law enforcement. And I’ll end programs like 287(g) and ‘Secure Communities’ that force local cops to enforce federal immigration laws so they can focus on effectively serving their communities.
Remake U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):
Warren accused the existing agencies of implementing “anti-immigrant policies that target communities of color” and promised to reshape them “top to bottom, focusing their efforts on homeland security efforts like screening cargo, identifying counterfeit goods, and preventing smuggling and trafficking.”
Significantly reduce immigration detention for illegal alien border crossers:
Warren essentially wants to end immigration detention, citing the Obama-era images of “kids in cages” and family separation, which President Trump effectively ended after signing an executive order in June. She wants to eradicate ICE’s contracts with private detention centers and promised to use detention centers only when she deems it “actually necessary.” She only cited two reasons: If the individual “poses a flight or safety risk. ”
She also floated “alternatives” to detention like check-ins and surveillance. However, alternatives – like ankle monitors – have been found to be largely ineffective.
Warren says she will “significantly reduce immigration detention"" and instead invest in ""alternatives to detention"", such as ankle monitors. In fact, the evidence in favor of ATDs is quite weak. In many cases, aliens simply cut off the ankle bracelets.https://t.co/NZDYMJFiFs — Center for Immigration Studies (@CIS_org) July 11, 2019
Drastically increase the refugee cap:
The Massachusetts senator’s plan involves increasing the refugee cap eight times greater than current levels, with an ultimate goal of 175,000 refugees per year by the end of her first term.
Elizabeth Warren wants to drastically raise the refugee cap to 125,000 in her first year and eventually reach 175,000, in order to save lives. Of all UNHCR resettlement submissions, only 7.5% are urgent. Resettlement is rarely a matter of life and death.https://t.co/Jlzu5WXZHH — Center for Immigration Studies (@CIS_org) July 11, 2019
Eliminate expedited removal:
Warren’s plan calls for the total elimination of “expedited removal proceedings.”
“I’ll eliminate the use of expedited removal proceedings and guarantee hearings,” Warren wrote. “I’ll call for creating a national-scale immigration public defender corps, and a Warren administration will provide access to counsel in immigration court.
Provide additional protections for “special” groups:
Warren promised to provide special protections for “LGBTQ+ individuals who are, she claims, “more vulnerable in a general detention facility”:
I will put additional layers of protection in place for certain groups, including asylum seekers, families and pregnant women, and LGBTQ+ people who are more vulnerable in a general detention facility. And I’ll enforce strict standards for remaining detention facilities, including for medical care and to end the use of solitary confinement.
Massively increase legal immigration levels:
Not only does Warren’s plan promise to decriminalize the actions of illegal immigrants, it also promises to increase legal immigration levels – something critics say does not match her supposed devotion to blue collar workers. She issued a preemptive explanation, writing, “We should put American workers first by ensuring that workers already here get the first opportunity to fill any available positions.”
However, drastic population booms sorely affect the working class, driving up housing costs – something that hurts blue-collar families struggling to keep their heads above water.
The overarching theme of Warren’s plan is “open borders.” It essentially makes every state a “sanctuary” by greatly decriminalizing illegal immigration and stripping agencies of enforcement powers. How this benefits the American workers Warren claims to champion remains unseen.
Overall, Warren's new immigration plan represents a dismantling of immigration enforcement, a massive handout to cartels and coyotes smuggling migrants through Latin America, and a drastic expansion of total immigration into the United States at the expense of US workers. — Center for Immigration Studies (@CIS_org) July 11, 2019",['radical']

The study, published in the scientific journal, Geophysical Research Letters, looked at 15 years worth of data from the government agency's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument over tropical oceans and noticed that extreme storms tend to occur more frequently over warmer sea temperatures. For every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit rise in ocean temperatures, 21 percent more storms form, the researchers found.
""It is somewhat common sense that severe storms will increase in a warmer environment. Thunderstorms typically occur in the warmest season of the year,"" NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) researcher Hartmut Aumann, explained in a statement. ""But our data provide the first quantitative estimate of how much they are likely to increase, at least for the tropical oceans.""
CLIMATE CHANGE IS CAUSING WAVES TO GET BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL, STUDY SHOWS
Extreme storms are defined as those that produce at least 3 millimeters of rain per hour over a 16-mile area.
By the end of the century, ocean surface temperatures may rise as much as 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit, assuming a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to current climate models.
Though the study notes climate models are not perfect, they do help to provide a guideline for those looking to prepare for the changes, such as lawmakers and citizens.
""Our results quantify and give a more visual meaning to the consequences of the predicted warming of the oceans,"" Aumann added. ""More storms mean more flooding, more structure damage, more crop damage and so on unless mitigating measures are implemented.""
ANTARCTIC ICE IS MELTING SIX TIMES FASTER THAN IT DID IN THE 1980s AND COULD 'DESTABILIZE' GLACIERS
In 2014, the World Health Organization estimated climate change could cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, thanks to a rise in issues such as malnutrition, heat stress and malaria. However, a new study published earlier this month called that a ""conservative estimate.""

“Do we really think that this is as good as we can be as a nation? I don’t think the vast majority of people think that,” Biden said in an online event titled, “The Shade Room” moderated by actor Don Cheadle. “There are probably anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the people out there that are just not very good people. But that’s not who we are. The vast majority of people are decent. We have to appeal to that and we have to unite people.”
While falling short of calling half the nation “deplorable” as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did in 2016, the comments echo a deep disdain for a large population of the country increasingly perpetuated by left-wing elites in the wake of the George Floyd protests characterizing the U.S. as irredeemably racist. Part of that campaign includes now branding every facet of American life around oppressing black people, from declaring the Second Amendment racist to the threat from the novel Wuhan coronavirus.
“The history of our country is not a fairy tale, it doesn’t guarantee a happy ending, but as I said earlier, we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation,” Biden said at the event that also featured Atlanta businessman Ryan Wilson. “It’s been a constant push and pull for the last 200 years.”
Biden’s comments also reflect the anti-American teachings of the New York Times’ “1619 Project” that the legacy paper is pushing on school curriculums attempting to re-write U.S. history as entirely evil and corrupt.

Harris is also pushing legislation that would dramatically expand the legal and financial incentives for hundreds of thousands of Indian low-wage college graduates to take U.S.-based jobs from U.S. college graduates.,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2019/04/03/kamala-harris-congress-should-hire-daca-illegal/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,immigration,right,31.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"DACA illegal immigrants should be hired to help prepare laws for 330 million Americans, according to a draft bill introduced by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and 20 other Democratic senators.
“The giant sign outside my office says ‘DREAMers Welcome Here’ because we know and value the contributions that these young people have made to their communities,” the California senator said in a Wednesday statement about the DACA job offer. She continued:
But right now, those same young people are banned from giving back to their country by working for Congress. That has to change … Government works best when it reflects the people it represents. Our nation’s DREAMers are some of our best and brightest, and it’s time they had the opportunity to get a job or paid internship on Capitol Hill.
“The American Dream Employment Act would expand Congress’ talent pool, give Dreamers a seat at the table, and strengthen policymaking for all Americans,” said Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.
“I’ve been proud to have several Dreamers work in my office as volunteer interns and have seen firsthand how the people of Illinois would benefit if Dreamers could serve as paid employees in my office,” said Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin.
The jobs and status giveaway to DACA illegal immigrants is linked to Harris’s high-profile run for the presidency.
“Kamala Harris is going all in on immigration reform,” said a pro-Harris article in Politico, which also highlighted the claim by open-borders advocates that federal immigration law is “a mean-spirited ban on Dreamers.” The article continued:
It’s the latest move by the California Democrat to seize on an issue that her rival Beto O’Rourke has made his calling card — and to advocate for a Democratic constituency that’s often reduced to a congressional bargaining chip.
Harris is also pushing legislation that would dramatically expand the legal and financial incentives for hundreds of thousands of Indian low-wage college graduates to take U.S.-based jobs from U.S. college graduates. Harris’s mother is from India.
Weird but true: GOP and Dems in Congress are offering fast-track green cards to encourage 300,000+ vr. low wage Indian workers to take jobs from middle class American voters & graduates. FWIW I don't think the pols & staffers recognize what they are doing https://t.co/4TIUFzhC9b — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 1, 2019
The DACA population was created in 2012 when former President Barack Obama told his deputies to stop enforcing immigration laws against younger illegal aliens. Obama also directed them to hand out work permits to the illegal aliens despite the huge job loses caused by the 2008 crash to blue-collar Americans, and especially on Africa Americans youths.
Roughly 800,000 “DACA” illegal immigrants got the work permits — despite a law saying only Congress can provide work permits.
The resulting increase in the labor supply cut wages for blue-collar Americans and created an incentive for many additional Central Americans to migrate into blue-collar workplaces, neighborhoods, and K-12 schools around the United States. Very few DACA illegal aliens hold white-collar jobs, such as professor, lawyer, journalist, or video editor — although a growing number of white-collar jobs are being lost to Indian visa workers.
The new Harris bill, titled American Dream Employment Act, was also introduced in the House by Arizona Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, and it is backed by more than 50 Democrats.
The Harris legislation spotlights the efforts by Democrats to smuggle illegal immigrants into the center of American society despite popular support for immigration laws. Already, several states allow illegal immigrants to take licensed jobs, such as lawyers, in New York.
The move also showcases the Democrats’ view that the United States is a “Nation of Immigrants” — and not a nation created by and for Americans.
The immigrant-first view is increasingly held by college-trained white progressives who play a critical role in the Democratic primaries. For example, survey data shows that roughly 90 percent of white progressives with post-graduate credentials believe any curbs on the immigration of people who are not of European ancestry count as “racism”:
The word racist doesn't really describe much because people's conceptions of the word varies a lot and it often devolves into labeling and demonization. The chart below however is very interesting pic.twitter.com/Q6jFHd6W1p — Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) April 3, 2019
In turn, the white progressives’ pro-migration views are part of a larger shift towards a claim by progressives that they should be given government power to ameliorate racial disparities nationwide, such as racial disparities in wealth, income, and education. The race-based demand for power is not strongly supported by Latino and black American voters and is strongly opposed by the non-college white voters who would lose out in a pro-minority, progressive-run government.
NYT op-ed: Progressives (not conservatives) fuel national disputes over race/ethnic differences. But progressives also want more immigration to create more diversity & differences. IOW, political pyromaniacs demand firefighter job plus a gasoline allowance https://t.co/6DyaSrcwEk — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 25, 2019
The progressives’ demand for power to remedy racial differences comes as Asian immigrants, including Indians, are outpacing the income of white Americans.
The shift by progressives towards racial politics is called the “Great Awokening” by Vox.com:
In the past five years, white liberals have moved so far to the left on questions of race and racism that they are now, on these issues, to the left of even the typical black voter. … Pollsters began to see a rapid, sustained change [in 2014]. White Democrats suddenly started expressing dramatically higher levels of concern about racial inequality and discrimination, while showing greater enthusiasm for racial diversity and immigration. … And, critically, white liberals are much more enthusiastic about the idea that diversity makes the United States a better place to live than are blacks or Latinos. Non-liberal whites are least enthusiastic of all, which is not enormously surprising, but Latino views of this are closer to those of non-liberal whites than to white liberals.
The Harris bill is backed by business groups that want more immigrants to cut wages and to spike revenues. For example, the legislation is backed by FWD.us, a lobbying group created by wealthy West Coast investors, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg.
There should be no penalty for illegal immigration, says Julian Castro, one of the Democrats' presidential candidates. He also wants amnesty for millions. OK, so offering wage cuts and rent hikes may not be the best campaign tactic, but it is original. https://t.co/ZQJ25AHWkM — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) April 2, 2019
Each year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university.
But the federal government then imports approximately 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.
This federal policy of flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor is intended to boost economic growth for investors. This policy shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts children’s schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.","['dramatically', 'take', 'pushing']"

Do we have the will to unite once more?
Are we at war? Did we pass that invisible line beyond which the country cannot hold? After everything the Democrats and the media have put us through since the election of Donald Trump, is it even possible to imagine peaceful reconciliation and common national purpose?
For a majority of Americans, the answers to those three questions are as obvious as they are dispiriting. That so many believe the country has fallen, is falling, or will be falling soon is a terrifying reality. An America that destroys itself will be like nothing the world has seen. If our institutions fall, if indiscriminate violence becomes the norm, if the economy crashes, we will condemn ourselves to not years, but decades of poverty and chaos.
For far too many on the left, chaos is the point. Destruction is the goal. They prefer the unknown madness that lies ahead to whatever is still managing to (barely) hold us together in the present.
Constitutional republicans often look at what the left unleashes and see no point in pretending that we are a nation at peace. Some would rather we finally end this lingering “cold civil war” and get down to the dirty business of fighting for America’s future.
Why doesn’t this prospect terrify every politician in the American government? Why do they work so hard to exacerbate the conflict when their offices and positions of power will be the first casualties of any actual war that tears this country apart? Are they all so blind to believe that they can lead a country to victory by destroying it?
How do we avoid a war that will end America when mayors, governors, congressmen, judges, journalists, and bureaucrats are all actively conspiring to drag us into the blaze?
On May 25, a black man died in police custody. We saw images of a police officer’s knee on the back of this man’s neck. Immediately, Americans—almost to a person—said, “This is wrong.”
There is no great divide on the moral question of what happened to George Floyd. There is no disagreement between the defenders of law and order and the defenders of civil liberty. In this case, law and order and civil liberty require the same response. All Americans should have been able to unite in condemning this injustice.
What happened instead? Radical leftists transformed a moment of national agreement into one of divisive conflict.
Americans united in their sense of what is just have no reason to destroy each other. Unity and agreement lead to peace. Uncorralled passion and grievance, however, can turn violence into a political opportunity.
The looting and riots and fires in blue cities across the country today reaffirm that it is not “justice” but “war” that today’s radicals have in mind. From a moment that brought all Americans together in their sense of right and wrong, politicians and groups bent on destabilizing the nation chose division…and got their way.
After nights of murder and loss, President Trump walked to a firebombed church with a Bible in hand. There was a moment to de-escalate. There was an opportunity to choose calm. There was a chance for reconciliation. Instead, CNN accused the president of hurting “peaceful protesters” for a photo op. Some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country call him a fascist, a bigot, and a murderer.
When every act of peace is treated like war, and every act of war is treated like justice, how do Democrats expect to preserve a future America for them to lead?
If Democrats believe that creation can only come from wanton destruction, how can we ever trust them to choose peace when they have an opportunity to destroy?
Breaking store windows, setting buildings on fire, vandalizing monuments to American heroes, leaving graffiti threats on synagogue walls, attacking Christian churches and tombstones, terrorizing the living, and giving no peace to the dead— these are the great accomplishments of Antifa and those they egg on. They have given America her own “Kristallnacht” and still fail to see the sad irony. Or maybe they understand it completely. Maybe it’s only sad to those with their eyes and ears open because the press so easily missed the joke.
Most Americans had no idea that leftists thought setting the nation on fire was akin to the Boston Tea Party. Though most Americans who’ve been paying attention never really understood how Democrats could so easily join hands with Iran’s Ayatollah, the Chinese Communist Party, dangerous drug cartels on our southern border, and international corporations that have strengthened China at the expense of the American worker. How can Democrats be friends with so many of our enemies and pretend—with a straight face—that they are still our friends as well?
If America is to survive, something new must take hold right now. The current political parties and officeholders and corporate-owned media are not up to the task.
Politicians who cheer on destruction should be behind bars, not before microphones.
Those who directly or indirectly fund mayhem and destruction should be in courtrooms defending their actions, not hiding on palatial estates while applauding the carnage.
Social media giants who act as authoritarian state censors should not be afforded extra-constitutional protections while they work to undermine the rights of everyone else.
If we will unite together once more, America may well recover. If we do not, it’s future survival could be in danger. We must stand up to the insurrectionists all around us—and we must do so today, lest it becomes that much harder to do so tomorrow.
Tolerance for criminality and political sabotage has led us to the edge of a dangerous cliff. We will either dig our heels into the ground and push back or we risk falling into the murky depths below.","['blue', 'cities', 'radicals', 'bent', 'destabilizing', 'war']"

Yet while 45 million Americans are on the hook for more than $1.4 trillion in student debt, Americans should realize that millennials don’t need a government bailout or intervention. The student debt crisis isn’t as bad as it seems, and it’s a “crisis” of our own making.
Choices Have Consequences
The average college graduate leaves school with around $31,000 in debt, which certainly sounds like a lot, but that’s just a monthly payment of approximately $300. So why are students really struggling to repay their loans?
Much of it comes down to choice. If you choose to study business, economics, engineering, computer science, or anything practical, you could see a starting salary of anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000. For people who make this much, it’s not very difficult to pay a few hundred dollars per month for student loans. With unemployment at its lowest levels in years, the labor market is tight enough that a new graduate with a useful degree shouldn’t have any trouble getting started in the workforce.
But if you major in philosophy or gender studies, you might struggle to find any job in your field, let alone a well-paying one. According to The Atlantic, “Underemployment afflicts more than 50 percent of majors in the performing arts, anthropology, art history, history, communications, political science, sociology, philosophy, psychology, and international affairs.”
Not everyone can be an engineer or a doctor, but anyone can find an area where his interests intersect with actual job prospects. Students can also double major, and gain practical experience in one field while exploring another. So if you decided a career in art history was worth the price, it shouldn’t be the government’s job to pay the bill for your student loans––even if it’s not your fault that the cost of college has exploded in recent years.
You Don’t Accidentally Rack Up Six Figures in Debt
Part of the reason the reaction to student loans has been so extreme is because horror stories once viral now seem normal, and most people know graduates with $100,000 or even more than $200,000 in debt. If bureaucrats weren’t wasting taxpayer dollars, and state governments weren’t pulling back their financial support for higher education, maybe these students wouldn’t be in that situation.
Still, there are only a few ways to acquire hundreds of thousands in debt. Maybe you went to an expensive private college for four years, or got a graduate degree. If you chose a lavish, $60,000 per-year private school like Trinity or Fordham, that’s your own fault. Average cost of attendance at a four-year public school is around $20,000 (and that’s before financial aid or scholarships, which many students receive)––so if you’re buried in hundreds of thousands in debt, it’s because you made a decision you couldn’t afford.
For graduate students, it’s understandable that they’ve taken on so much in loans, as some advanced degrees can take seven or even eight years to complete. But they don’t need the government’s help to pay back their debt. The expected lifetime earnings for someone with a doctoral degree totals $3.3 million.
I’d Rather See a Concert than Pay My Loan
Many millennials aren’t paying back their student loans. But is that because they truly can’t? In 2016, 1.1 million graduates defaulted on their loans for the first time, yet their ability to make payments might not be the problem.
When a survey asked recent graduates what they would sacrifice to pay off their debt, “less than half were willing to do without concert tickets, lattes, food delivery, alcohol purchases or travel.” Around 15 percent didn’t even know how much money they owed. Nearly a third of students polled planned to use some of their student loan money to pay for their spring break trips, while 23 percent said they had used loans to purchase alcohol, and 6 percent said they used the money for drugs. We have a student debt crisis, but the real issue isn’t the number on the balance sheet. It’s a generation trapped in perpetual adolescence, confused about how to get out.
Years ago, people in their early twenties used to have mortgages, marriages, and children to take care of. Things have changed in ways beyond my generation’s control, but it’s still embarrassing that some now think that a $300 monthly payment constitutes a crisis, and that the government needs to save them. Maybe millennials need to realize that they can’t afford to live in expensive cities, and that paying one’s debts should come before planning your next vacation.
In his recent book, “The Vanishing American Adult,” Sen. Ben Sasse wrote that “Letting the next generation believe someone else will solve their problems imperils not only them but our whole society.” Well-intentioned politicians might want to provide a solution for student loans, but millennials won’t start making smart decisions unless they have to foot the bill for their own education. Unfortunately, no bailout or special program can save students suffering from a lack of responsibility.","['slash', 'crack', 'down', 'Armageddon', 'left-wing']"

Proponents of these vaccines twist the Vatican’s words to sound like approval: The use of such vaccines...,https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/06/as-long-as-vaccines-are-tied-to-abortion-christians-need-exemptions/,federalist,vaccines,right,31.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Promoting public health through vaccines seems like the right thing to do, but there's a good reason to preserve religious exemptions: Some vaccines rely on cell lines from aborted fetal tissue.
In recent years, religious exemptions from vaccination mandates have been eliminated in some states. It began in 2015 in California, followed by Maine, New York, and Washington. Although protecting ourselves and others with vaccinations seems like the reasonable and Christian thing to do, there remains a significant reason to retain religious or conscience exemptions: Several vaccinations use cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue.
To produce vaccine antigens, viruses are propagated in host cells of other types. To maintain a ready and manageable supply of host cells, cell lines — a subculture of cells isolated from organic tissues — are maintained in laboratories. Two cell lines, named WI-38 and MRC-5, derived from the tissue of aborted fetuses, serve the manufacturing of some vaccines used in the United States.
The existence of WI-38 and MRC-5 is not new and has been defended extensively by three main arguments. First, the fetuses were not aborted for the purpose of making the vaccines. Second, these existing cell lines do not require ongoing abortions. Third, the overall benefit to public health is a worthy reason to continue manufacturing these vaccines. Let us consider these arguments in turn.
The Purpose of the Abortion
While mothers may not have had vaccines in mind when choosing abortion, abortionists and researchers had established relationships for this purpose. Researcher Leonard Hayflick sought out aborted human fetal tissue because he reasoned it would be less likely than other tissues to be contaminated by viruses. He also showed that fetal cell lines have the advantages of numerous subcultivations and susceptibility to viruses, making them ideal for mass producing vaccines.
Nineteen fetuses were used to develop cell lines WI-1 through WI-25, and after they were lost when Hayflick’s lab freezer failed, he acquired more aborted-baby tissue from a colleague in Sweden. Using this tissue, Hayflick developed more cell lines, with line WI-38 continuing to be used today for vaccine production. Strain MRC-5 was developed from an aborted baby for the purpose of vaccine development.
While parents are not seeking abortions to populate cell lines for vaccine manufacturing, researchers and abortionists recognize the benefit of fetal tissue for vaccine development, and have established relationships to facilitate the supply of this tissue to researchers. Research might be an indirect purpose of abortion, but it is still the intent of some parties involved.
Most lay people today reason, “Of course I’m not participating in the abortions. I wasn’t there. I didn’t encourage the mothers to abort. I wasn’t looking for tissue to develop a vaccine.” If one is not complicit in the abortion, what’s the harm in trying to bring some good out of it?
To make a cell line, the parts of the aborted body are minced, treated with an enzyme solution, and centrifuged into individual living cells to be cultured in a nourishing serum. These cells are subcultured and multiplied. Current cell lines WI-38 and MRC-5 are living cells, derived from the fetus, carrying the same DNA as the body from which they came.
Unlike the abortion itself, which could be distanced from our experience as a singular event in history, the ongoing use of the aborted body continues today, serving the demand for some vaccines.
No More Abortion?
Although advocates of these vaccines argue no more abortions are needed, new cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue continue to be developed. Researchers are concerned that cell reproduction in these strains will eventually become nonviable, or at least more difficult to access.
They are also motivated to discover increased duplication rates, higher limits to duplication, and improved suitability for viral propagation. Researchers have developed cell lines — including IMR-90, IMR-91, PER.C6, and Walvax-2 — from aborted fetuses, with the intent of supplementing or replacing WI-38 and MRC-5 for vaccine development.
Demand for these vaccines gives implicit abortion approval for fetal tissue research. Promoting products of abortion encourages the partnership between abortion providers and medical researchers, as well as the social acceptance of this partnership. For example, President Bill Clinton justified federal funding for fetal tissue research by the success of these vaccines. While President George W. Bush said, “We do not end some lives for the medical benefit of others,” he allowed “federal funding for research on existing stem cell lines.”
Following the 2015 criticisms against Planned Parenthood for providing fetal tissue for research, researchers responded that such experimentation is necessary, has great benefits, and should continue, pointing specifically to the precedent of vaccine development. While the Trump administration recently ended government funding for most fetal tissue research, the policy change does nothing to alter the legality of fetal tissue research. Recent efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 have again raised the question of the ethics of using fetal cell lines.
Public Health Benefit
What of the ill effects of the diseases these vaccines are given to prevent? Rubella, in particular, can be devastating to the unborn. Would we fail to love our neighbor if we had an effective vaccine yet did not use it?
Even pro-life leaders have expressed their approval of using vaccines produced with fetal cell lines, in cases with no alternative. The Vatican allowed the use of those vaccines for a “proportionate reason:” The overall defense of life expressed by vaccination against rubella was more significant than a boycott of these vaccines, especially if users expressed their objections and recognized the use was under a kind of duress.
Proponents of these vaccines twist the Vatican’s words to sound like approval: The use of such vaccines “was certainly justifiable,” does not “defy the religion’s doctrine,” raises “no theological objection,” and is “morally acceptable.” Yet a careful read of the Vatican’s essay in no way gives this impression.
The Vatican maintained that the preparation, marketing, and use of such vaccines is illicit, and their use can be allowed only because it occurs under coercion. It named the current situation “an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible.” Using the vaccines can be justified only if it does more to defend, uphold, and promote life by preventing disease than the refusal to use these vaccines.
The Vatican gave this advice in 2005, with the expectation that Christians’ objections would eventually lead to alternative vaccines. Unfortunately, the guidance did little to disrupt the widespread acceptance of vaccines using fetal cell lines. Rather, in 2009, Merck discontinued the separate measles and mumps vaccines, and offered them only as a combination with the rubella vaccine as MMR or MMRV, both of which use fetal cell lines.
Yet developing and manufacturing vaccines that do not use fetal cell lines is quite possible. Japanese manufacturers have produced both rubella and hepatitis A vaccines using nonhuman cell sources. However, they are not licensed for use in the United States.
Religious Exemptions as Part of a Unified Public Voice
Without clear, firm Christian voices objecting to these vaccines, and without demand for alternatives, it is unlikely any replacements will be developed or made available in the United States. Many Christians are simply unaware of this connection between some vaccines and abortion. We need active and regular publicity of this connection to raise awareness.
The Christian public voice should be clear and consistent. With legislative trends going against religious exemptions, strong statements from religious leaders and institutions become increasingly important. Although federal case law recognizes religious liberty to some extent, official church statements will strengthen individual claims.
Even if official statements don’t say whether we should or shouldn’t get a vaccine, they should uphold the conscience rights to object to vaccine use. Without such institutional support for conscientious decisions, individuals have difficulty arguing for religious exemption.
Christians should also ask providers for alternative vaccines, or, where alternatives do not exist, that they be developed. Such requests can be made of providers, but should especially be communicated formally to vaccine manufacturers and distributors. In some cases, Christians may choose to refuse vaccinations manufactured with cell strains developed from abortions.
In these ways, Christian laity and pastors can embrace a firm stance that the world cannot confuse as acceptance of the status quo. Christians should make clear that the perpetuation of objectionable vaccines and the lack of alternatives is a kind of coercion. A strong Christian voice can restore a situation in which churches have nothing to do with abortion, no longer accepting health benefits at the cost of others’ lives.",['twist']

An upcoming CNN town hall on the coronavirus pandemic will feature 17-year-old Greta Thunberg alongside a panel of medical experts.
The program, “Coronavirus Facts and Fears,” also includes CNN broadcaster Sanjay Gupta, 50, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 71 and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Richard Besser, 60. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, 52, will host alongside Gupta.
However, social media watchdogs are foaming at the mouth over the choice to place a teen climate activist on a panel with public health experts.
GRETA THUNBERG BELIEVES SHE HAD CORONAVIRUS, SELF-ISOLATED AFTER SHOWING SYMPTOMS
“What place does Greta Thunberg have in this town hall?” asks Twitter rabble rouser Yashar Ali to his 618,000 followers. His rhetorical question was liked by more than 12,000 since this morning.
Her name is a top trending term on Twitter, with some 30,000 mentions on the platform in just a few hours.
In a follow-up tweet, Ali clarified his rhetorical tweet with an explanation: “I understand that but this is a panel of top health experts and administrators. A climate activist would be better suited on a different panel. She’s not a climate scientist. It’s a matter of placement.”
CNN’s social media was soon served with an onslaught of virtual eye-rolls.
“Greta Thunberg? Now, she’s a COVID expert? @CNN is a joke!” reads a top response to the network’s Wednesday announcement.
“Not picking on the kid,” said another. “Picking on a ‘news’ network for featuring a child to inform the public.”
GRETA THUNBERG SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CRITICS ARE ‘DESPERATE’ AFTER USING SEXUALLY GRAPHIC IMAGE OF HER
“I remember when my thread about E. coli in Romaine lettuce went viral and trended on Twitter only to have CNN put Food Babe on the air to discuss the issue,” tweeted Dr. Eugene Gu, referring to another controversial health “expert” in the media. “Greta Thunberg on this panel is an improvement from that at least.”
Some have come to Thunberg’s defense, including more than a few public figures, arguing that the voice of the youth, who will come to inherit an Earth doomed by future pandemics and climate disaster, may actually have something to add to the conversation.
“Unqualified men appear on cable all day every day, bloviating endlessly, but Greta Thunberg is a bridge too far? Ok,” tweeted writer Roxane Gay.
CLIMATE ACTIVIST GRETA THUNBERG GETTING HER OWN BBC DOCUMENTARY SERIES
“She’s has extraordinary knowledge and she is the next generation that is left to clean this mess we’ve made. They wouldn’t have her there if she wasn’t a powerful voice,” wrote Oscar-winning actor Patricia Arquette.
“It’s a town hall, not a meeting of scientists,” another follower noted. “Some of their previous guests have been chef Jose Andres, director Spike Lee, author Laurie Garrett, etc etc.”

Thunberg has, perhaps wisely, been mum throughout this erupting social-media showdown. But she hasn’t spent the past three months lounging in lockdown. On April 30, UNICEF said that the young activist had launched a children-first campaign to help protect young lives against COVID-19, pledging a grant of €92,000 ($100,000), awarded to her by Danish NGO Human Act, toward the effort.
“Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child-rights crisis,” said Thunberg. “It will affect all children, now and in the long-term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most. I’m asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF’s vital work to save children’s lives, to protect health and continue education.”

"A 10-hour hearing broadcast on the court’s website showed Sun, China's greatest ever swimmer, and one of its biggest sports stars, to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English.",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/olympic-swimming-sun-yang-banned-doping,fox-news,sport,right,32.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Chinese swimmer Sun Yang was banned for eight years on Friday and will miss the 2020 Tokyo Olympics because he broke anti-doping rules in a late-night incident in which a blood sample container was smashed with a hammer.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the three-time Olympic champion guilty of refusing to cooperate with sample collectors during a visit to his home in September 2018 that turned confrontational.
In a rare hearing in open court in November, evidence was presented of how a security guard instructed by Sun’s mother broke the casing around a vial of his blood. The swimmer lit the early-hours scene with his mobile phone.
“The athlete failed to establish that he had a compelling justification to destroy his sample collection containers and forego the doping control when, in his opinion, the collection protocol was not in compliance,” the CAS panel of three judges agreed in a unanimous verdict.
TOKYO ORGANIZERS, GOVERNMENT TAKE OFFENSIVE ON VIRUS THREAT
China's greatest ever swimmer, and one of its biggest sports stars, had asked CAS for a public trial.
A 10-hour hearing broadcast on the court’s website showed Sun to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. The CAS panel’s verdict was delayed until all parties got a verified translation.
The 6-foot, 7-inch (2-meter) Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win Olympic gold, has long been a polarizing figure in the pool.
Rivals branded him a drug cheat at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and two competitors refused to stand with him on medal podiums at the 2019 world championships.
Now banned until February 2028, the 28-year-old Sun cannot defend his 200-meter freestyle title in Tokyo.
TOKYO ORGANIZERS, IOC GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED WITH OLYMPICS
The World Anti-Doping Agency went to CAS after a FINA tribunal only warned Sun. The first ruling was that anti-doping protocol was not followed, making the samples invalid, and cited doubts about credentials shown to him by the sample collection team.
“WADA ... is satisfied that justice in this case has been rendered,” the body's director general Olivier Niggli said in a statement.
Sun can now appeal to Switzerland’s supreme court, but on narrow procedural grounds. His lawyers have already had three federal appeals dismissed on legal process issues.
WADA requested a ban of between two and eight years for a second doping conviction. Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 imposed by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a stimulant that was banned at the time. The ban was not announced until after it ended.
That first case led to criticism of FINA for appearing to protect one of the sport’s biggest stars in a key market.
Swimming's governing body said it will make a statement later Friday.
Sun never missed a major event while banned in 2014. He added 200 gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics to the historic 400 and 1,500 titles he took in London four years earlier.
'MIRACLE ON ICE' 40 YEARS AGO WAS SO GREAT, TWO MOVIES WERE MADE ABOUT IT
He won a total of 11 golds in five straight world championships from 2011 to 2019, at each freestyle distance from 200 to 1,500. At three Asian Games from 2010 to 2018, he won nine gold medals.
The court ruled Friday that Sun can retain the two world titles he won in South Korea last July while the WADA appeal case against him was pending.
Days after the 2018 Asian Games, Sun was visited at his home by three officials sent by a Swedish firm to get blood and urine samples from him. International athletes must notify where and when they will be available for one hour each day, and Sun had suggested late on Sept. 4.
When FINA prosecuted Sun following the incident, its tribunal panel in January 2019 merely warned Sun and cited doubts about the officials’ credentials.
Although Sun and his entourage, including his mother, were criticized for their conduct, the FINA panel said the sample mission was void because anti-doping protocol was not followed. Technically, Sun was judged to be not properly notified of needing to give samples.
In the CAS hearing, questioning by judges and WADA’s lawyers revealed skepticism that an experienced athlete could claim to be so unfamiliar with the process and the paperwork.

FINA and Sun’s legal team failed in pre-trial efforts to remove WADA’s lead prosecutor from the case. They argued there was a conflict of interest because of the lawyer’s previous work with FINA, but Sun’s appeal was dismissed by CAS at an earlier hearing.","['evasive', 'greatest', 'ever']"

Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, reacted: “This is vile. The President is co-opting the memory of George Floyd and exploiting the Black Lives Matter movement to praise the economy.” Her tweet appears to have been since deleted.

Other reporters simply clipped the quote where Trump referenced George Floyd, presenting it as if in reference to the jobs report and failing to include the context in which the president made it clear he was talking about justice and equal treatment by law enforcement. A longer clip reveals Trump’s actual meaning:
Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race color gender or creed. They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week; we can’t let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, ‘this is a great thing that’s happening for our country.’ It’s a great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody.

"But, yeah, good work each and every one of you reporters who made this fake story something to waste time on this week. You’re all hacks.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/04/3-ways-media-hacks-are-dangerously-politicizing-vaccines/,federalist,vaccines,right,32.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Last year the Centers for Disease Control reported 644 domestic cases of measles, a respiratory disease spread through the air. Already in January of this year there are 102 people in 14 states who have it, most of this related to being at Disneyland in mid-December. That’s the main reason why California has 92 of those 102 confirmed cases. The disease was eliminated in the United States by 2000 but can be brought back and spread via international travelers. All states have rules requiring a measles vaccine for children in public school but some exemptions are allowed. The exemptions are disconcerting to some.
We see stories such as this one from September in The Atlantic: “Wealthy L.A. Schools’ Vaccination Rates Are as Low as South Sudan’s: Hollywood parents say not vaccinating makes ‘instinctive’ sense.” The full story from The Hollywood Reporter is fascinating. More recently we saw this from a local CBS affiliate: “Berkeley’s Measles Ultimatum: 21-Day Quarantine For Unvaccinated Kids If Outbreak Spreads.” BuzzFeed notes that half of the children that attend some Marin County schools north of San Francisco are not vaccinated. The Washington Post notes that the California communities where anti-vaccinators cluster are also the most liberal, voting overwhelmingly for President Obama.
For some reason, many in the media (as well as other liberal commentators) decided to try to make this story about a measles outbreak in California and a concern about vaccination rates in Hollywood, Marin County and Berkeley into an existential problem for — stay with me here because it makes zero sense if you’re not a hack — the Republican Party and conservatives. It’s an odd, perhaps even desperate and clownish, choice. But such is what our political media does these days. See, for example, the completely manufactured and orchestrated “War on Women.”
Here are three obvious but important ways the media demonstrated a disgusting partisan slant instead of good journalism.
1. It is indefensible to spin this as a problem for Republicans.
What got liberals in the media going this week was a statement made by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican:
“Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated, and we think that it’s an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health,” the likely 2016 presidential candidate said while in Cambridge, England. The Republican also noted: “I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.”
Not three days earlier, we had this nearly identical statement from the White House, currently occupied by a Democrat. Nota bene: the President is actually the highest office in the land, even higher than the governor of New Jersey:
""Well, the President certainly believes that these kinds of decisions are decisions that should be made by parents, because ultimately when we’re talking about vaccinations, we’re typically talking about vaccinations that are given to children. But the science on this, as our public health professionals I’m sure would be happy to tell you, the science on this is really clear.""
Both President Obama and Gov. Christie are, in fact, articulating what is state policy in all 50 states. At least to some degree. All 50 states require vaccination and all 50 allow parents to opt-out for medical reasons. All but two allow opt-outs for religious or other reasons. The two that allow no non-medical opt-outs? The super-liberal Democratic states of … oh dear, this doesn’t fit the narrative at all, does it … Mississippi and West Virginia.
Now, outfits such as Mother Jones, Rolling Stone and Salon have all published anti-vaccination pieces in the past decade. The latter two, in fact, published a piece by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. You can probably guess a little something about his political affiliation. But that doesn’t mean that concerns about vaccination are exclusively on the left.
A late January survey by YouGov asked “Do you think early childhood vaccinations can cause autism?” The percentage who responded “definitely” or “probably”: 13% of Democrats, 15% of Independents and 11% of Republicans. It also asked, “When it comes to childhood diseases, like measles, mumps, and whooping cough, should all children be required to get vaccinations or should parents be able to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children?” More on the inadequacies of this question later, but 70% of Democrats, 48% of Independents and 57% of Republicans said it should be required. The survey asked “Have you received the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations?” Republicans were most likely to say yes, at 78%. Democrats and Independents were tied at 69%. Republicans were also most likely to say that they had vaccinated their children, with 88% saying they had, compared to 82% of Democrats with children and 79% of Independents. Finally, Republicans were also more informed about the measles outbreak, with 84% reporting they knew about it compared to 66% of Democrats and Independents. To put it mildly, this is not an issue on which you see a clear partisan divide, particularly not in one particular direction.
But many in our political media — not known for being deep thinkers but known for loving to play gotcha, no matter how little it brings to the discussion — decided that this issue of Berkeley, Marin County and Hollywood parents needed to be jujitsued into a problem for the GOP.
A perfect example comes from Jeremy W. Peters of the New York Times:
The politics of medicine, morality and free will collide as GOP debates itself again over established science: http://t.co/Ofd6v1fTzH
Jeremy W. Peters (@jwpetersNYT) February 3, 2015
Here’s some text from his story. Again, this is the New York Times and not Daily Kos diaries:
Oh for crying out loud. The desperation. Imagine if you got your news only from the New York Times, and how bigoted that would make you against non-liberals.
Anyway, Peters and other groupthinkers went around writing stories about how Republicans have some huge vaccine problem, facts be cast aside. And they went out of their way to ask GOP politicians questions about whether they agreed with this largely universal vaccination approach. But then they framed such agreement in the most nefarious of terms. This was only practiced on GOP politicians, mind you. Not Democrats.
Fun fact about Jeremy W. Peters. I tweeted:
New rule: 100% of journalists must ask 100% of Democrats when science says life begins before uttering the word “vaccine” even one more time
Mollie (@MZHemingway) February 3, 2015
A reader reminded me of a curious historical footnote. A few years ago John McCormack, a reporter for the Weekly Standard, asked Nancy Pelosi, “What is the moral difference between what Dr. Gosnell did to a baby born alive at 23 weeks and aborting her moments before birth?” Now, political journalists know that only pro-life candidates should be on the receiving end of difficult abortion questions. So it’s funny to note what the transcript of this reporter scrum says next (spoiler: Pelosi doesn’t answer the question and no other reporter presses it):
PELOSI: You're probably enjoying that question a lot, I can see you savoring it. [Laughter in press corps] Let me just tell you this.
Who was the reporter in question? It was Peters. Peters bust a gut laughing. Isn’t that so weird? That the same reporter who is making up crap about vaccines being a political problem for Republicans would help out Nancy Pelosi when a single reporter asks her a tough question about her radical abortion stance? That is so weird!
But, yeah, good work each and every one of you reporters who made this fake story something to waste time on this week. You’re all hacks.
2. Hypocrisy in pandemic fear
Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, sore throat and all-over body rash. According to the Washington Post:
Fatalities are rare in the United States, but one or two of every 1,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease, according to Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. More common complications include pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and deafness. Pregnant women who get the measles may give birth prematurely or deliver low-birth-weight babies.
Symptoms of Ebola include, according to the CDC:
Fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal (stomach) pain, unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or bruising).
The fatality rate for Ebola cases from last year is 71%, according to the CDC.
No one wants to get measles, a disease we know a fair bit about and which many Americans of a certain age contracted as children. But it doesn’t even come close to the scare of getting Ebola and having it liquify your organs.
Remember how the media treated Americans who were a bit freaked out about the spread of Ebola? I do. See “Media Should Stop Lecturing Americans About Their Ebola Concerns” and “Media’s ‘Panic Panic’ Is Reaching New Annoying Levels With Quarantines.” The joke of a site PolitiFact even made concerns about Ebola it’s “Lie of the Year.”
You may remember that NBC journalist Nancy Snyderman broke her Ebola quarantine, to the outrage of her neighbors. You will never believe what she tweeted this week:
When free will trumps public health we put our nation's most vulnerable at risk. That doesn't seem very American to me. Vaccinate #measles
Dr. Nancy Snyderman (@DrNancyNBCNEWS) February 3, 2015
Yes, the same woman who broke her Ebola quarantine wrote that tweet.
On that note, remember the media outrage when certain governors took the Ebola threat more seriously than some in the media? It was crazy. Read this link for some of the details, but a nurse who was quarantined by Chris Christie said her human rights had been violated. Various reporters were absolutely outraged that readers didn’t seem to care about this.
But now that you have certain politicians saying it’s important to balance public health programs with concerns about liberty, the media are in full-on panic mode, writing as many stories they can about how Sen. Rand Paul is the world’s greatest threat. Here, for example is how one journalist responded to a tweet by Rand Paul (since deleted and language warning).
Talk about hysteria.
Listen, I’m generally on the side of people who fear bad diseases, whether they’re the liquifying organs kind or the bad rash on your body kind, and whether there’s a widespread vaccine in use against it or not. But could we get some consistency here? A standard other than the “be on the side that hurts Republicans” standard the media are experts in?
3. Defining the terms
NPR had an interesting story four years ago about vaccination and public health threats. Here’s a portion of the discussion with Michael Willrich, author of “Pox: An American History.”
From the very start of the organized vaccination campaign against smallpox, there was public resistance, says Willrich. The battle between the government and the vocal anti-vaccinators came to a head in a landmark 1902 Supreme Court decision, where the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state to order a vaccination for its population during an epidemic to protect the people from a devastating disease. ""But at the same time, the Court recognized certain limitations on that power — that this power of health policing was no absolute and was not total and there was a sphere of individual liberty that needed to be recognized,"" says Willrich. ""Measures like this needed to be reasonable and someone who could make a legitimate claim that a vaccine posed a particular risk to them because of their family history or medical history [would not have to be vaccinated.]"" In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stipulated that a state couldn't forcibly vaccinate its population. ""[They said,] 'Of course, it would be unconstitutional and go beyond the pale for health officials to forcibly vaccinate anyone because that's not within their power,'"" says Willrich. ""And I think that's really a shoutout to the Boston health authorities who were employing forcible vaccination all the time in the poorest neighborhoods in the city.""
Would these court decisions be called “anti-vaxxer,” the media adjective du jour? Consider this tweet from BuzzFeed’s Adam Serwer:
here's a weird CW that anti vaxxers are mostly lefties but it's a ver bipartisan fringe http://t.co/tCtYOnnGdr pic.twitter.com/CotlsRys57
Adam Serwer (@AdamSerwer) February 3, 2015
Leaving aside the idea that 26% to 30% of a group could be described as fringe, what we see is a conflation of opposition to vaccines with opposition to forced government vaccination. Here might be another example.
What does “mandatory” vaccination mean? Does it mean something that allows that the “power of health policing is not absolute” as the Courts might say? Or does it mean we fine and jail parents who choose not to vaccinate their children? Does it mean we take children away from parents who don’t vaccinate? Or does it mean we don’t allow non-vaccinated children in public schools?
Does it matter why parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children? Is it because they have moral objections to using vaccines developed from aborted babies? Is it because their child has medical problems that would be compounded by a vaccine injection? Is it because they’re philosophically opposed to medicine? Is it because they believe discredited studies about a link between autism and vaccines? What lines should be drawn?
I get that the media really want to do some bullcrap horse-race point-scoring partisan sniping right now. But these are actually important questions. And “gotcha” reporting may get you butt-slapped by your fellow reporters at the bar, but it’s actually really dangerous.
Vaccinations are too important to be sucked into a politicized debate and the media should be ashamed for trying so hard to make it so. Vaccines are one of the most agreed-upon topics regardless of political leaning. We already mandate vaccinations in 50 states. Journalistic discussion of whether the exemptions to these mandates are too broad or too narrow is legitimate, even if media panic seems a bit overwrought right now. There is no way that debate goes well if it becomes the media’s next “War on Women” type exercise of water carrying for Democrats.","['fake', 'story', 'hacks']"
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Thursday released a sweeping immigration plan that would dramatically increase the number of refugee admissions by nearly 800 percent from FY 2018 and 250 percent from the Obama years.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-wants-to-increase-annual-refugee-admissions-nearly-800-percent-from-fy2018,fox-news,immigration,right,32.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Thursday released a sweeping immigration plan that would dramatically increase the number of refugee admissions by nearly 800 percent from FY 2018 and 250 percent from the Obama years.
By the end of her first term, Warren said she would increase admissions to 175,000 per year with a ceiling of 125,000 in her first year in the White House. That first figure would be a massive increase (795 percent) over the roughly 22,000 admitted in FY2018 -- a result of President Trump's restrictionist approach that Warren decried on Thursday.
""At a time when 70 million are displaced around the world, President Trump has abused his authority to lower the refugee cap for the United States, admitting just over 22,000 refugees in total last year,"" she said in her proposal.
The Trump administration has seen record lows in refugee admissions as it enacted bans on entry from a series of countries in the Middle East. Refugees have become a hot button issue as millions attempted to flee the terrorist group ISIS and the southern border was swamped with asylum claims.

Trump has cautioned against allowing massive numbers of refugees to resettle through a vetting process that he and others have argued was inadequate for weeding out major security threats.
In the midst of the refugee crisis, former President Obama's administration welcomed 84,995 refugees in FY2016. That was slightly higher than the annual rate of 70,000 -- about 250 percent lower than Warren's goal of 175,000 -- that his administration said it had welcomed in the preceding years.
He also set a ceiling of 110,000 for FY2017 but Trump reduced that to 50,000 -- slightly higher than the 45,000 limit he set for FY2018. That was the lowest refugee ceiling since 1980, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Warren's plan included a host of other policies that will likely find favor with other Democratic politicians. Among other things, she wants to repeal a law requiring local police to enforce federal immigration laws as well as end ""unnecessary"" detention.

""We already have the tools to effectively track and monitor individuals without shoving them into cages and camps along the border,"" she said. ""As President, I’ll issue guidance ensuring that detention is only used where it is actually necessary because an individual poses a flight or safety risk.""
It's unclear how many migrants Warren's team expected to detain or how they would handle those who crossed the border illegally but weren't deemed a flight or safety risk.
Trump's administration has come under fire from Warren and others for the allegedly inhumane conditions set up for migrants. Warren's plan would also institute a Justice Department task force to investigate allegations like medical neglect and sexual assaults, and have the authority to ""pursue any substantiated criminal allegations.""
Current and former immigration officials have pushed back on some of the detention depictions while the administration has blamed Democrats for, they say, failing to pass reforms that would fix the detention system.

""Let there be no ambiguity on this: if you are violating the basic rights of immigrants, now or in the future, a Warren administration will hold you accountable,"" she said.
Legal immigration would also expand under a Warren administration which would also decriminalize illegal border crossings. In lieu of legislation providing a path to citizenship, Warren said she would ""take executive action to provide a measure of protection for those who are undocumented.""
""I’ll work with Congress to pass broad-reaching reform, but I’m also prepared to move forward with executive action if Congress refuses to act,"" she said in her proposal.

Her plan came amid news that the administration would follow through on initially-delayed deportation raids across the U.S., targeting 2,000 immigrants who already faced orders for deportation.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) predicted that a ban on fracking and new oil leases would reduce GDP by $7.1 trillion by 2030, cost the economy 7.5 million jobs by 2022, and cause an average household income decline of $5,040. While energy consumption would decline by 12 percent, energy costs will purportedly increase by 14 percent.
API's estimates were released two days before South Carolina's Democratic primary, where the candidates will compete with platforms that push aggressive agendas on energy and the environment.
Both Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have endorsed fracking bans, along with the sweeping ""Green New Deal.""
RICK PERRY SAYS TRUMP ADMIN MADE US ENERGY A SUCCESS
A study released on Wednesday by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) projected that the Green New Deal would also inflict a hefty cost on American voters, finding that swing-state households would face around $75,000 in costs during the first year of the plan's implementation.
According to API's estimates, Kansas, North Dakota, Colorado, West Virginia, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and New Mexico would face the most job losses as a share of overall employment.
Texas would see the greatest amount of total job losses (1,103,000), followed by California (765,000) and the battleground states of Florida (711,000), Pennsylvania (551,000), and Ohio (500,000).
Progressives have criticized fracking as a potential source of pollution and dangerous to the environment. Conservatives, however, have defended the practice for its impact on economic and job growth, as well as American energy independence.

In November, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry told Fox News in November that American fracking had also helped loosen Russia's grip on Europe's energy supply.
""Not only are they not held hostage by Russian gas, they're also saving money,"" he told Fox News' Ed Henry at the time. That same month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said a ban on fracking would ""not be a good thing for the economy.""
Both API and energy consulting firm OnLocation Inc. credited fracking with massive changes in America's energy supply. “You can’t eliminate the very technology that has enabled the American energy revolution without damaging economic consequences,” said Lessly Goudarzi, founder and CEO of OnLocation, Inc.

On Tuesday, Sanders released more details about how he proposed to pay for his version of the Green New Deal, which he says would cost $16.3 trillion.

Sanders also warned that without action on climate change, the U.S. will ""lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century"" and predicted savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by ""averting climate catastrophe.""",['aggressive']

Ralph Northam determined that citizens should not be allowed to attend church or worship services, but are fine travel to an abortion clinic and undergo an elective procedure like surgical abortion.
On Monday, March 23, Northam instituted an executive order making it a criminal offense to hold or attend a church service with more than 10 people.
The mandate classifies attending a church service with more than 10 individuals as a class one misdemeanor. Punishment for a class one misdemeanor includes jail time for a maximum of 12 months and a maximum fine of $2,500.
Two days later, Wednesday, March 25, Northam directed all hospitals and health care providers to stop performing elective surgeries or procedures in an effort to conserve supply of personal protective equipment and to make space for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. But the governor’s directive exempted “family planning services,” which includes abortion giant Planned Parenthood.
According to Planned Parenthood office in Roanoke, Virginia, the abortion giant will continue to perform abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming abortion is an “essential” medical service.
Governors in other states such as Tennessee, Ohio, and Texas determined an abortion to be an “elective” service. As states work to ensure their ICUs and ERs can handle a surge of coronavirus cases, the goal of temporarily stopping abortion procedures is to prevent women from having to visit contagious ERs, in the event of a botched surgical or chemical abortion. Even women who receive non-surgical or chemical abortions face common side effects like incomplete abortions, hemorrhaging, and infection. These women, especially poor women, ultimately seek treatment in emergency rooms. Some studies have shown that as many as 5 to 7 percent of all women obtaining chemical abortions will require surgical procedures.
Additionally, these states want to halt any unnecessary procedures that would divert the use of masks, gloves, and other critical personal protective equipment away from doctors and nurses who desperately need them while treating contagious corona virus patients.
Northam, who advocated for late term abortion and infanticide in 2019, is more willing to throw Christians or other religious gatherers into jail over meeting with 11 fellow believers than he is to protect to the lives of health care workers and pregnant women.","['abortion', 'essential']"

"Of all the pandering showcased during Democrats’ attempts to win back the presidency, wiping out student debt ranked at or near the top.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/15/student-debt-willingly-took-not-problem-solve/,federalist,student-debt,right,33.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Of all the pandering showcased during Democrats’ attempts to win back the presidency, wiping out student debt ranked at or near the top.
“I believe that education is the future for this country,” socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders barked during the first round of Democratic primary debates, explaining that’s why we must “eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke similarly. “I can tell you this,” the Minnesota senator demagogued, “if billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.”
There can be no serious discussion of this issue, however, in 60-second sound bites. So, beyond the soak-the-rich shtick that shades every Democratic economic debate point, the candidates resorted to two tactics: shock and sob stories.
The Shock Strategy
The size of student debt provides the jolt necessary to peddle their plans to the American populace. “I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself,” California Rep. Eric Swalwell bemoaned. “College affordability is personal for us,” South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared, noting that his household has “six-figure student debt.” So, sure, “I believe in reducing student debt,” Buttigieg announced.
Next came the sob stories. Those student loans are suffocating a generation, the candidates suggested. After all, “40 million of us who can’t start a family,” the diaper-changing daddy Swalwell contradictorily proclaimed, adding that they “Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.”
“We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on,” frontrunner Joe Biden agreed.
Tellingly, when not constrained by the debate format, these same politicians push the same narrative to garner support for bailing out student loans, all while the media provides the Democrats a free assist.
“With loans totaling more than $130,000,” Buttigieg’s household is “among the 43 million people in the United States who owe federal student loan debt,” the Associated Press reported last month, before highlighting the myriad plans to bail out student debt pushed by a cadre of presidential candidates. The AP then furthered the narrative by using statistics to shock the public into socialism:
The debtors are so numerous and the total debt so high—more than $1.447 trillion, according to federal statistics—that several of the Democratic candidates have made major policy proposals to address the crisis. Their ideas include wiping away debt, lowering interest rates, expanding programs that tie repayment terms to income and making college free or debt-free. Student loan debt is often discussed as an issue that mostly affects millennials, but it cuts across age groups. Federal statistics show that about 7.8 million people age 50 and older owe a combined $291.9 billion in student loans. People age 35 to 49, a group that covers older millennials such as Buttigieg as well as Generation X, owe $548.4 billion. That group includes more than 14 million people.
Sob Stories Reign Supreme
Then the sad tales continue the sales pitch for a government solution to student debt—a ploy that began well before the 2016 elections. Here’s one of myriad media examples.
“Shayna Pilnick, 28, would like to buy an apartment but can’t afford a mortgage. Jacqueline Mannino, 23, and her boyfriend, Benjamin Prowse, 26, want to get married. Jacob Childerson, 24, and his wife, Jennifer, 25, wish they could start a family, but they live with Jennifer’s parents,” is how USA Today opened its 2013 profile of millennials unable to obtain their dream life because they are “tethered” to “tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.”
There are many ways to counter these arguments, based on both economics and equity. But it’s hard to counter soundbites with sense, so instead, here are my inquiries for these politicians, the press, and all the students demanding relief from the burdens of their debt: Tell me your sob stories from age 12 on, not what you can’t do now, but what you couldn’t do then. Tell what you had to do then and through college to avoid what is now, to you, crushing student debt.
What time did you get up to deliver papers in junior high? How many hours a week did you work since 14 to save for college? How many toilets did you scrub? How many high school football games did you miss because you were working? What dream college did you forgo to avoid taking out student loans?
Which 8 a.m. class did you take so you could complete your major’s requirements and still work in the afternoon? Which bus line did you take to get to your job because you didn’t borrow to buy a car? What job did you work full-time while completing your MBA at night?
What did you do to afford college? What didn’t you do because of the cost of college? Were you getting tattoos and traveling your way through college? Were you pledging and partying? Did you go to your top-choice university? Maybe an out-of-state public university with higher tuition rates? Which spring break and study abroad destinations did you visit along the way?
Did you splurge on your fairytale wedding instead of paying down your student loans? What cars did you buy or lease? Where did you live? What electronics did you own? What clothing and other personal expenditures did you have? In short, show me the money and how you spent it!
None of my business? You’re right. Nor is your student debt my business or my problem.",['pandering']

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) radical climate change position and his own.
Biden spoke to a group in Keene as part of his brief blitz through the Granite State, telling the crowd he has “no middle ground” on climate change and getting heckled for it.
“I don’t have a middle ground. I have the most forward – Okay look all right look,” Biden said as the heckler shouted “no fracking!”
“We can talk later. I’m happy to talk to you about it in detail … by the way, I agree with it,” Biden added:
This would not be the first time Biden has been criticized for his ideas on combatting climate change, which – in the past – have paled in comparison to the ideas offered by ultra-progressive Sanders, who rolled out a massive $16 trillion Green New Deal plan this week.
Ocasio-Cortez – a champion of the Green New Deal – seemingly dissed Biden’s initial proposal, which included a $1.7 trillion plan to “invest in a clean energy economy” with a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
The freshman lawmaker said his plan, particularly his goal of zero net emissions by 2050, is “too late.”
“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said, according to the Hill.
“It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem,” she added.
Sanders’ official plan, in contrast, calls for a $16.3 trillion public investment, which expands existing entitlement programs by billions.
As Breitbart News reported:
Sanders says we must “directly invest a historic $16.3 trillion public investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past.” However, he claims the investment will effectively “pay for itself” over 15 years and that the price of inaction will cost far more, citing experts who say that doing nothing will cost the U.S. “$34.5 trillion in economic activity” by 2100. He plans to pay for the $16.3 trillion plan with additional taxes on the fossil fuel industry, and he plans to “prosecute and sue” them for the damage ravaged on the planet.
Sanders’ exhaustive plan covers virtually every angle of the climate change “crisis,” from promising to “fully electrify and decarbonize” the transportation sector, to investing $1.12 billion in “tribal land access and extension programs,” to providing “oral translation assistance to USDA, FDA, and DOJ offices for non-English speaking farmers,” to pouring $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund.
Biden signaled a more radical shift during the last debate, telling moderator Dana Bash that his administration would work to eliminate fossil fuels.
“Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in a Biden administration?” Bash asked.
“No. We would work it out. We would make sure it’s eliminated, and no more subsidies for either one of those, any fossil fuel,” Biden said.
By contrast, Biden told voters in 2008 that he and former President Barack Obama supported “clean coal,” and he repeated the same sentiment in 2012:

However, in recent weeks, Biden has – seemingly – shifted to more radical positions, matching the likes of Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and Sanders.
“We have to make clear that climate change covers a whole range of things,” Biden told Valley News ahead of a forum at Dartmouth College Friday. “Climate change is a public health risk.”
He even echoed Sanders, who once called climate change a greater national security threat than ISIS or Al Qaeda.
“Four years ago I came here to Iowa and I was asked what is the major national security issue we face? And people thought I’d say ISIS or Al Qaeda, and those are big issues,” Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, this month.
“The answer that I gave, in terms of national security, is climate change,” he added:
Bernie Sanders: climate change is a bigger national security threat than Al-Qaeda & ISIShttps://t.co/9RVjvyNmRR pic.twitter.com/49K3jAXvlN — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) August 11, 2019
“I put climate change at the top of my list. It’s the single biggest existential threat out there,” Biden told Valley News, echoing Sanders and mentioning a ten-year deadline:
We have, probably, ten years to keep the changes from being irreversible. The floods in the Midwest this summer rendered seven of our military bases useless for a while. … When President (Barack) Obama and I were first elected and we were briefed by the Defense Department, the first thing they wanted to talk about, the single greatest threat to national security, was climate change. They showed us the projections for mass migrations, and today we’re seeing more mass migrations since anytime since World War II.
Given Biden’s latest admission in Keene, NH, it remains unclear if he does, in fact, agree with Sanders’ more radical approach to tackling climate change.","['paled', 'ultra-progressive']"

The results are in, and the socialist swept Nevada. That’s right, Bernie Sanders soared to victory Saturday for his third straight win — first Iowa, then New Hampshire, and now the Silver State. Things are looking pretty good for the Vermont senator, the 2020 presidential front-runner who leads second-place candidate and gaffe-machine Joe Biden by more than 12 points in the latest polls.
Notwithstanding the media’s endless campaign to smear Sanders, his support is stronger than ever — and, it appears, so is he. Despite a health scare in October, Sanders soldiers on determined and forceful at his rallies and on the debate stage. Next to the former vice president, Sanders presents like a spring chicken.
But aside from his physical resilience, how is he doing so well? He’s a 78-year-old white male millionaire seeking the affections of the wokesters, a gruff socialist with bedraggled hair and terrifying policy proposals, a 2016 presidential reject, and a divisive populist — which, in case you hadn’t noticed, we already have one of those.
Sanders praises the radical Green New Deal, champions a Medicare for All plan with a $34 trillion price tag, nods to abortion as a means of population control, and defends bread lines and Fidel Castro’s Cuba.

Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display. Every time Sanders opens his mouth, I believe he believes everything he’s saying. Unlike Obama-wannabe Buttigieg, Sanders feels real. His authentic brand is a perfect blend of “I wrote the damn bill!” fire and witty one-liners. Passion over pandering. Compassion over calculation. Compared to the other candidates, Sanders is the obvious choice.
Sanders Is So Much Stronger Than Biden
Biden is struggling. With each debate, he appears increasingly frail, lacking the crucial stamina Sanders would bring against President Donald Trump in a general election. Since the beginning, Biden has been grasping at the coattails of America’s first black president and relying on his administration’s laurels related to Obamacare, race relations, gun restrictions, and climate change. He’s flaky, having flip-flopped his stance on China and the Hyde amendment, which bars the use of federal funding for abortion in most circumstances.
Biden’s Hyde reversal was “never a good thing in politics,” said David Axelrod, an Obama senior adviser. “And it raises questions about his own performance and his own steadiness and his campaign’s performance.”
This isn’t to say Sanders’ policy has undergone zero evolution over his long tenure in the public eye. Critics assailed him during the 2016 cycle, saying he flipped on gun control and health care, switching from a state-run model to favoring federal administration. But unlike other 2020 contenders, Sanders says what he means and means what he says, remaining overwhelmingly consistent in his advocacy even if his forecasted outcomes for democratic socialism are irrational.
Biden’s endless lane-changing between moderate and progressive induces unpredictable whiplash. In 2020, voters know Sanders offers a much smoother ride.
Michael Bloomberg Can’t Keep up with Bernie
Speaking of whiplash, let’s talk about Michael Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat. Bloomberg may be outspending every other candidate by vast margins, but his Super Tuesday strategy, resulting in a non-presence in all but the last debate and absence in Iowa and New Hampshire, isn’t a great look.
“In Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states in the presidential nomination process, candidates brave freezing temperatures to get out and shake hands. In those states, voters don’t expect to be won over with ad buys and policy papers, they want to meet the candidates personally and be wooed,” wrote Rich Cromwell in The Federalist this month. “Mike Bloomberg doesn’t have time for that.”
Not the case with Sanders, who called out Bloomberg for his absence. “I didn’t see Mike in Iowa when we were holding town meetings with folks there,” Sanders said. “Didn’t see him in New Hampshire, hey you know what, I didn’t see him here in Nevada. Didn’t see him in South Carolina. But he thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.”
Not to mention, Bloomberg’s first debate showing was abysmal — while Sanders never broke stride, even ripping Bloomberg for his filthy billions.
Sanders Discards Buttigieg and Warren Robotics
At her peak, Elizabeth Warren led Sanders in the polls by 12 full points, and now she trails him by over 16 points. In an intersectionality battle, Warren should come out on top, but she isn’t. And it isn’t as if the two progressive icons are running on vastly different policy platforms.
Unlike Sanders, Warren wreaks of insincerity. If she can’t even be honest about her heritage, how are voters supposed to trust her promises and endless plans? Despite her best efforts to appear nonchalant and relatable — think Instagram beer video — Warren just can’t quite get the authenticity thing down. It’s as if all her rehearsed-to-appear-unrehearsed talking points pass through a cringe machine on the way out of her mouth.

Former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg is another robotics champion. The media has propped up Buttigieg as smooth and articulate, but his once-punchy and polished phrases, such as “future former Republicans” and “God doesn’t belong to a political party,” are tired. The novelty has worn off. Having apparently learned nothing from the failed campaigns of Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro, Buttigieg continues “Hispandering” in a way that feels forced.

But authenticity matters to voters, and they seem to see it in Sanders. One of Sanders’ volunteers, 33-year-old Shawn Nevarro, thinks of Sanders like a grandfather. “He’s kind of stern, a little grumpy at times. But, at the same time, you really know he’s looking out for you,” Nevarro said recently after a Nevada Spanish-language campaign event. “There is a huge distrust among the Latinx community with the Democratic party that they’re not following through on their promises. … Bernie is the exact opposite. He has a real authenticity.”
That authenticity could shore up the nomination for Bernie Sanders. Wonks in Washington, journalists buzzing around D.C. newsrooms, Twitter pundits, and campaign strategists would all do well to realize most people vote with their gut. They care more about who candidates are than what they say. Donald Trump wasn’t the smoothest candidate in 2016. He didn’t do Instagram lives from his kitchen, didn’t break out in Spanish at his rallies. He made forgotten voters believe he cared about them — because he did. And now Sanders is doing the same. So far, it’s paying off.",['radical']
Emilie Kao went on to note that women’s sports has already been undermined by the transgender movement.,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/05/16/duke-professor-the-equalityact-will-be-the-end-of-girls-and-womens-only-sports/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,33.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As Congress begins debating the Equality Act, the Heritage Foundation warns that if the bill becomes law it will prove the death knell for women’s sports.

#TitleIX required schools to establish separate women's sports teams to receive federal funding.

But Congress will vote this week on the #EqualityAct, which in the words of Duke Professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman ""will be the end of girl's and women's only sports."" Here's how: https://t.co/MigGwDsZFv — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 16, 2019
Title IX required schools to establish separate women’s sports teams for federal funding, but the Equality Act will seriously undermine that, Heritage added.
“The Equality Act would redefine sex in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, basing it not on biology, but on self-perceived gender identity,” Emilie Kao wrote.
Kao went on to note that women’s sports has already been undermined by the transgender movement.
Female athletes nationwide are already losing to males who argue that sex-segregated sports is unfair discrimination. But athletes who identify as the opposite sex aren’t excluded from competing against their physical equals. Instead, they are seeking to compete in categories created to provide an equal playing field for all athletes.
Some female athletes have spoken out about the transgender movement as it affects women’s sports.
World-record runner Paula Radcliffe said that opening women’s sports to men who “self-identify” as women necessarily cuts women out “due to the added numbers achieving” women’s records.
“The Equality Act isn’t about including those who were unfairly excluded from sports. It’s about meeting the demands of a powerful political group for unfair advantage. This politicizes sports, and there is no clear limit to where that will end,” Kao writes.
If one athlete can identify as the opposite sex, then why can’t another identify as a different age? The unfairness of allowing someone born with male physiology to compete against women should be as obvious as that of allowing adults to compete against children. Fairness requires that rules be based on physical realities. The Civil Rights Act addressed the illegitimate exclusion from educational opportunities on the basis of an immutable characteristic race. But in sports, sex and age are two legitimate categories upon which rules should be based. Sex differences determine performance.
To wrap up her piece, Kao noted that the level of testosterone that naturally occurs in women “(2.4 nanomoles per liter (npl)) does not even reach the floor for men’s testosterone levels (10 npl).”
“We should treat people suffering gender dysphoria with compassion and respect. But that doesn’t mean legislators should pass laws that put female athletes at such a disadvantage,” she said.
It comes down to a choice between politics and sports. Supporters of the Equality Act should listen to the female high school runners in Connecticut who describe losing to transgender athletes as “heartbreaking.” Will Congress turn the clock back by denying these girls the opportunity to compete against their own sex? Or can we keep politics out of sports so both men and women can play to win?
There are a few voices in women’s sports finally speaking out about transgenderism in sports.
Tennis great Martina Navratilova, for instance, has criticized the idea.
“Letting men compete as women simply if they change their name and take hormones is unfair — no matter how those athletes may throw their weight around,” Navratilova said of transgender players’ efforts to be recognized under their “chosen” gender.
British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies also slammed the concept of transgender athletes.
“I just don’t understand how anyone can say this is a level & fair playing field,” Davies tweeted. “1000% increase in trans women taking part in sport recently. It’s a serious topic that has to be honestly dealt with for safety as much as integrity #fairplay.”

Big-name White House hopefuls have thrown their support behind the pricey proposal aimed at combatting climate change introduced by freshman star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. Critics say it could cost as much as $93 trillion, or approximately $600,000 per household.
The staggering cost estimate comes from a new study co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

But a Pew Research Center poll this month found the issue of climate change ranked 17th on a list of what President Trump and Congress should make a top priority this year.
Just 44 percent of those who responded said climate change should be a top priority, well below the 70 percent who want the economy to be the focus.
However, 56 percent did say the environment should be a top focus – which was the 8th highest-ranked response in the poll.
Along with the economy, health care costs, education, terrorism, and Social Security rounded out the top five.
GILLIBRAND DEFENDS GREEN NEW DEAL, CALL CLIMATE CHANGE 'GREATEST THREAT TO HUMANITY WE HAVE'
Earlier this month, Ocasio-Cortez ramped up the rhetoric in pushing for the Green New Deal, calling it a “life and death” issue in a series of tweets.
“Don’t mess with our future. When it comes to climate, it’s all our lives at stake. The younger you are, the more consequences you’ll see. It’s life and death for us. And we will fight like it,” she tweeted.

During the riots, a large part of the protesters’ grievances came from the fact that they, as the people at the bottom, suffered most of the pain caused by the novel coronavirus epidemic. Because the campaign strategy of the president’s team is to downplay the pain of the epidemic, the White House has rarely mentioned the epidemic in the past week, except when it needed to exploit the virus to attack China. The US is not there for ethnic minorities and poor people. Through the epidemic and the attitude of the ruling elites in the riots, people can see that these groups live in desperation. Because the poor have no way to unite under the US system and can easily be divided, their common dissatisfaction has a limited impact on elections, and they have never become the focus of attention of policymakers. China’s massive poverty alleviation program is just unthinkable in the US. The frosty attitude of capitalism against the vulnerable groups has been laid bare in the past few months. The poor in the US are experiencing a very bad 2020.
According to the Global Times, this sorry state of affairs in the United States is an inevitable result of multi-party democracy. If America was smart and had only a single party like China, partisan squabbles would be ended and so much more could be done for the poor by their efficient and unified authoritarian government.
“Partisan politics has created severe divisions in society,” the Communist paper lectured. “Such divisions restrict and disturb people’s thinking. People’s support for a particular party is only a matter of stance, which provides a shelter to politicians who violate people’s interests. As elections come and go, it is simply about one group of elites replacing the other. The intertwined interests between the two groups are much greater than those between the victorious one and the electorate who vote for them.”
China appears to be feeding off similar complaints from the left in the United States. Complaints about partisan “gridlock” are perennial and grow especially loud when Democrats and their highly sympathetic media are the ones complaining about Republicans getting in their way. Left-wingers daydreamed during the Obama years about how much good their noble president could do if he possessed the dictatorial powers of Chinese dictator Xi Jinping.
“One-party autocracy certainly has its drawbacks. But when it is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people, as China is today, it can also have great advantages,” New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote in September 2009, laying out the thesis for much of his political coverage of the Obama administration.
It will come as a great disappointment to those who share Friedman’s admiration for the reasonably enlightened rulers of China that they do not think much of how Barack Obama handled racial issues during his presidency.
Another Global Times editorial on Tuesday chided the American media for forgetting that “the country’s escalating racial tension is not only Trump’s fault,” but also “stems from years of negligence by the Obama administration.”
The Global Times cited polls that showed “one of the highest levels of discord since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles” was reached during the last year of the Obama administration and that Americans were generally disappointed with Obama’s handling of racial issues at the end of his term compared to their lofty expectations at the beginning. It further quoted a BBC analysis that dinged Obama for being in charge when the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement began.
“With these facts and arguments in mind, it is reasonable to doubt a Biden presidency, should he win this November, will put more focus on healing race relations than Obama’s two terms of presidency – especially with the coronavirus still wreaking havoc throughout the country and a roiling recession with no easy end in sight,” the CCP paper said.
“The fact that George Floyd’s tragic death happened in a ‘blue state,’ in a Democrat-controlled city, is adding another layer of doubt whether a Biden presidency will offer anything significant better than Obama, or Trump,” the Global Times added.
The article concluded with another variation on the CCP’s theme that the American system is inferior to China’s brand of one-party fascist rule: “African Americans, as well as other minorities who suffer inequality, won’t see their agony end if they are stuck choosing either group of politicians.

Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.","['clear', 'useless', 'lacks']"
Officials at Dartmouth College looked the other way this week when a group of leftist student activists disrupted classes to bring attention to their support for the Green New Deal.,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/02/11/dartmouth-officials-allow-green-new-deal-protesters-to-crash-classes/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,environment,right,35.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Officials at Dartmouth College looked the other way this week when a group of leftist student activists disrupted classes to bring attention to their support for the Green New Deal.
According to a report by the College Fix, students at Dartmouth College are interrupting classes to promote leftist agendas. Many of the student activists have focused their recent efforts on promoting the Green New Deal in classrooms around Dartmouth’s campus.
The practice of disrupting class to promote leftist causes was chronicled in the Dartmouth Review at the end of January. The report by Kevin W. Berguis describes a student named Katie that would frequently interrupt classes and guilt professors into letting her use class time to promote her causes.
For months, Katie has been entering classes to advocate her organization’s left-wing agenda. The process usually begins as follows. Once class begins, Katie spontaneously arrives, where she asks the professor if she can give a quick presentation. The professor, often reluctant to say no, begrudgingly complies, allowing her to deliver her message. My first encounter with Katie was when she visited my Geography 18: Urbanization & the Environment class. She proceeded to introduce herself and share the “really great things” her organization advocates for, also known as the leftist laundry list. Then, she asked us to fill out cards, on which we were to indicate political matters important to us from a list of options, as well as provide our contact information. As seen in the card photo, the selection of issues is heavily slanted—of course there is no mention of the economy or immigration enforcement, since such concepts do not exist within the increasingly leftwards-shifting Democratic Party.
However, Katie, whose last name was omitted from the report, is not even a student at Dartmouth College. Despite this, many students have reported that their professors have permitted Katie to interrupt their classes to discuss the leftist agenda.
Breitbart News reported in January that a department chair at Dartmouth College committed suicide after he was reportedly falsely accused of mishandling a report of sexual misconduct against one of his colleagues.","['leftist', 'disrupted', 'other', 'way']"

The article concluded with another variation on the CCP’s theme that the American system is inferior to China’s brand of one-party fascist rule: “African Americans, as well as other minorities who suffer inequality, won’t see their agony end if they are stuck choosing either group of politicians. But what other option do they have?”","['bursting', 'tossed', 'few', 'bricks', 'needling', 'half-hearted', 'socialism', 'vastly', 'superior']"
Maynor’s story underscores a harsh reality: Youth sports is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and not every kid has the chance to participate.,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/youth-sports-17-billion-industry-human-cost,fox-news,sport,right,35.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"NEW YORK CITY — Maynor Palacios was wandering the sports fields of Randall’s Island in New York City when a kindhearted coach invited him to kick around the ball with young players from a competitive, privately-run soccer club. Not long thereafter, in July 2018, Maynor — the 14-year-old son of Honduran immigrants — helped lead that team to victory at the U.S. Club Soccer National Championships in Colorado.
The opportunity to play might never have been possible if not for scholarship money from Stars Premiere, the advanced program of Super Soccer Stars, the largest corporately-run youth soccer program in the country.
Maynor’s story underscores a harsh reality: Youth sports is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and not every kid has the chance to participate.
“My mom didn’t have that much money,” Maynor said in an interview with Fox News. “If I didn’t get accepted for that team, then I was not going to be playing soccer.”
The costs of year-round training programs, travel, equipment, facility and coaching fees have turned youth sports into a $17 billion-a-year industry, according to WinterGreen Research, a market research firm that tracks the industry. A 2016 TD Ameritrade study reported that two out of 10 families are spending $1,000 per month on elite youth sports.
“I think what’s happened in the last 10 years is that everything’s become professionalized,” said David Jervis, senior director of youth programs for the Red Bulls, a New Jersey-based professional soccer team — owned by the energy drink Red Bull — that operates youth and community programs and targets high potential talent.
“In doing that, it’s raised the cost of participation,” Jervis told Fox News. “Kids from lower-income areas don’t always have the accessibility to the best facilities, to the best coaches and programs across all sports.”
Under programs created by the Red Bulls, boys and girls as young as 10 have the chance to play soccer free of charge. The organization’s Open Soccer Program, for instance, serves underprivileged children whose families cannot afford the costly fees of privately-run clubs and programs.
“Each year we’ll identify 10 to 12 locations where we’ll provide free training, scholarships, and we’ll go into those communities and run soccer camps,” said Jervis. “It’s very rewarding for us and for those kids.”
“Do you always need to spend 3, 4, $5,000 for your child to play at the elite level? I think the answer is ‘no.’” he said. “I think when families spend more on the sport, it can increase the pressure on the kid to perform and get the results.”
In San Diego, Calif., where year-round sports programs are common, Dr. Tommy John, a sports chiropractor, said parents will sacrifice everything — including selling a home or dipping into retirement funds — to afford elite training for their children.
“I’ve heard of families changing cities,” John said. “I’ve heard of polls being taken on Facebook, like, ‘What’s the best baseball cities? Trying to look to where to relocate my 8-year-old.’”

“The financial burden is ridiculous,” he said. “And it absolutely creates an inequality where kids are being run out. They don’t have Little League options. They don’t have a basketball option because it costs six grand to participate.”
A 2016 Families in Sport Lab study found that parents reported spending between 2 to 10 percent of their family’s gross annual household income on athletic activities, per child.
“You think about families maybe that have two or three or even four children participating at the same time and this can get pricey real quick,” said Travis Dorsch, assistant professor at Utah State University and founding director of the Families in Sport Lab.
Dorsch also noted a 2016 poll from the National Alliance for Youth Sports that found that roughly 70 percent of children stop playing organized sports by age 13.
“It’s burnout, plain and simple,” added John, noting that only 2 percent of children will go on to play sports on the collegiate level.

“The answer to all of this starts in the home,” he said. “Parents are spending an exorbitant amount of money for kids to specialize early in one sport.”
“It’s too much money and too much pressure on a kid,” he said. “We need to be reminded that this is not the pros.”

Silicon Valley tech companies have not always been so accepting of their employees engaging in political speech. In 2014, Brendan Eich, the co-founder of Mozilla (Firefox), resigned as the non-profit’s CEO after he was attacked for financially supporting the National Organization for Marriage in 2008, the year the gay-marriage ban in California was overturned.
Earlier this month, an engineer at Pinterest was fired for leaking documents revealing the company’s internal bias and censorship of pro-life users. And let’s not forget the time Google fired engineer James Damore for writing a memo on sex differences.
The good news for Sandberg is that Silicon Valley is a marketplace of ideas and diversity of thought, as long as your ideas are aligned with the leftist mob and their correct thoughts. Thankfully, as we’ve seen with Facebook’s own behavior toward pro-lifers, the goals of Sandberg’s employer correctly align with her political donations.","['pro-life', 'caught', 'worth', 'noting']"

The sports hijab was scheduled to appear on store shelves in the coming weeks with Decathlon director Xavier Rivoire explaining that the item would “make sport accessible to all women in the world,” Il Giornale reports.
The announcement of the sports hijab [pictured, above, worn by an Egyptian sportswoman at the Rio Olympics] provoked a torrent of criticism from various political figures including populist National Rally leader Marine Le Pen who wrote on Twitter, “Money does not allow all submissions and all provocations. Let us remain vigilant: we must not give up any more to these Islamist pressures that are contrary to our civilisation!”
Even a member of French President Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche! (LREM/Republic on the Move) slammed the garment. Minister of Health, Agnes Buzyn said that while it may be legal to sell the sports hijab it “is a vision of a woman that I disagree with.”

Following the criticisms, Xavier Rivoire announced that the shop would not be stocking the item saying the company had decided “in full responsibility, not to sell this product in France.”
The controversy over the product follows that of the Islamic swimwear known as a “burkini” that was initially banned by certain cities and caused an uproar among the French public.
The restrictions were eventually challenged in court with the French supreme court blocking the burkini bans calling them “clearly illegal.” The ruling came after a poll showed that 64 percent of the French approved of the bans and only one in 20 approved of the burkini itself.
France was not the only country to react negatively to the burkini. In Germany, the garment was banned in swimming polls over issues of hygiene with Heinz Kiechle, the Christian Social Union (CSU) mayor of Neutraubling, arguing that the garment was unnecessary.",['slammed']
"The media have tried to convince voters of Trump's failure for many years, but have thus far been unable to do so. Tuesday's special elections show we should hold off on the ""Blue Wave"" and ""Trump can't win"" narratives.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/13/predicted-blue-wave-crashes-in-wisconsin-california-special-elections/,federalist,elections-2020,right,35.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The media have tried to convince voters of Trump's failure for many years, but have thus far been unable to do so. Tuesday's special elections show we should hold off on the ""Blue Wave"" and ""Trump can't win"" narratives.
It was just two days ago that ABC News’ election forecaster FiveThirtyEight suggested “Two Special Elections On Tuesday Could Hint At Another Blue Wave In 2020.”
The case made by Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich was simple: Supposedly Americans strongly prefer Biden and Democrats over Trump and Republicans, and they are particularly upset with Trump and other Republicans’ attempts to reopen the country as the global Coronavirus pandemic rages.
“On Tuesday, we’ll get a taste of whether Democrats’ electoral advantage on paper will hold up in practice, as California and Wisconsin hold special elections for two vacant congressional seats. The main event is in the California 25th Congressional District, a bellwether seat in the north Los Angeles suburbs, where both parties see a chance to add to their ranks in the House. But if Democrats are also competitive in the quickly reddening, rural Wisconsin 7th Congressional District, it could signal another blue wave in the fall,” they argued.
The contest in California’s 25th Congressional District was an open battle for a seat vacated by Katie Hill after the married representative got in trouble with Democratic leadership for intimate relations with some of her staff members. The House had just passed rules forbidding such relationships. She won her seat by nine points in 2018 in a district Hillary Clinton won by seven points. Wisconsin’s blue collar-heavy 7th Congressional District went for Obama by eight points in 2008, but now favors Republicans such as Trump. Trump won the district by some 20 points in 2016, when Republican Sean Duffy won re-election with 62 percent of the vote. Even as a very popular incumbent, Duffy’s support ticked down to 60 percent in 2018. The FiveThirtyEight fellas reminded readers that Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin lost the district by five points in 2018, and Democrat-favored Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice-elect Jill Karofsky lost it by 6 points last month. Suspecting a Republican victory might be eked out, they said to pay special attention to margins.
“Still, pay attention to the final margin, both here and in California. When a party consistently overperforms its usual partisan baseline in special elections, it bodes well for that party in the general election as well. So even a narrow loss by [Democrat Tricia] Zunker, if paired with a comfortable [Democrat Christy] Smith win, would add to the evidence that another Democratic wave is building.”
Well, the results are in and Republicans won both seats. And not by small margins. In Wisconsin, Republican Tom Tiffany beat Zunker by 14.4 points.
In California, with some precincts still reporting, Mike Garcia is currently winning his election by 12 points. According to Dave Wasserman, it’s the first time the GOP has picked up a seat in the state since 1998.
As Alex Berenson, a skeptic of the government-mandated economic shutdown, asked, “But Democrats are the party of lockdowns, and voters love lockdowns, amirite?”
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, similarly tweeted:
How do we jibe these results with the pre-election media spin? There are a few factors to look at. The most obvious one is that members of the Resistance– whether official Democrat Party leaders or the unofficial ones who dominate legacy media — are hoping that Trump’s handling of the global pandemic can be spun into a Trump-specific “Katrina” debacle. They’ve been trying to convince sufficient voters of Trump’s failure for many years, but have thus far been unable to do so.
The media spin against Trump’s handling of the global pandemic is not data-driven or reality-based so much as emotive. The media could be harshly critical of Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose decisions regarding public transportation and nursing homes wreaked tragic results in his state. Instead, they have uniformly praised him. After criticizing Trump for overreacting to the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, by enacting a travel ban, they then said he didn’t do enough. Their latest spin is that he is prioritizing the private sector too much by encouraging a reopening of the economy. Whatever the ever-changing charge, the topline argument remains the same. Trump’s handling is so poor, they say, that many Republicans will suffer in November.
What’s weird about this narrative is that the underlying data do not support it. Trump’s approval during this unrelenting media assault has not gone up, but neither has it gone down. And he remains more popular than Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The promised Blue Wave special election victories turned instead into Republican victories.
Privately, all this narrative spin in the face of facts might relate to what many people know but are worried about admitting publicly. Democrats have a lot going for them headed into November — legacy media support being a huge structural advantage worth countless dollars and voters — but they’re holding a weak hand with their nominee Biden and know that they’re in trouble. Since Trump won, Democratic strategists and other anti-Trump activists have known that the key to preventing a Trump re-election is to peel off enough Republican and independent voters to hand a Democrat a victory.
The Russia collusion hoax didn’t do it, not even with all the resources and support given to the Democrats working in the Robert Mueller Special Counsel probe. The Ukraine impeachment effort was so silly and such a waste of valuable time that the only Republican in the country to fall for it was the emotionally invested NeverTrump senator Sen. Mitt Romney, R-UT. For years, Democratic strategists inside and outside the media have worried that a strong economy would help Trump win re-election. The global pandemic may harm that advantage, they may have reasonably surmised.
The media and others may be hysterical right now, though, because even at the pinnacle of their heightened anti-Trump offensive, polls show him doing fine.
Take a CNN poll that just came out, supposedly showing Biden beating Trump by five points. It is being spun, of course, as excellent news for Biden. But Biden was supposedly trouncing Trump by as much as 11 points in recent months, according to the same CNN polling. Since CNN last polled, it and other media outlets have done nothing but run pieces claiming Trump is a lunatic forcing innocent Americans to ingest bleach. And yet his standing improves? Even worse for Democrats, the CNN poll shows Trump doing well in key battle ground states.
Surely in the midst of this round-the-clock negative coverage of Trump, pollsters should be able to find double digit leads like the ones they put forth last year. In late October, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll had Biden up 9, ABC News/Washington Post had him up by 17, and Fox News claimed he would beat Trump by 12 points. Why isn’t Biden doing better than that in the midst of the media’s uniform criticism of his opponent?
Democrats may be in trouble. Their polls show Biden slipping, he hasn’t even begun to experience the rigors of a legitimate campaign, and Democrats can’t easily replace Biden so long as Bernie Sanders and his supporters continue to exist. And all while even CNN admits that Trump’s 49 percent job approval is “matching the highest it’s ever been” and betting markets are favoring Trump so much that Axios was recently forced to admit it.
None of this is to say that there won’t be a Blue Wave on election day or that Biden won’t win. We’ll have a poll on election day, just like we had polls yesterday in California and Wisconsin. We’ll see what happens. What we do know is that if the media were telling an even remotely accurate story about the political situation thus far, there is no way those two Republicans would have won. So let’s hold off on the “Blue Wave” and “Trump can’t win” narratives.
And as for the talking point that Tuesday’s results would be a sign of what’s to come for Democrats, Republicans may hope so.","['failure', ""can't"", 'win']"
"At least Morrissey, who stepped into his son’s life after an unexpected pregnancy, chose life — unlike Northam, who supports late-term abortion and advocates for killing unwanted children after failed abortions.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/democratic-candidate-sex-minor-plenty-company/#.XQhbRwxVIDU.twitter,federalist,abortion,right,35.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"In addition to blackface, infanticide, and alleged sexual assault, the Democratic Party in Virginia can now add “sex with minors” to the list of questionable hobbies they’ll allow politicians to dabble in.
On Tuesday night, Joe Morrissey, a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, won the Democratic primary for state senate. It was less than four years ago when Morrissey, who was in his fifties at the time, was jailed for having sex with a 17-year-old secretary at his law firm. According to statements from a prosecutor, Morrissey had sex with the girl multiple times in his law office and possessed a nude picture of her that he texted to a friend.
Morrissey was indicted for felony charges of indecent liberties with a minor and possession and distribution of child pornography. He denied the charges, but ended up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in 2015. After serving jail time that year, he continued to deny sexual contact with the teenager, then denied paternity of a baby she delivered months later. Fast-forward a few more months, and Morrissey admitted on the radio that he was the father of the child, and the former secretary is now his wife.
Morrissey won Tuesday’s primary by 14 points, defeating incumbent state Sen. Rosalyn Dance, who was endorsed by Gov. Ralph Northam. Despite campaigning against Northam and the Democratic establishment, both Morrissey and the governor are doing their part in exposing Democrats’ hypocritical pearl-clutching about the sexual behavior of political candidates.
We all know about how media on the left and right talk about Donald Trump’s sexual history. And no one can forget that, for weeks leading up to the Alabama Senate race in 2017, all journalists and the pundit class could talk about was how Republican candidate Roy Moore was a pedophile for dating teenagers. They did forensic analysis on yearbooks from the 1970s, and shamed Alabama voters who supported Moore.
Now we have a modern-day romance with a 40-year age difference and another power dynamic between a teenager and her boss to boot. All without a single question raised or Virginia voter shamed by media think pieces.
Of course, we know exactly how these two cases studies would have turned out if Morrissey and Moore swapped the “D” and the “R” near their names. But what really makes this story rich is that Morrissey is simply another politician in a long list of morally objectionable elected officials who currently hold office in the Commonwealth.
At least Morrissey, who stepped into his son’s life after an unexpected pregnancy, chose life — unlike Northam, who supports late-term abortion and advocates for killing unwanted children after failed abortions. Of course, there is still time for racist photos of Morrissey wearing blackface or a Klu Klux Klan robe to emerge, like they did Northam, or for women from his past to step forward with accusations of sexual assault, like they did for Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax.
But thanks to the new standards set by both Democratic leadership and the media establishment (but I repeat myself), the new state senator candidate will not have to worry for a second about his job security should any additional scandals emerge.","['killing', 'unwanted']"
"The issue of mandatory vaccination is once again an item of debate in media circles given the recent outbreaks in measles, and fueled this week by the continued inability of politicians to discuss vaccination policy without sounding like anti-science fools.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/03/the-insane-vaccine-debate/,federalist,vaccines,right,36.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The issue of mandatory vaccination is once again an item of debate in media circles given the recent outbreaks in measles, and fueled this week by the continued inability of politicians to discuss vaccination policy without sounding like anti-science fools.
It’s surprising that Chris Christie, who was so bold in the use of state plenary power when it came to Ebola, would be the first to put his foot in his mouth on this topic. I understand what he was attempting to say when it came to calling for “balance” in such matters, but the impact of his remarks drew out demands by the media that others respond. Here was Carly Fiorina on the subject, raising the issue of HPV. Rand Paul joined Christie on the subject, agreeing with him for once. Frustrated by the debate, the Kentucky Senator shushes his female interviewer at the three minute mark. I would suggest he not try that tactic against Hillary Clinton.
This would make for the third consecutive presidential cycle in which the candidates have gotten suckered into pretending there is some kind of legitimate debate about American vaccination policies. In 2012, it was Michele Bachmann turning Rick Perry’s Gardasil program into a cause of mental illness. In 2008, Barack Obama implicitly and John McCain explicitly endorsed the idea that autism was on the rise due to vaccination. McCain was actually much worse on the topic, and this piece by Dr. Manhattan (whose son is autistic) contains every bit of information you could ever need on how wrong the senator was.
We’ve had mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren in America since before the Emancipation Proclamation.
The current vaccine debate, unlike those prior ones, is actually motivated by a real problem (the return of diseases presumed previously eradicated) as opposed to conspiratorial musings. There are some basic questions here which are legitimate regarding the protection of the rights of parents, not government, to direct the upbringing of their children. Calls to jail ‘anti-vax’ parents, for instance, strike me as extreme and disturbing. But vaccination is not about protecting the vaccinated so much as it is about protecting others from disease-carriers. Vaccines are properly understood not on the basis of narrow self-interest but as a defense of the human species.
Fundamentally, the protection against life-threatening plague is one of the original reasons government exists. We’ve had mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren in America since before the Emancipation Proclamation. The Supreme Court has upheld that practice as constitutional for over a century, and only the political fringes believe there ought to be a debate about such matters. This is one of the few areas where government necessarily exercises power. Richard Epstein notes the impossibility of turning to the courts for recompense after infection:
The basic soundness of the constitutional recognition of a police power to deal with communicable diseases is beyond dispute. Even in a free state, quarantines are the only reliable remedy to protect the health of the public at large from the spread of disease. It is sheer fantasy to think that individuals made ill could bring private lawsuits for damages against the parties that infected them, or that persons exposed to imminent risk could obtain injunctive relief against the scores of persons who threaten to transmit disease. The transmission of disease involves hidden and complex interconnections between persons that could not be detected in litigation, even assuming that it could be brought in time, which it cannot.
The problem has been the growth of those opting out of vaccination, not due to deeply held religious beliefs or legitimate medical problems or impoverished and irresponsible parents, but because of other concerns. It’s telling that refusing to get your kids vaccinated is the trendy thing among the California elite, even as they decline to embrace other aspects of the Amish lifestyle. Or the Jenny McCarthy lifestyle, for that matter.
The Right To Choose, But Not Without Consequences
I am sympathetic to the idea that some parents believe there are already too many vaccines on the schedule, who have concerns and prefer to delay or space the vaccines out. According to this report, 1 out of every 10 parents already does this. But conceding that parents have the right to delay these shots is not the same as saying they should have the right to prevent such vaccination altogether without consequences.
You shouldn’t be compelled to vaccinate your child, but neither should the rest of us be compelled to pretend like you did.
It’s the failure to deal with those consequences that frustrates me about this debate. If you choose to not vaccinate your children, that is your choice. In the absence of an immediate threat, such as a life-threatening plague or outbreak, the state doesn’t have a compelling reason to administer that vaccination by force or to infringe on your rights. But that doesn’t mean there are no tradeoffs for such a decision. If you choose not to vaccinate, private and public institutions should be able to discriminate on that basis. Disneyland should be able to require proof of vaccination as a condition of entry, and so should public schools. You shouldn’t be compelled to vaccinate your child, but neither should the rest of us be compelled to pretend like you did.
The balance of liberty and autonomy here is important. If you’ll permit me to quote at length, Ronald Bailey wrote intelligently on this in Reason’s 2014 forum on mandatory vaccination, which was excellent (emphasis mine):
Oliver Wendell Holmes articulated a good libertarian principle when he said, ""The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins."" Holmes' observation is particularly salient in the case of whooping cough shots. Infants cannot be vaccinated against whooping cough (pertussis), so their protection against this dangerous disease depends upon the fact that most of the rest of us are immunized. Unfortunately, as immunization refusals have increased in recent years, so have whooping cough infections. The annual number of pertussis cases fell from 200,000 pre-vaccine to a low of 1,010 in 1976. Last year, the number of reported cases rose to 48,277, the highest since 1955. Eighteen infants died of the disease in 2012, up from just four in 1976. The trend is affecting other diseases as well. In 2005, an intentionally unvaccinated 17-year-old Indiana girl brought measles back with her from a visit to Romania, and ended up infecting 34 people. Most of them were also intentionally unvaccinated, but a medical technician who had been vaccinated caught the disease as well, and was hospitalized. Another intentionally unvaccinated 7-year-old boy in San Diego sparked an outbreak of measles in 2008. The kid, who caught the disease in Switzerland, ended up spreading his illness to 11 other children, all of whom were also unvaccinated, putting one infant in the hospital. Forty-eight other children younger than vaccination age had to be quarantined. Some people object to applying Holmes' aphorism by arguing that aggression can only occur when someone intends to hit someone else; microbes just happen. However, being intentionally unvaccinated against highly contagious airborne diseases is, to extend the metaphor, like walking down a street randomly swinging your fists without warning. You may not hit an innocent bystander, but you've substantially increased the chances. Those harmed by the irresponsibility of the unvaccinated are not being accorded the inherent equal dignity and rights every individual possesses. The autonomy of the unvaccinated is trumping the autonomy of those they put at risk.
Try A Carrot, Not Just A Stick
So how should we rebalance this autonomy? One suggestion regarding a path forward on public policy regarding vaccination policy: We speak about these topics mostly in terms of state mandates and sticks, but perhaps that’s not the best way. The Australian experience on vaccines, where they tied access to family tax benefits to immunization, illustrates that carrots can be quite effective.
If the decline in MMR vaccination continues, perhaps the federal government could take the step of making access to the child tax credit contingent upon vaccination. If we’re going to have redistributive social engineering in the tax code, it may as well be for children who aren’t carrying disease around Disneyland.","['anti-science', 'fools']"

“Now, more than ever, Sheryl’s generous support is necessary to help Planned Parenthood fight back against unprecedented attacks on people’s health and rights,” Wen said. “As anti-women’s health politicians try to pass extreme abortion bans across the country, our freedom and rights hang in the balance.”
Silicon Valley tech companies have not always been so accepting of their employees engaging in political speech. In 2014, Brendan Eich, the co-founder of Mozilla (Firefox), resigned as the non-profit’s CEO after he was attacked for financially supporting the National Organization for Marriage in 2008, the year the gay-marriage ban in California was overturned.
Earlier this month, an engineer at Pinterest was fired for leaking documents revealing the company’s internal bias and censorship of pro-life users. And let’s not forget the time Google fired engineer James Damore for writing a memo on sex differences.
The good news for Sandberg is that Silicon Valley is a marketplace of ideas and diversity of thought, as long as your ideas are aligned with the leftist mob and their correct thoughts. Thankfully, as we’ve seen with Facebook’s own behavior toward pro-lifers, the goals of Sandberg’s employer correctly align with her political donations.",[]

Kennedy Jr. a ‘vaccine czar’ without any confirmed details.
For a fleeting moment on Tuesday, the political universe was kumbayaing in mutual disgust at Donald Trump’s meeting with Robert Kennedy Jr. Over the past few decades, RFK Jr.’s famous name has helped him get in the door to talk to important people, and it probably isn’t long before the person who is all jacked up to meet a Kennedy realizes the guy is totally cray-cray. Like most lucky-spermers, RFK Jr. pushes a number of environmental causes and gets really huffy when you ask him about his private jet use.
But it’s RFK Jr’s conspiracy theories about childhood vaccines that raise the ire of pretty much all thinking people, regardless of political affiliation. You can read more about him here and here, but the bottom line is that RFK Jr. is hard-peddling the scary and unscientific connection between vaccines and autism. Here’s just one typical comment from him: “They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.”
So it was with collective alarm that Trump Tower-watchers learned RFK Jr. was meeting with our next president. The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children.
What A Great Opportunity to Raise My Profile
Anti-vaccine activism is not without consequences; parents are refusing to vaccinate their children in higher numbers. For the first time in years, outbreaks of measles and whooping cough are being reported as the needed “herd immunity” is compromised, jeopardizing the health of infants and ill children.
Much of this health hazard lies at the feet of folks like RFK Jr., so the idea that Trump was doing the anti-vax slow-jam with this quack a week before Inauguration Day understandably put Twitterverse over the edge (okay, pretty easy to do). Conservatives and liberals joined virtual hands to denounce the meeting, and RFK Jr. did little to ease fears about his future role in the new administration. “President-elect Trump was very thoughtful,” Kennedy told media after the meeting. “He asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety.”
Ka-boom. Social media and the press went nuts. Major media outlets that lament the influence of fake news on an ignorant (Republican) electorate again sacrificed fact for clicks. USA Today’s headline blared: “Trump asks vaccine skeptic RFK Jr. to lead study on vaccine safety.” Time.com: “Why Donald Trump’s Choice of RFK Jr. as Vaccine Czar is a Terrible Idea.” Twitter moments led with this for a while: “RFK Jr. will chair vaccination safety committee for Trump.”

On Trump's and RFK Jr.'s dangerous, stupid anti-vaxxer bulls*** https://t.co/k1kAvf5Y5z — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) January 10, 2017
The topper—get ready for your shocked face—was from The New York Times. The paper of record’s headline was bad enough—“Trump Asks Critic of Vaccines to Lead Vaccine Safety Panel”—but the article was even worse: “Mr. Trump on Tuesday asked a prominent anti-vaccine crusader to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity, ushering debunked conspiracy theories about the dangers of immunization into the White House.”
So without verification from the Trump transition team, The New York Times posted an ominous article about how anti-vaccine nuts will soon be taking over the West Wing. And they took the word of the one Kennedy people actually run away from, not towards begging to autograph the latest Kennedy coffee table book about Appalachia.
How About a Lil’ Factchecking
Had any of the news outlets waited just a few hours, here’s what the Trump transition team said about the RFK Jr. meeting: “The President-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas. The President-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on Autism, which affects so many families; however no decisions have been made at this time. The President-elect looks forward to continuing the discussion about all aspects of Autism with many groups and individuals.”
Transition releasing a statement saying no decision has been made on this. https://t.co/8Ts8Z6dEqf — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) January 10, 2017
Now, to be fair, there is a perfectly good chance Trump floated the idea to Kennedy and, once the Trump team saw the huge backlash on social media, walked it back. That’s not a new maneuver in presidential politics. Yet the media should have checked it out before reporting it as fact and even going so far as to call RFK Jr. a “vaccine czar” without any confirmed details.
Let me be clear. Trump should not, for any reason, have met with Robert Kennedy Jr. I hope and pray some smart people in the administration will quickly educate Trump about the truth about vaccines and forcefully dissuade him from making any future statements not based in evidence. But the media’s behavior is just as bad. Making up headlines and legitimizing a publicity-seeking loon like RFK Jr. because it feeds your confirmation bias about Trump can do real and lasting damage.","['mutual', 'disgust', 'kumbayaing']"

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was asked by reporters about Thunberg's call for countries to divest from fossil fuels, which he didn't exactly take too seriously.
“Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I’m confused,” Mnuchin jokingly replied. ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us.""
That didn't sit well with one particular CNN anchor.
""Why do these Trumpers think it is OK to go at a kid?"" Cuomo tweeted, scolding the Trump administration.
CNN SETTLES NICK SANDMANN DEFAMATION LAWSUIT IN COVINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL CONTROVERSY
Critics on social media quickly reminded Cuomo about the attacks Sandmann faced by his network, which led to a major settlement earlier this month.
""Didn't your garbage network just settle a nine-figure lawsuit for defaming a Catholic child at a pro-life march?"" The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis asked.
""Chris, your network literally just settled with a Covington High School kid after you smeared him,"" political strategist Caleb Hull told the anchor.
""The name Nick [Sandmann] escape your mind? Or are @CNN employees ordered to pretend you didn't pay him millions for smearing him a year ago for not supporting your left-wing politics?"" radio host Derek Hunter reacted.
Others made the argument that Thunberg is fair game as a public figure, as she was Time's ""Person of the Year.""
""This is -- of course -- why they make children the face of their movements, precisely so you can’t criticize them. If the left wants to have a serious debate about climate change it should put forward individuals prepared to have that debate,"" GOP strategist Chris Barron tweeted.

Cuomo was actually part of the media pile-on against Sandmann last January, shaming the teen for making the ""choice"" of having a ""standoff"" with Native American elder Nathan Phillips, accusing Sandmann of displaying ""disrespect.""
""The kid, Nick Sandmann, he doesn't seem to be afraid, but he did make a choice and that was to make it a standoff. That was not a good choice,"" Cuomo said at the time. ""If that were my son, who happens to go to a great Catholic school, would I like what he did? If I were there, would I have allowed the kids to be in that situation? No and no.

Yet it's merely the tip of the iceberg of war criminals lurking -- and working -- on U.S. turf.,https://www.foxnews.com/us/war-criminals-among-us-inside-the-quiet-effort-to-prosecute-and-deport-violators-disguised-as-refugees,fox-news,immigration,right,36.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"They could be your Uber driver or the security guard at a local airport. The elderly neighbor living next door or the operator of the neighborhood ice cream shop. They came to the United States from all corners of the globe -- Somalia, Rwanda, El Salvador, the Balkans, Germany, Iraq -- claiming to have been persecuted. In reality, they were the persecutors.
For decades, war criminals have lived alongside those they tortured or displaced. Under the guise of being a refugee, they've sought new lives in America. But quiet efforts are underway to expose and punish as many of these hidden offenders as possible -- and ensure none find a lasting haven in the U.S.
“What survivors want is for the truth to come out through the due process,” Dixon Osburn, Executive Director of the Center for Justice & Accountability told Fox News. “When we prove with evidence, that is really empowering for individuals who have suffered.”
SHUNNED CONGOLESE REFUGEE ON RAISING A SON BORN OUT OF RAPE: THE BABY HAD A RIGHT TO LIVE
Just over a month ago, in a civil case championed by San Francisco-based nonprofit CJA, a U.S. jury ruled Somali native Yusuf Abdi Ali shot and tortured at least one other refugee -- who now also lives in the U.S. -- when Ali served as a commander in the national army amid Somalia’s civil war in the late 1980s. Up until the trial in May, Ali drove for Uber and Lyft in Virginia – scoring the jobs even after he was deported from Canada due to his past and despite another suit filed against him that resulted in Ali being placed on administrative leave from a previous position as security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC.
A jury awarded the torture survivor some $500,000 in damages in the CJA case.
It marked the third CJA victory in cases brought against those who committed shocking human rights violations dating back to the early ’90s war in Somalia alone. Yet it's merely the tip of the iceberg of war criminals lurking -- and working -- on U.S. turf.
“In one case years ago, there was a Haitian commander who was living in Miami and appeared on television after winning the lottery. One of his victims saw it and said, ‘wait a minute,’” Osburn recalled, highlighting one of the more than a dozen investigations currently ongoing, ranging from commanders and criminal town mayors to narco-traffickers and other foreign perpetrators. “Never again means never again, and we are doing what we can as members of civil society. We hope each case stands for something bigger.”
Using any means at its disposal -- litigation, transnational justice, policy advocacy -- to bring human rights abusers to justice, CJA has taken on cases involving crimes from areas ranging from El Salvador and Guatemala; to the Balkans, the Horn of Africa, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Chile, Somalia and beyond.
The firm has successfully represented 45 Cambodian Americans in taking on senior Khmer Rouge officials responsible for carrying out mass genocide, starvation and other atrocities in the 1970s under the repressive rule of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. And in the aftermath of the Bosnian War, CJA – on behalf of torture victims – took on Nikola Vuckovic, who had been able to enter the U.S. as a refugee and lead a quiet life in Atlanta before being accused of subjecting his Muslim neighbors to torture at the height of the conflict.
More recently, a case this year was won against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, regarding the president’s direct involvement in the targeted killing of American journalist Marie Colvin amid the vicious civil war and dissident crackdown in 2012.
In April, some ten years since the end of Sri Lanka’s brutal civil war, a former defense chief and U.S. citizen, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who oversaw the defeat of Tamil Tiger rebels, was tracked to a Trader Joe’s parking lot in Los Angeles and served with a civil court complaint accusing him of murder and torture. A spokesman for Gotabaya has consistently denied the accusations and deemed them “politically motivated.” He's reportedly since taken steps to renounce his U.S. citizenship.
Leading the charge on the U.S. government front is the Human Rights Violators War Crimes Center – which was instituted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement more than a decade ago and is operated by Homeland Security Investigations. With an interagency approach and a growing team of about 50 analysts, researchers, attorneys and investigators focused on different geographic regions of the world, the HRVWCC relentlessly investigates individuals residing within the United States, or U.S. persons abroad, suspected of having executed serious human rights violations, including genocide, torture and war crimes.
“When conflicts happen, perpetrators find themselves in the mix of the refugee or displaced persons’ flow. Over time, sometimes we can find out fairly quickly and other times it takes ten or fifteen years for someone to come to us and say ‘hey, this guy did this back in my country,’” HRVWCC Chief Mark Shaffer told Fox News.
Since 2003, ICE has arrested more than 415 individuals for human rights-related violations under an array of criminal and/or immigration statutes. During that same 16-year period, Fox News has learned, ICE obtained deportation orders against and physically removed more than 900 known or suspected human rights violators and has facilitated the departure of 152 others from U.S. soil.
HRVWCC has issued more than 75,000 lookouts for individuals from more than 110 countries and stopped over 300 human rights violators and war crime suspects from entering the country.
As it stands, HSI has more than 170 active investigations into suspected human rights violators and is currently pursuing more than 1600 leads and removal cases involving suspected human rights violators in the U.S.
VACATIONS ON THE EDGE: THE RISE OF THE WAR TOURISM INDUSTRY
Where possible, the HRVWCC teams up with the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue criminal prosecutions pegged to one of four specific areas – genocide, torture, war crimes and recruitment or use of child soldiers – but most often, authorities instead have to turn to the Immigration and Nationality Act and use administrative charges of immigration fraud. This often involves individuals having failed to disclose their nebulous past professions or validating themselves as being of high moral standing.
“So we use what we call the 'Al Capone method,' where we'll use every tool that we have in the toolbox to try and bring some type of justice to these cases,” explained Mona Ragheb, a senior legal advisor with DHS and one of the specialized unit’s few founding members. “We look at each case and try to find a criminal statute that will fly.”
Ragheb also pointed out that the Torture Statute was enacted in 1994 and the legislation against those who recruit child soldiers was enacted in 2008, so, while the unit encounters many examples of those who committed such violations before that date, they are not able to prosecute the offenders criminally on those grounds, meaning they have to turn to the immigration violations.
In one case, a 47-year-old Rwandan man, Jean Leonard Teganya, earlier this month was sentenced to at least eight years in prison for lying about the role he played in the country’s 1994 genocide in order to be granted asylum in the United States.
Meanwhile, Ilija Josipovic – who in 2003 settled as a refugee with his family in Ohio having denied any prior military service – was exposed by investigators 12 years later as having been a high-ranking Bosnian Serb officer and accused of war crimes. ICE agents returned him to Bosnia in 2017.
That same year, a 73-year-old Delaware man, Mohammed Jabateh, was convicted of concealing his prior life as a Liberian war criminal during the conflict in the 1990s. And in 2014, a Lebanese-born man Mahmoud Bazzi – who came to the U.S. on someone else’s passport in 1993 and went on to get a valid green card and set up an ice-cream business in Michigan – was accused by two former members of the Irish Defense Forces of kidnapping and torturing them during a UN mission in 1980. He was then convicted and deported.
Even Nazi war criminals in the U.S. have come under the glare in recent decades.
Characterized as the last Nazi war criminal in America, Jakiw Palij – who served as a forced labor camp guard and trained other Nazi perpetrators – came to the U.S. four years after WWll ended as “a farmer” and was later granted citizenship. When the longtime New Yorker’s murky past was brought to the surface decades later, Palij was finally deprived of his citizenship in 2003. But it wasn’t until last year, at the urging of President Trump, that the then 95-year-old was carried out of his Queens home by ICE agents on a stretcher and expelled to Germany.
Before that case, research led by HRVWCC paved the way for concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk to have his U.S. citizenship revoked in 2009 before he was sent to Munich to stand trial. Similarly, a naturalized American citizen in Massachusetts, Aleksandras Lileikis – who was later proven by unit investigators to have been a top Nazi collaborator – was stripped of his citizenship more than a decade earlier and returned to Lithuania.
While the overwhelming majority of those exposed are male, female war criminals are among the mix, too.
One refugee known as Sammy Yetisen who came to the U.S. in the 1990s built a new existence in Oregon, had a child and became a naturalized citizen in 2002. But in 2012, Yetisen was stripped of her citizenship and extradited after it was discovered that she – using the alias Rasema Handanovic aka Zolja – had targeted Bosnian Croat citizens by firing squad as part of an elite special-forces unit with the Supreme Command staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was later revealed she fled her unit in 1995 and sought refuge in the U.S. under the guise she was a Muslim and thus had no safe place to turn to in Bosnia.
HRVWCC’s team also works to ensure human rights violators are prohibited from future entry, what they deem a “preventative mission.”
“It’s a team of intelligence research specialists who specialize in a particular region of the world, or on a specific conflict,” Shaffer said. “Usually the information we gather is enough to prevent (an involved individual) from entering the United States.”

Nonetheless, for some victims, justice is held up by a fear of coming forward. One California-based Iraqi, who fled to the U.S. amid the U.S.-led operation in 2003 after being threatened by Baghdad militias because of his work for American contractors, told Fox News the very person who threatened his family and firebombed a relative’s house was believed to be in Texas, according to the man's social media. Yet the victim – still afraid for his family and insisting he wants nothing more than a drama-free, quiet life – said he just wants the matter to go away.
“If there is no investigation and no prosecution, often there is no justice for these victims – ever,” Ragheb stressed. “We always say never forget and never again, and we always hope our work here can persuade countries who might have amnesty to also live like that.”

President of Belarus refuses to cancel sports and scoffs at ‘Psychosis’ of coronavirus measures.,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/03/31/president-of-belarus-refuses-to-cancel-sports-scoffs-at-psychosis-of-coronavirus-measures/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,37.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, will not order sports in his country to shut down over the coronavirus. In fact, on Saturday, he scoffed at the “psychosis,” leading to such extreme measures.
Lukashenko, who is a big hockey fan as well as a player, was asked at a recent amateur hockey game if he thinks the country should shut down sports like so many other countries have already done. But the the 65-year-old leader dismissed the worries, according to USA Today.
“It is better to die on your feet, than live on your knees! …I don’t understand. There is no virus here. This (arena) is a refrigerator, it is the best thing for your health. Sport, especially on ice, is better than any antiviral medication, it is the real thing,” Lukashenko told television station All-National TV.
The nation’s long-time leader added that sport “is the best anti-virus remedy.”
Lukashenko has pointedly refused to adhere to any proclamations by the World Health Organization and refused to close any part of his government, business, or private sectors.
The president, who first assumed the office back in 1994 after the country’s break with the old USSR, took a swipe at the leaders of other nations who he sees as having been cowed by the virus. Belarusians, Lukashenko said, “do not suffer the same psychosis as those in Western Europe,” and in his country, “no one is talking about the virus. In the villages, the tractor will heal everyone. The fields heal everyone.”
It is so blatant that former pro soccer player Alexander Hleb called his native Belarus the “only place in Europe you can play (soccer).”
“In Belarus, it’s like no one cares (about coronavirus),” Hleb told Fox Sports Australia. “All the world now watches the Belarusian league. Everybody should go to their television and see us. … It’s very difficult to explain our country. All leagues (in other countries) have closed, but we don’t seem to think it’s a problem. Why? I don’t know. Everybody’s been training as normal, getting ready for the new season. They just don’t care.”
Lukashenko also noted that he “really liked” President Donald Trump’s recent statements about getting the U.S.A. back to work.
“There were many people urging me to close borders, enterprises, and begin a nationwide quarantine. Back then, I made a principled decision: we will implement a quarantine only when it is really needed,” Lukashenko said.

Do we have the will to unite once more?
Are we at war? Did we pass that invisible line beyond which the country cannot hold? After everything the Democrats and the media have put us through since the election of Donald Trump, is it even possible to imagine peaceful reconciliation and common national purpose?
For a majority of Americans, the answers to those three questions are as obvious as they are dispiriting. That so many believe the country has fallen, is falling, or will be falling soon is a terrifying reality. An America that destroys itself will be like nothing the world has seen. If our institutions fall, if indiscriminate violence becomes the norm, if the economy crashes, we will condemn ourselves to not years, but decades of poverty and chaos.
For far too many on the left, chaos is the point. Destruction is the goal. They prefer the unknown madness that lies ahead to whatever is still managing to (barely) hold us together in the present.
Constitutional republicans often look at what the left unleashes and see no point in pretending that we are a nation at peace. Some would rather we finally end this lingering “cold civil war” and get down to the dirty business of fighting for America’s future.
Why doesn’t this prospect terrify every politician in the American government? Why do they work so hard to exacerbate the conflict when their offices and positions of power will be the first casualties of any actual war that tears this country apart? Are they all so blind to believe that they can lead a country to victory by destroying it?
How do we avoid a war that will end America when mayors, governors, congressmen, judges, journalists, and bureaucrats are all actively conspiring to drag us into the blaze?
On May 25, a black man died in police custody. We saw images of a police officer’s knee on the back of this man’s neck. Immediately, Americans—almost to a person—said, “This is wrong.”
There is no great divide on the moral question of what happened to George Floyd. There is no disagreement between the defenders of law and order and the defenders of civil liberty. In this case, law and order and civil liberty require the same response. All Americans should have been able to unite in condemning this injustice.
What happened instead? Radical leftists transformed a moment of national agreement into one of divisive conflict.
Americans united in their sense of what is just have no reason to destroy each other. Unity and agreement lead to peace. Uncorralled passion and grievance, however, can turn violence into a political opportunity.
The looting and riots and fires in blue cities across the country today reaffirm that it is not “justice” but “war” that today’s radicals have in mind. From a moment that brought all Americans together in their sense of right and wrong, politicians and groups bent on destabilizing the nation chose division…and got their way.
After nights of murder and loss, President Trump walked to a firebombed church with a Bible in hand. There was a moment to de-escalate. There was an opportunity to choose calm. There was a chance for reconciliation. Instead, CNN accused the president of hurting “peaceful protesters” for a photo op. Some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country call him a fascist, a bigot, and a murderer.
When every act of peace is treated like war, and every act of war is treated like justice, how do Democrats expect to preserve a future America for them to lead?
If Democrats believe that creation can only come from wanton destruction, how can we ever trust them to choose peace when they have an opportunity to destroy?
Breaking store windows, setting buildings on fire, vandalizing monuments to American heroes, leaving graffiti threats on synagogue walls, attacking Christian churches and tombstones, terrorizing the living, and giving no peace to the dead— these are the great accomplishments of Antifa and those they egg on. They have given America her own “Kristallnacht” and still fail to see the sad irony. Or maybe they understand it completely. Maybe it’s only sad to those with their eyes and ears open because the press so easily missed the joke.
Most Americans had no idea that leftists thought setting the nation on fire was akin to the Boston Tea Party. Though most Americans who’ve been paying attention never really understood how Democrats could so easily join hands with Iran’s Ayatollah, the Chinese Communist Party, dangerous drug cartels on our southern border, and international corporations that have strengthened China at the expense of the American worker. How can Democrats be friends with so many of our enemies and pretend—with a straight face—that they are still our friends as well?
If America is to survive, something new must take hold right now. The current political parties and officeholders and corporate-owned media are not up to the task.
Politicians who cheer on destruction should be behind bars, not before microphones.
Those who directly or indirectly fund mayhem and destruction should be in courtrooms defending their actions, not hiding on palatial estates while applauding the carnage.
Social media giants who act as authoritarian state censors should not be afforded extra-constitutional protections while they work to undermine the rights of everyone else.
If we will unite together once more, America may well recover. If we do not, it’s future survival could be in danger. We must stand up to the insurrectionists all around us—and we must do so today, lest it becomes that much harder to do so tomorrow.
Tolerance for criminality and political sabotage has led us to the edge of a dangerous cliff. We will either dig our heels into the ground and push back or we risk falling into the murky depths below.","['chaos', 'unknown', 'madness', 'Destruction']"
"Netflix's statements related to leaving Georgia if fetal heartbeat law goes into effect is the company’s way of firing a warning shot to Georgia and similar states: Conform to our Hollywood ideals and values, or we won’t give you our business.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/03/netflix-disney-dont-get-decide-georgias-abortion-laws/#disqus_thread,federalist,abortion,right,37.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Netflix is saying it will “rethink” its investments in Georgia because of the fetal heartbeat bill that was signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp. The law, formerly House Bill 481, is formally known as the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act.” It prohibits abortions in the state after a heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. The law allows exceptions in the case of rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is in danger.
For now, Netflix will continue filming “Ozark” and other shows in Georgia. But the media giant says it very well might leave if the law goes into effect on January 1, 2020.
Of course, the odds are quite high that a lower court will block the law and thus give the Supreme Court the opportunity to consider its constitutionality and that of similar laws around the nation. Netflix likely knows this, and I can only conclude that its statements related to the Georgia fetal heartbeat law is the company’s way of firing a warning shot to Georgia and similar states: Conform to our Hollywood ideals and values, or we won’t give you our business.
This is very disappointing, because the Georgia fetal heartbeat law is the very essence of democracy and of our republic. The Georgia bill passed by a vote of 92-78 in its lower house and by a vote of 34-19 in its upper house before being signed into law by Kemp. The people of Georgia, through their democratically elected officials, weighed in on the very important issue of when life begins. They decided to protect what they define as vulnerable human beings.
But now, the streaming company that employed Kevin Spacey for years as he harassed cast and crew on the set of “House of Cards,” decides threats of their abandonment should dictate the laws of Georgia (and presumably other states with like-minded legislators and constituents).
Disney is now making similar threats should the law go into effect as intended on January 1. But Disney and Netflix should not serve as the pilots of our moral compass in this country. Netflix, for one, has been accused of not paying its fair share of taxes, and its juggernaut status in entertainment could mean that its size and deep pockets could become influential in policy matters down the road. Perhaps its challenge to the Georgia bill is its way of testing the waters.
Consumers should fight back and let Netflix know that it can’t transplant its values to Georgia or any other state exercising its system of democracy.
It’s worth pointing out that the drama over Netflix and the new abortion law is a consequence of different states offering tax incentives to entertainment production crews. As California became increasingly expensive, states passed bills that were too good for production crews to pass up.
The Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act provides a 20 percent tax credit for companies that spend $500,000 or more on production and post-production in Georgia either in a single production or on multiple projects. The state grants an additional 10 percent tax credit if the finished project includes a promotional logo provided by the state.

Or, how do we approach the media’s fondness for focusing on the unscientific views of some conservatives but ignoring the irrational—and oftentimes, more consequential—beliefs of their fellow liberals?",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/04/five-ways-liberals-ignore-science/,federalist,vaccines,right,37.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times claims that this insane “presidential vaccine controversy” we’re all taking about raises important questions about “how to approach matters that have been settled among scientists but are not widely accepted by conservatives.”
Well, here’s another question: How do we deal with the false perception that liberals are more inclined to trust science than conservatives? Or, how do we approach the media’s fondness for focusing on the unscientific views of some conservatives but ignoring the irrational—and oftentimes, more consequential—beliefs of their fellow liberals?
It’s no big deal for us to ask Republican evolution skeptics to raise their hands or force a bogus Senate vote to try and shame Republicans, yet no reporter would ever think to ask a pro-choice politician if they believe life begins at conception. Sometimes denialism matters and sometimes it doesn’t.
Though outing a GOP candidate as a skeptic of science may confirm the secular liberal’s own sense of intellectual superiority, it usually has nothing to do with policy. Then again, if you walk around believing that pesticides are killing your children or that fracking will ignite your drinking water or if you hyperventilate about the threat of the ocean consuming your city, you have a viewpoint that not only conflicts with science but undermines progress. So how do we approach matters that have been settled among scientists but are not widely accepted by liberals?
Vaccines
There is little proof that conservatives are any less inclined to vaccinate their children than anyone else. If we’re interested in politicizing the controversy, though, there is a good case to be made for the opposite.
For starters, polls show that millennials (most of which lean liberal) are far more skeptical about vaccines than older Americans. You’ll notice that laws with easier loophole exemptions from vaccination are most often found in blue states, where we also find the most outbreaks. You might also notice that leading anti-vaxers like RFK Jr. are writing in the mainstream Rolling Stone, not National Review. As New York Times itself already reported, half of the children attending schools in Marin County go unvaccinated by their enlightened parents. And here’s Jason Millman at the Washington Post digging deeper:
The communities where anti-vaxxers cluster are also among the most liberal. Marin County, San Francsico County and Alameda County all voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008. In Marin, 78 percent of the vote went to Obama. In San Francisco, it was 84 percent. And in Alameda, it was 79 percent. That’s all higher than what Obama got in his own home county of Cook County, Illinois. Here, too, Sacramento is an exception. Only 58 percent of the county went for Obama in 2008.
Anecdotally speaking, when I followed this issue in Colorado years back, it always seemed to me that the most vociferous anti-vax parents were from the organic hotbed of Boulder rather than God-fearing Colorado Springs—although neither place was innocent. In an interview with Science magazine, Seth Mnookin, author of “The Panic Virus: A True Story of Medicine, Science, and Fear,” a book exploring the scare over the vaccine-autism link, was asked whether the perception that “vaccine refusal is especially common among affluent, well-educated, politically liberal parents” was true. He answered:
It’s dangerous to make broad generalizations about a group, but anecdotally and from the overall data that’s been collected it seems to be people who are very actively involved in every possible decision regarding their children’s lives.
None of this is particularly surprising. Modern environmentalism perpetuates myths about the inorganic world and the evils of Big Pharma. It’s adherents are just as likely to be in conflict with settled science as anyone else.
Global Warming Alarmism
The perception that one political group is less science-savvy than another is predominately driven by the unwillingness of many conservatives to accept global-warming alarmism and the policies purportedly meant to mitigate it. But when it comes to climate change, volumes could be written about the ill-conceived, unscientific, over-the-top predictions made by activists and politicians.
We could start with our own Malthusian Science Czar, who once predicted that climate change would cause the deaths of a billion people by 2020 and that sea levels would rise by 13 feet. In 2009, James Hansen, one of nation’s most respected climate scientists, told President Obama that we have “only four years left to save the earth.” In 1988, he predicted parts of Manhattan would be underwater by 2008. If you don’t like high-speed rail, Jerry Brown will let you know that LAX Airport is going to be underwater. And so on and on and on. What we most often hear from science-loving environmentalists is nothing more than speculation.
If there weren’t some kind of left-wing ideological endgame propelling this tendentious guesswork and scaremongering about a relatively small changes in earth’s climate, it would be laughed out of any serious debate. Yet, in the contemporary world, there is no consequence for being a professional Chicken Little. In fact, the media puts you on Team Science.
Genetically Modified Foods
Undermining the future of genetically modified crops—a process, that in one form or another, humans have been engaged in for around 10,000 years —probably hurts society (the poor, in particular) more than any global warming denial ever could. Across the world, almost every respected scientific organization that’s taken a look at independent studies has found that GMOs are just as safe as any other food. There is no discernable health difference between conventional or organic food. There is a difference, though, in productivity, in environment impact and the in ability of the world’s poor to enjoy healthier, high-caloric diets for a lot less money.
Yet, while Republicans are evenly divided on whether genetically modified foods are unsafe, Democrats believe so by a 26-point margin. Liberals across the United States—New York, California, Oregon, and Massachusetts recently—have been pushing for labeling foods to create the perception that something is wrong with it. Science disagrees. Reporters at some of the country’s biggest newspapers might wonder how Democrats will approach this matter that has been settled among scientists.
Fracking
Hydraulic fracturing is as safe as any other means of extracting fossil fuels. It creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. It provides cheaper energy for millions of Americans. It has less of an environmental impact than other processes. It means less dependency on foreign oil. It helped the economy work its way out of a recession. So 62 percent of Republicans support science and 59 percent of Democrats oppose it. Even though numerous scientific studies— one funded by the National Science Foundation that debunked the purported link between groundwater pollution and fracking—have assured us that there’s nothing to fear.
Astrology/Fortune Telling/Space Invaders/Everything Else
We don’t need to get into the catalogue of preposterous studies that have been uncritically thrown around by Nanny State liberals over the past few decades—including debunked scaremongering about obesity and second-hand smoke. The same goes for all brands of localism, organic farming, irrational fears about DDT and trade—all positions that undermine progress. Let’s chalk this up to an innate impulse most people have to bolster their worldview. Believe whatever makes you feel good.
Then again, what are we to make of people who mock religion as imaginary but believe a sun sign should determine whom you date or are concerned that they will be wisked away in a flying saucer?
According to a Huff Post/YouGov poll, 48 percent of adults in the United States believe that alien spacecrafts are observing our planet right now. Among those who do believe extraterrestrials are hanging around, 69 percent are Democrats, a far higher number than Republicans. Democrats were also significantly more likely than Republicans to believe in fortune telling, and about twice as likely to believe in the astrology. I won’t even get into 9/11 truthers.
For many conservatives, resolving issues of faith and science can be tricky. What excuse do Democrats have? Maybe someone at the New York Times can find out.","['irrational', 'liberals', 'false', 'perception', 'consequential']"
"Tokyo Games is even more of a dream fulfilled for the small baseball community in Israel, comprised mostly of American immigrants, and which has languished for decades in the country’s sporting wilderness.",https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/01/15/israels-unlikely-olympic-baseball-team-dreams-big-for-japan/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,sport,right,37.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — As a baseball-crazed kid growing up in Miami, Danny Valencia dreamed of playing in the Major Leagues. The thought of heading to the Olympics, for a foreign country no less, never crossed his mind.
But after nine years and nearly 100 homers in the big leagues, that’s the next surreal step for the 35-year-old Valencia, who recently became an Israeli citizen thanks to his Jewishness and is now the star player in Team Israel’s improbable run to the Tokyo Games. Baseball is returning to the Olympics after being dropped for 2012 and 2016 and Israel is one of six teams vying for the three medals.
“It’s pretty cool to be playing in the Olympics,” he told The Associated Press at a team event in Tel Aviv. “For it to come about the way it did, especially for my mother who is a practicing Jew and very pro-Israel, it just meant a lot to her. So, to do this, especially at the end of my career, it is like the icing on the cake. ”
It’s even more of a dream fulfilled for the small baseball community in Israel, comprised mostly of American immigrants, and which has languished for decades in the country’s sporting wilderness. Israel has zero tradition of the American pastime, which is largely derided by locals as an arcane and boring sport.
In Israel, soccer and basketball reign supreme while baseball, long popular among American Jews, has failed to catch on with the rough-and-tumble native-born Israelis who have taken more of a liking to the strategy and hard hitting of American football.
Only about 1,000 kids play baseball in Israel and there is just one regulation baseball field in the country. In 2007, a group of American supporters launched the Israel Baseball League, a semi-professional league comprised almost entirely of foreign players that generated little interest and folded after just one season.
But thanks to a creative outreach campaign to Jewish-American pros, Israel’s national team has surged to unthinkable heights.
It started when Israel fielded a qualifying team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic that was skippered by future Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus and included former all-star Shawn Green. In 2017, Israel made the showcase tournament, upsetting South Korea and Taiwan en route to a surprising 6th-place finish.
But even that paled in comparison to the sensation of knocking off the top three European teams before routing South Africa 11-1 in September to earn the Europe/Africa Olympic berth and becoming the first team to qualify after host Japan. Mexico and South Korea, which won the Olympic gold in 2008, have since also qualified with the final two openings to be decided in the coming months.
It’s an achievement that Gili Lustig, the executive director of the Israel Olympic Committee, said was nothing short of “unbelievable.” Extolling praise this week in Hebrew upon the team — nearly none of whose members understood the language — he expressed hope that their Olympic odyssey would finally give the sport its long-awaited boost in Israel.
“What’s important is to leverage your participation to grow baseball in Israel,” he said. “I have no doubt you will represent us well.”
Lustig noted that the 24-member group will represent the first time Israel is sending a team sport to the Olympics since 1976, when it sent a soccer team, and will make the Israeli delegation to Tokyo the country’s largest ever.
Baseball is one of five sports that were added to the 2020 Summer Olympics. It won’t be back in Paris in 2024 but seems likely to return once again for Los Angeles 2028.
Unlike the World Baseball Classic, whose “heritage rule” allowed countries to field players who were merely eligible for citizenship, the Olympics requires its participants to be full-fledged citizens of the countries they represent. Israel grants citizenship to anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent and in recent months the players have been going through the process, providing marriage certificates, letters from rabbis and other proof of their Judaism. Five of the players have Major League experience and others who find themselves outside opening day rosters may join later before the games kick off in July.
Among the former major leaguers on the team are Jon Moscot, Ty Kelly and Josh Zeid.
Once in Israel, they’ve faced an even greater challenge in drawing interest among a skeptical audience that couldn’t tell the difference between a strikeout and a stolen base. Even Israeli President Reuven Rivlin offered his greetings with a caveat while meeting the team during their current week-long promotional visit to the Holy Land.
“It’s not a secret that I prefer soccer, but you can’t ignore your exciting achievement,” he told them at his Jerusalem residence.
Team Israel head coach Eric Holtz, himself an American Jew who plans to apply for citizenship, said he is aiming to double the number of local players in Israel within two years of the Olympics. He said his primary mission was to “instill our love and passion to the five and six-year-old kids throughout this country and show them what a great game this is.”
As for the Olympic Games themselves, he noted that Israel would be an underdog, as usual, but still had a theoretical 50% chance of winning a medal.
“Nobody gave us a shot … and we shocked the world,” Holtz said of the qualifying process. “It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity and we as a team couldn’t be prouder to represent Israel.”

Biel joined prominent anti-vax campaigner Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the founder of Children’s Health Defense, in Sacramento for meetings with several members of the California State Assembly and Senate on what he described as a “busy” and “productive” day.
https://www.instagram.com/p/Byl1y56lLOO/?utm_source=ig_embed
The pair were specifically lobbying against Senate Bill 276, which aims to crack down on doctors who provide what sponsoring senator Richard Pan describes as “fake” medical exemptions.
Biel is merely the latest Hollywood celebrity to lend their support to the controversial anti-vaccine movement, which has been outright rejected and criticized by the scientific community.
Hollywood figures including actors Robert De Niro, Jim Carrey, and Jenny McCarthy have all backed anti-vax campaigns, which often centers around fears that they are harmful and cause other health issues.
Last December, a global surge in cases of measles was blamed on growing support for the anti-vax movement, with an official from the World Health Organization warning that we “risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating, but entirely preventable disease.”
Biel posted on Instagram Thursday morning that she supports children getting vaccinated and she also supports families having the “right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”
Biel wrote that she argued against the bill because her friends have a child with a medical condition warranting an exemption and the bill would “greatly affect their family’s ability to care for their child.”

"Last week, Ankara broke the 2015 agreement with Brussels in which it would stop the illegal flow of migrants through Turkey in exchange for money and continuing EU accession talks, and opened the gates which resulted in thousands of migrants amassing on the near-east country’s land border with Greece.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/03/05/hungary-vows-it-will-protect-europe-illegal-mass-migration-again/,breitbart,immigration,right,38.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has said that his country will defend Europe against a wave of illegal mass migration as it had done in 2015 during the first migrant crisis.
Speaking to the media at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Orbán said while his country and the EU should “give all the help we can” to Greece to stop the migrant flows, “It won’t be enough just to defend the Greek-Turkish border.”
“As a last resort, as in 2015, there are the Hungarians,” he said during the summit with leaders of the three other central European Visegrád countries, adding: “Even if Greece’s attempt is successful, the EU border must be defended… which Hungary will do.”
Last week, Ankara broke the 2015 agreement with Brussels in which it would stop the illegal flow of migrants through Turkey in exchange for money and continuing EU accession talks, and opened the gates which resulted in thousands of migrants amassing on the near-east country’s land border with Greece. The migrants are reportedly from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
Turkey’s Islamist president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared on Monday that “the doors are now open”, telling the EU “to take your share of the burden”. There are some 3.6 million migrants living in Turkey.
Over the weekend, unmarked white coaches were seen driving migrants from Istanbul to the border with Greece, free of charge. People smugglers in the border region have said that they have been given free rein by Erdoğan’s government, with one telling media that it was his patriotic duty to get migrants out of Turkey so that his country’s economy can improve.
Erdogan Tells Europe: Expect ‘Millions’ of Migrants via Turkey https://t.co/EDBTZiJX5w — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2020
Greece was the main entry point into Europe for Middle Eastern migrants and asylum seekers during the 2015 migrant crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands march along what became known as the Balkan route, through Hungary, and onwards to wealthy, northern-European countries like Germany and Sweden that have generous welfare packages.
Hungary vowed to stop the flows into Europe by building a border fence, increasing border guard patrols, and enacting zero-tolerance on illegal migrants. A report from September 2017 revealed that the central European nation’s common sense approach to stopping mass migration worked, slashing illegal immigration by 99 per cent, the numbers falling from 391,000 in 2015, to just 1,184 in 2017.
A leaked report from Frontex, the EU’s border agency, warned of “mass migration flows” to Greece that will be “difficult to stop” this time around. European leaders like Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have called Turkey’s action an attack on Greece and Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited the border with Turkey and said that the bloc would show “solidarity” with Greece.
The word “solidarity” in the EU has become tainted for Conservatives and populists, owing to it evoking the response of Brussels and Berlin to the 2015 crisis. After German Chancellor Angela Merkel flung open the doors of Europe to unlimited migrants, she then demanded other countries — who had not been party to the decision to suspend asylum rules in the first place — show their ‘European solidarity’ and take their ‘fair share’ of migrants. If member states did not, the EU threatened punishment. The ultimatum caused a rift in the EU between Western and Eastern Europe, with countries like Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting asylum seekers.
While Brussels and the bloc’s liberal-progressive members have pushed for an EU-wide asylum policy — which seeks to dole out arrivals to member states and fails to increase security — Hungary has said the superstate should instead take her lead and fortify Europe’s external borders as well as focusing on supporting refugees in their own countries and regions.
One smuggler said it was his patriotic duty to help get the migrants over the border into Europe, as their presence was slowing down the Turkish economy… https://t.co/YKc6f3gcrD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2020
–Hungary suspends admission of illegals to transit area due to threat of coronavirus —
On top of the new migrant crisis, Europe is also grappling with the threat of the China-origin coronavirus. Hungary has changed its already robust asylum rules in light of the spreading virus, with the country’s national security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi announcing on Sunday that because of the related risks of uncontrolled movements of people and infection, “Hungary has indefinitely suspended access to border transit areas for asylum seekers”.
“We observe a certain link between coronavirus and illegal migrants,” Mr Bakondi said in comments reported by euronews.
The national security adviser continued that there is particular concern over illegals arriving from, or who have travelled, through Iran, a virus epicentre.
In the UK, the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 85. The situation is worse in Italy, where some 2,260 people have contracted coronavirus and there have been 80 deaths. On Wednesday, the Italian government announced that schools will be closed in an attempt to halt the spread of the deadly virus.","['illegal', 'migrants', 'amassing']"
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has taken Congress by storm, quickly becoming the de facto leader of the left-wing bloc of freshman Democrats seeking to overhaul the status quo with far-left ideas like the Green New Deal.",,fox-news,environment,right,38.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has taken Congress by storm, quickly becoming the de facto leader of the left-wing bloc of freshman Democrats seeking to overhaul the status quo with far-left ideas like the Green New Deal.
But behind the most influential democratic socialist in the country (sorry, Bernie) is an aide whose story is very different from the bartender background of Bronx-born Ocasio-Cortez.
Meet Saikat Chakrabarti. At 33, he came to Washington a wealthy tech entrepreneur, and now serves as the congresswoman’s chief of staff – or as he quips in his Twitter bio, “CoS to @AOC.”
OCASIO-CORTEZ DENIES DARK-MONEY ALLEGATIONS IN FEC COMPLAINT: 'THERE IS NO VIOLATION'
The aide for months flew under the radar, but hit the headlines amid fresh accusations of possible campaign finance violations in a conservative watchdog group's FEC complaint. Far from an in-the-trenches organizer by trade, Chakrabarti was a Harvard-educated computer engineer and went on to make his riches in a number of startups in Silicon Valley, before eventually turning his attention to promoting the new wave of democratic socialists.
Chakrabarti spent eight years in Silicon Valley, where he co-founded the web design tool Mockingbird -- before working as a ""founding engineer"" at a payment processor called Stripe, according to his LinkedIn page. Politico reports that work came after a “brief stint on Wall Street.”
From there, he shifted into the world of left-wing activism, where he worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., 2016 presidential bid, before co-founding Brand New Congress -- an organization looking to launch left-wing candidates into Congress.
That in turn led to his co-founding of Justice Democrats -- the organization that seeks ""to usher in a new generation of diverse working class leaders into the Democratic Party"" and that propelled Ocasio-Cortez to her unlikely primary victory over then-Rep. Joe Crowley. During her longshot bid, Chakrabarti served as her campaign manager.
Ocasio-Cortez has stuck with Justice Democrats since her election in November and recently appeared in a video promoting Justice Democrats’ push to oust centrist Democrats, in which she also appears alongside Chakrabarti -- whom she appointed as her No. 2 before heading to Washington, D.C.
His journey from California to D.C. has apparently been a successful one.
The New York Post describes Chakrabarti as a “tech millionaire” with homes in New York’s uber-trendy West Village (although it appears that is a rental), and in Maryland. According to property records, Chakrabarti purchased a home last spring in Gaithersburg, Md., for $1.6 million.
The Washington Examiner reported that since Ocasio-Cortez has imposed a staff salary cap of $80,000 a year, it means that Chakrabarti and others are under the $126,000 salary level that would require them to submit public financial disclosure forms for outside income and other financial information.
Finances, though, are turning out to be problematic for Ocasio-Cortez and Chakrabarti. The latest Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint accuses the pair of violating campaign finance law by funneling nearly $1 million in contributions from political action committees Chakrabarti established to private companies he also controlled. Although large financial transfers from PACs to LLCs are not necessarily improper, the complaint argues that the goal of the ""extensive"" scheme was seemingly to illegally dodge detailed legal reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which are designed to track campaign expenditures.
Ocasio-Cortez has said there is no campaign finance violation.
“There is no violation,” Ocasio-Cortez exclusively told Fox News after landing Tuesday at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Asked if the complaint shows she was connected to ""dark money"" during the campaign, Ocasio-Cortez replied, “No, no.”
Chakrabarti did not return requests for comment from Fox News, but he defended the set-up on Twitter, saying, ""We were doing something totally new, which meant a new setup. So, we were transparent about it from the start.""
The tech mogul turned activist, meanwhile, was featured in a glowing profile in Politico Playbook’s 2019 Power List -- in which he is said to have “his sights set squarely on the halls of power.”
“He has big policy dreams, like a ‘Green New Deal,’ which would tackle everything from mitigating climate change to transforming the American economy, and criminal justice reform. He wants to lay the groundwork now to make them realities,” the article says.
The Green New Deal -- a pet project of left-wing activist groups -- has shot to the front of political conversation. In a sign of Ocasio-Cortez’s (and Chakrabarti’s) influence, within a month of her entering Congress, almost all the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls signed onto a non-binding resolution endorsing the enormous overhaul of the economy and energy use in America.
Ocasio-Cortez's pushback against Amazon building a campus in New York was also successful, with Amazon pulling out of the deal last month. Despite anger from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Ocasio-Cortez has not backed down, and on Tuesday Chakrabarti went on Bloomberg TV to defend her stance.
“What she was vocal about was the process by which it happened, the deal,” he said. “Amazon is the company that chose to step away from the negotiating table.”

Rapinoe called on soccer stars Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to begin speaking out on racism, sexism, and equal pay, ESPN reported.
On the heels of winning the female Ballon d’Or award on Monday, Rapinoe demanded that male soccer stars speak up on her political causes.
“I want to shout: ‘Cristiano, Lionel, Zlatan, help me!'” Rapinoe exclaimed. “These big stars do not engage in anything when there are so many problems in men’s football.”
Rapinoe went on to accuse the male players of being too cowardly to speak out.
“Do they fear losing everything? They believe that, but it is not true,” Rapinoe said, scolding the male players. “Who will erase Messi or Ronaldo from world football history for a statement against racism or sexism?”
The Women’s World Cup winner went on to insist that her extreme, left-wing activism is integral in her success in sports.
“This Ballon d’Or rewards both,” her sport and her activism, she said. “On the one hand, I am a good player. On the other, my activity away from the pitch brings me support as people understand I am acting to find solutions to our society’s problems. The idea is to empower others to speak louder.”
Needling the male players further, Rapinoe maintained that she has no fears about pushing her far-left political causes.
“I am lucky to have a bit of talent to lead these fights,” she concluded. “I have no fear, so I say what I say. Traveling all over for conferences and meetings exhausts me, but you have to be on the front line to improve things in our world.”
Rapinoe has been at the forefront of attacking America since 2016 when former NFL player Colin Kaepernick invented the protest against the country during the playing of the national anthem. Starting in 2016, Rapinoe has variously taken a knee during the anthem and refused to put her hand over her heart at the start of each game.
Rapinoe even refused to stand respectfully and sing the national anthem during her appearance at the World Cup games in France despite representing the U.S.A. at the Women’s World Cup games. She also refused to observe the anthem when the team had its triumphant victory parade in New York City.
Her protests became so vexing that in 2017 the U.S. national soccer team made a rule that all players must stand during the anthem.

"Republicans will claim that they prioritize pro-life policies, and democrats will keep abortion sacrosanct.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/15/8-nonpartisan-reasons-defund-planned-parenthood/,federalist,abortion,right,38.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Planned Parenthood engages in taxpayer waste, covering up sex abuse scandals, and hypocritical lobbying on issues of speech. Plus, it's not needed.
House Democrats want to reinstate international abortion funding. Planned Parenthood’s new CEO, Leana Wen, is focusing on abortion as the forefront of Planned Parenthood’s offerings and goals. And the March for Life is this Friday, where tens of thousands––perhaps even hundreds of thousands––of people will protest abortion in Washington DC.
The fact is that political parties are going to keep fighting on abortion. Republicans will claim that they prioritize pro-life policies, even though they didn’t defund Planned Parenthood or pass any federal bans when they controlled Congress and the White House. Meanwhile, Democrats will keep abortion sacrosanct.
Both parties are wrong: abortion should be ended. The first step to this should be a bipartisan ending of Planned Parenthood’s funding. To quote March For Life President Jeanne Mancini about America’s largest abortion company, “protecting vulnerable, unborn citizens should be a bipartisan goal.”
Planned Parenthood dominates the Democratic Party, even though Planned Parenthood violates a number of the party’s core principles. As shown below, women are harmed by Planned Parenthood, and the vulnerable––such as sex abuse victims and the unborn––are sacrificed for profit and political advance.
“Both parties ought to unite around redirecting” Planned Parenthood’s funding, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an email to me. She noted that other facilities offer all of Planned Parenthood’s non-abortion services and “vastly outnumber” the abortion giant’s locations.
Since SCOTUS showed last month that it is not willing to risk political controversy by hearing state-level defunding cases, it’s important that pro-life advocates create more of our kind to gain political advantage across all levels of government. To that end, here are eight nonpartisan reasons Planned Parenthood should be defunded.
1. The Unborn Are the Most Vulnerable People
The main argument for abortion is that what occupies a pregnant womb is not a human being. But science proves that unborn life begins in the womb. From Just Facts* comes proof––not the organization’s own opinion, but 10 original sources provided in just the short section below. Readers can click to each source from the numbered hyperlink to verify the original citation:
Fertilization normally takes place within one day of intercourse but can occur up to six days later. [34] [35]
At fertilization, humans’ genetic composition is formed. [36] This genetic information determines gender, eye color, hair color, and facial features. It also influences characteristics such as intelligence and personality. [37]
Per the medical textbook “The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology”: “fertilization” creates “a new combination of chromosomes that is different from that in the cells of either of the parents,” and this marks the “beginning of a new human being.” [38]
The four characteristics of life (growth, reproduction, metabolism, and response to stimuli) are present at fertilization. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43]
Unborn children feel pain, react to their surroundings, and have their own distinct blood. Their helplessness makes them the most vulnerable of all humans, a demographic Democrats stake their reputations on protecting.
This is the best reason Planned Parenthood should be defunded. It kills more than 320,000 human beings each year, according to its annual reports.
2. Planned Parenthood Covers Up Sex Abuse
Planned Parenthood has been accused by the pro-life group Live Action of hiding sex abuse. Live Action has undercover videos and personal testimonies to make its case. Planned Parenthood says Live Action is lying. It also has materials showing its support for survivors of sexual assault.
However, state officials in Alabama discovered that a Planned Parenthood center in Mobile covered up the suspected abuse of a 14-year-old girl. The girl already had two children and went to the center for two abortions in four months in 2014.
I spoke to a senior Alabama health official who defended giving Planned Parenthood a light punishment. Like every other state in the nation, Alabama requires health workers to report suspected abuse of minors. Planned Parenthood’s Mobile location didn’t do that. The official told me his department believed it was an error.
I asked the official if “essentially, your department was satisfied [Planned Parenthood] had acted in good faith, and not intentionally hid this information’ from child protective services.”
The official said that what I described was accurate. He also asked me to frame the situation differently to avoid pressure by the state’s pro-life advocates, saying it “would be much better” if LifeSiteNews “could word [the situation]in a way that [Planned Parenthood] had considered the possibility [of abuse] but simply hadn’t reported it, and after review with senior management, they are revising their policies, and they did report it, and they will report similar instances in the future.”
Got that? Alabama officials believed Planned Parenthood’s Mobile location accidentally broke a state law designed to protect minors, and that this should excuse their lack of protecting an abused minor.
3. Hurting Women In Other Ways
Did you know that research shows contraceptives can cause blood clots, death, glaucoma, gestational diabetes, breast cancer, depression, and general pain for women? Planned Parenthood acknowledges but downplays many such risks of contraceptives. Despite these risks, it gave out almost 2.7 million various contraceptives to women in 2016.
Planned Parenthood also ends the lives of about 6.6 percent of girls who would otherwise be born each year. The full calculations for that number may be seen here. About 157,000 unborn girls are denied the right to leave the womb and become women.
This 6.6 percent does not include sex-selective abortions. There is evidence this happens domestically. Planned Parenthood’s California chapter opposed a sex-selective abortion ban, even though the national Planned Parenthood says it opposes sex-selective abortions.
These numbers also do not include the many abortions that may be caused by several of the federally approved contraceptives that double as abortion-inducing drugs or devices.
One person who has seen firsthand how women are hurt by Planned Parenthood is Lauren Handy. A dedicated advocate for women considering abortion, she told me that she “purposely live[s] below the poverty line” so as to not support Planned Parenthood with tax dollars.
Handy said her activism started after “a woman just coming out of her abortion” was holding “her womb area in pain as her boyfriend dragged her along.” Handy “dropped out of college, sold all my belongings, and became a full-time pro-life missionary.” She holds signs in front of abortion centers which show graphic images of abortion victims, “medical diagrams of what the abortion procedure actually entails,” and provides non-abortive resources for desperate women.
4. Illegally Selling Baby Parts
Planned Parenthood has denied illegally selling baby body parts. These denials came despite federal and state criminal referrals and investigations. The district attorney in Orange County, California filed charges against two companies that allegedly partnered with Planned Parenthood. Those companies settled for almost $8 million, admitted fault, and stopped their work in California.
A court order has prevented any more of the Center for Medical Progress’s (CMP) videos, which allegedly show Planned Parenthood engaging in illegal activity, from being released. CMP lead investigator David Daleiden told me these videos “will be the final confirmation that Planned Parenthood and their business partners are guilty.”
If you haven’t watched the CMP videos, which were released in 2015, please do so. In one of them, baby body parts are piled like slabs of meat. Stopping this shouldn’t be controversial.
5. Medicaid Fraud And Taxpayer Waste
Congress should cut all inefficient and illegally spent money. This includes monies misspent by Planned Parenthood, an organization Dannenfelser described as “perpetually mired in scandals.”
For example, the Texas attorney general’s office found evidence that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (PPGC) engaged in fraud. PPGC denied the claims in 2013. It settled the case for $1.4 million. Wisconsin auditors found overpayments in 2014 at five Planned Parenthood centers and three other abortion centers.
Finally, the Alliance Defending Freedom and Charlotte Lozier Institute examined dozens of state audits and three federal audits, which show that Planned Parenthood centers across the country waste millions of taxpayer dollars. Even the state of New York––an abortion-friendly state––targeted Planned Parenthood in 2009 for overbilling.
Planned Parenthood For America did not respond to a request for comment about the audits and investigations.
6. Free Speech And Private Property Hypocrisy
Elected officials promise to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and public programs are subject to its protections. Despite receiving more than $540 million in public money, however, Planned Parenthood does not support free speech for all citizens.
For example, Planned Parenthood has sued to stop state and federal defunding efforts. It argues that eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood puts its rights and those of its clients at risk.
Yet Planned Parenthood backed a California law that would have forced pro-life centers to refer for abortion. Planned Parenthood wanted to force private citizens to speak their message. It also backed another California law that restricted the ability of journalists to engage in undercover investigations.
This hypocrisy also applies to property rights. Planned Parenthood backed the mobs which were arrested on Capitol Hill last year, saying “protest is patriotic.” Likewise, in 2014, people affiliated with the organization handed out condoms on Hobby Lobby property in protest of Hobby Lobby’s successful lawsuit against the Obama administration’s contraception mandate.
But again, Planned Parenthood seems to think protests are patriotic only when they support their narrative. Pro-life advocates outside of Planned Parenthood centers had to fight all the way to the Supreme Court in 2013 to be allowed within 35 feet of abortion centers in Massachusetts. Planned Parenthood lost that case, but it has consistently urged lawmakers to ban pro-life advocates from using public property for free speech.
7. Planned Parenthood Isn’t Needed
Public dollars should only be spent where necessary. While reasonable people can disagree on the existence of many federal and state programs, eliminating Planned Parenthood’s public sinecure is easy to justify on the basis that it is not necessary.
Pro-life pregnancy resource centers take care of pregnant women better than Planned Parenthood can. First, these centers provide free ultrasounds, maternity housing, adoption assistance, clothes, diapers, and more for women in desperate circumstances. Planned Parenthood charges for many of its services.
Second, pro-life centers outnumber abortion clinics. Best of all for those who are concerned about fiscal matters, most are privately funded, which protects taxpayers. In fact, taxpayers see a net benefit from pro-life centers. Citing a Charlotte Lozier Institute study published in 2018, Heartbeat International Director of Communications Andrea Trudden told me, “In 2017 alone, pregnancy help centers served more than 2 million women and men in the United States, saving taxpayers more than $161 million.”
Life Advancement Group* co-founder Benjamin Kraft said in an email that “these centers support women in many different situations, from first-time expecting mothers to single moms with multiple kids who are struggling to make ends meet.” According to Kraft, one center “provided more than 1,600 medical and support services to women in need” with just a $250,000 budget.
For Planned Parenthood’s other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and breast exams, federally-qualified health centers provide them. And it is these centers which pro-life groups have, for years, urged federal lawmakers to redirect Planned Parenthood’s funding because these centers provide other non-abortive services such as contraceptives.
So, again, clearly Planned Parenthood-specific funding isn’t necessary because what Planned Parenthood offers is either immoral or provided elsewhere. But it is also the case that some of the dollars should be eliminated from the federal budget forthwith instead of being redirected.
Such immoral ends should never be funded by the public. Additionally, rather than reduce abortion rates, research shows that widely available birth control increases the prevalence of abortion, above and beyond the abortion-inducing potential of several drugs and devices.
The least expensive and most effective option for birth control is abstinence. It’s free, and it’s 100 percent effective in all consensual circumstances. It is also the solution that calls upon adults to engage in sexual intercourse as adults instead of like children who feel entitled to using someone else’s money in their bedroom.
8. Planned Parenthood Uses Public Money For Political Advocacy
If the list above isn’t enough, Planned Parenthood uses taxpayer money to fund tens of millions of dollars of political advocacy. This is a favorite bipartisan activity. Politicians regularly give your money to their favored corporations, unions, and non-profit “charities” that are actually political advocacy groups.
Eliminating Planned Parenthood’s federal funding should be part of a bipartisan effort to clean house. Making our government smaller would ensure that tax dollars are used far more efficiently––whether for folks concerned about abortion, corporate farm subsidies, or our oversized Department of Defense. It would also reduce the influence of outside groups on our elected officials.

Ingraham began the exchange by noting American graduates’ salaries have been suppressed by the flood of foreign graduates.,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/01/12/donald-trump-we-dont-have-enough-foreign-workers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,immigration,right,39.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that several universities “sold” work permits or access to OPT visas. The permits and visas are provided by the federal government.
President Donald Trump told Fox News TV host Laura Ingraham on Friday his 2021 plans to welcome more foreign graduates will not flood the labor market for U.S. college graduates.
“I have so many companies coming into this country, you’re not going to have to worry about it,” Trump said in the interview, adding, “It is always going to be a shortage … We have so many companies coming in, from Japan … [and] China now is going to start building a lot of things.”
Trump and Ingraham did not find common ground, likely because they were talking about different parts of the immigration problem. Also, neither mentioned Ivanka Trump’s campaign to prod companies to train their own American employees for high-tech jobs.
Ingraham began the exchange by noting American graduates’ salaries have been suppressed by the flood of foreign graduates:
We don’t have a tight labor market. If we had a tight labor market, we would be seeing real increases in wages. I hear that your team is planning on advocating more foreign workers coming in for some of these high-tech companies.
Ingraham rejected business claims of shortages: “We’re seeing a plateauing of wages … There’s a never-ending appetite on the part of corporate America to bring in as much cheap labor as possible to drive down wages.”
“I’m not talking about cheap — I’m talking about brainpower,” Trump responded. “They want to hire smart people. And those people are thrown out of the country — we can’t do that,” he said, referring to foreign graduates of U.S. colleges.
Trump seems to want to help companies import a relatively small number of very clever people, such as Ivy League valedictorians. In contrast, Ingraham is trying to block companies’ effort to cut payrolls by replacing well-paid American professionals with cheap foreign graduates who have just enough skills to get the job done, regardless of quality.
“We have to allow smart people to stay in our country — if you graduate number one in your class at Harvard, [if] you graduate from the Wharton School of Finance,” Trump said. “If we tell smart people to get the hell out, that’s not America first.”
“Yes, that’s a small percentage of what [ccompanies] want,” said Ingraham.
” No, it’s not. It’s a lot,” said Trump.
But business has hired very few valedictorians among the pool of roughly 1.5 million visa workers who now hold jobs sought by American graduates.
In fact, the government does not require U.S companies to hire Americans first, and it does not screen out unskilled foreign workers. The government does not cap foreign hires and does not enforce the loopholed rules which supposedly require foreign workers to be skilled and to be paid market-level wages. Nor does the government even try to curb the large scale nepotism that allows foreign born managers in the United States to import huge numbers of foreign workers who will kick back some of their salaries to their bosses.
For example, the “Optional Practical Training” program was expanded by President G. Bush and President Barack Obama to provide employers with an extra stream of foreign graduates. Foreigners get these OPT work permits by simply enrolling in U.S. colleges, ranging from the elite Stanford University down to the so-called “visa-mill” colleges where many students can speak little English and may do very little study.
DHS posts videos of Indian migrants buying fake documents from ICE's Farmington U. sting operation.
The #OPT Optional Practical Training program is an estb.-run labor-trafficking scheme to sideline American graduates.
It will expand if #S386 becomes law https://t.co/d2sA6FQ3LK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 7, 2020
New 2018 data provided to Breitbart News by the Department of Homeland Security shows that universities provided 215,000 OPT work permits in 2018. This total consisted of 145,586 one-year OPT work permits and 69,650 three-year OPT-STEM work permits in 2018.
In 2017, the matching “Curricular Practical Training” program provided one-year work permits to roughly 100,000 foreign students at U.S. colleges — including colleges that require little or no attendance.
DHS officials have recently changed how they count the OPT and CPT work permits, so the estimated workforce now ranges from 400,000 to roughly 300,000. The older 2017 methodology was used to produce this DHS chart:
Many of these OPT graduates are hired by prestigious U.S. firms, — and by foreign managers in those elite firms — so demoting skilled U.S. graduates in lower-tier jobs, in lower-tier cities, at lower-tier wages.
The other major visa-worker program is the H-1B program. This program keeps roughly 750,000 foreign workers in U.S. college-graduate jobs. These foreign workers will often accept very low wages for these jobs — and will underbid American graduates — partly because they are hoping their employers will sponsor them for the hugely valuable prize of a green card.
Federal agencies have never released a full count of the resident H-1B workforce, but federal data shows that a huge percentage are not valedictorians and that many come from no-name universities in India.
The federal data for 2017, for example, shows that 39 percent of the H-1Bs sought by New York employers were rated as “entry-level” workers, similar to U.S. graduates. Another 26 percent were rated as just “qualified,” and only six percent were rated “competent.” These cheap workers have pushed hundreds of thousands of American professionals out of jobs.
This is the visa worker program which is used by companies to replace many Americans graduates. In 2016, for example, Disney outsourced Americans’ jobs to an Indian company that imported low-wage H-1B workers to do the Americans’ jobs. The American graduates were forced to train the Indians, torpedoing the claims of a shortage of skilled U.S. workers.
Ingraham reminded Trump of the Disney H-1B scandal. “You ran on people training their foreign replacements, that you ran against that. It’s humiliating for an American worker who works for a company for 30 years … to train your replacement,” Ingraham said.
“No, no, that’s different, I would never do that,” said Trump.
“Why shouldn’t we have American graduates of colleges and universities taking those jobs? Ingraham said.
“We do,” answered Trump. “But we don’t have enough of them … and we have to be competitive with the rest of the world too.”
But Trump’s deputies have done little to shrink the H-1B program. In fact, his deputies are defending the OPT program in court. Officials have also blocked a DHS plan to end the “H4 EAD” program that Obama created to persuade temporary H-1B workers to stay in U.S. jobs. The result is that many Americans are still being forced to train their workers, for example, at an AT&T finance office in North Carolina.
Polls show the public strongly prefers rules which require companies to hire Americans before importing more workers.
A Rasmussen survey shows likely voters by 2:1 want Congress to make companies hire & train US grads & workers instead of importing more foreign workers.
The survey also shows this $/class-based view co-exists w/ much sympathy for illegal migrants. #S386https://t.co/OSLHdG7Sni — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 30, 2019
Some of Trump’s supporters say his comments are demoralizing. “I gotta say just put myself through one hell of a three year period,” said one Twitter user, titled “Presto.” “Going to school for IT, working a fulltime meat cutting job all cause of the hope Donald Trump gave me. This clip kinda hurt a bit. This hurt me worse than any hit piece. Give me a spot in the middle class.”
But Trump’s focus on a relatively few valedictorians is a much lesser threat to Americans than the bipartisan push by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to pass his pending S.386 bill.
The bill would offer foreign OPT and H-1B workers a fast-track to a new status, dubbed “Early Adjustment,” once they can persuade — or pay — their employers to sponsor them for green cards. There is no limit on the number of OPT, CPT, or H-1Bs that can be awarded each year, nor any limit on the number of foreign graduates who can be sponsored for green cards by their employers. The lack of limits ensures that Lee’s bill would allow an unlimited flood of foreign college-graduates into the jobs needed by “Presto” and other Americans to get into or to stay in the middle-class.
Notably, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, has dismissed employers’ demands for more workers and insists they step up their training programs.
“I love what’s happening because it’s forcing employers to get creative,” Trump told Gary Shapiro, the longtime CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, during a January 7 interview at its annual meeting in Las Vegas. She added:
When I hear employers [who] would come to me and they’d say, ‘We need more skilled workers, we need more skilled workers,’ and then I’d read about them laying off segments of their workforce because they were investing in productivity, and not having spent the time — when they had known three years prior they’d be making that investment and upgrading those systems — not taking the time to take those workers and reskill and then retrain them into their job vacancies, well, I have very little sympathy for that.
Her push seems to be working.
Many U.S. companies are upgrading their training programs, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently showcased a company that uses software to identify and hire ordinary Americans — including truckers — who may have the intellectual skills to succeed in the software business.
Ivanka tells CEOs to train Americans before asking for more immigrants.
She stood up for unemployed, ex-cons, old ppl, blacks, disabled, & non-grads.

Before serving as President, Trump was an employer, and he has repeatedly shown his sympathy for fellow employers who complain about supposed labor shortages that would force them to compete for employees by offering higher wages. But he was elected on a pro-American promise — and he has raised Americans’ wages by repeatedly rejecting business demands for more, and yet more, imported workers.
Business leaders sometimes admit that an extra supply of workers helps them force down wages. “If you have ten people for every job, you’re not going to have a drive [up] in wages,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue told Breitbart News on January 9. But “if you have five people for every ten jobs, wages are going to go up.”","['suppressed', 'flood']"
"Should China be the first country to develop an effective vaccine, dictator Xi Jinping has promised to provide the world with “free” coronavirus vaccines paid for by Beijing. ",https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/06/30/china-tstart-injecting-soldiers-experimental-coronavirus-vaccine/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,vaccines,right,39.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"China has approved the use of an experimental coronavirus vaccine for members of the country’s military, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.
The vaccine, known as Ad5-nCoV, was reportedly developed by a team from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and Tianjin-based pharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics. In a statement Monday, CanSino announced that the vaccine candidate had successfully passed two phases of clinical trials indicating it was safe to use and would provide a “relatively high” immune response to the coronavirus antigen.
The essential phase three trials are yet to take place, which will confirm if the vaccine can successfully prevent infection. Phases one and two typically indicate whether the vaccine is safe for use without any unwarranted side effects, although all candidates must complete phase three to obtain and license to go on sale.
According to Major General Chen Wei, who led the vaccine’s development, the vaccine is based on a similar Ebola vaccine that he previously produced, and will join the range of drugs owned by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) for use in major outbreaks. As the vaccine has not yet been approved for general use, only the military will have access to it over the next year
The race to produce a coronavirus vaccine is a matter of overwhelming international significance, not just to bring the worldwide pandemic to an end, but also for countries to show that they are at the cutting edge of scientific research. Over a dozen vaccine candidates are currently in development around the world, including several from China. Other major trials are taking place at Oxford University in the United Kingdom and the Bar Ilan University in Israel.
Should China be the first country to develop an effective vaccine, dictator Xi Jinping has promised to provide the world with “free” coronavirus vaccines paid for by Beijing. However, China’s record of successfully producing vaccines in recent years has been so abysmal that communist state media openly admit that they prefer using international manufacturers.
The main issue has been that Chinese companies have deliberately produced watered down vaccines that do not produce the desired immunity, presumably in an attempt to maximize profits. One such company, Changsheng Biotechnology, produced and distributed nearly one million substandard vaccines to children across the country, leading to widespread protests and the company being hit with a $1.3 billion fine for malpractice.
The outbreak, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has wreaked devastation on the global economy and threatens to plunge hundreds of millions of people into poverty. As of Tuesday, more than 10 million cases of the virus have been recorded worldwide, leading to over half a million deaths.

CNN contributor and erstwhile New York City Democratic politician Christine Quinn said, “When a woman is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.”
When guest Rick Santorum asked CNN Host Chris Cuomo if he disagreed “that at the moment of conception that a child is human and alive?” Cumono replied that means it’s “viable.” When Santorum asked, “Is it biologically a human life?” Quinn shouted, “No!”
Cuomo and Quinn teamed up in pushing back on Santorum as he articulated what science tells us about unborn humans. At every stage of human life — as an embryo, a fetus, or after five weeks of age when his or her heartbeat can be detected by an ultrasound — an unborn child has his or her own unique DNA.
He or she has a unique genetic code, blood type, sex, and race, all which can differ from his or her mother and father’s. This unique individual is developed inside a women’s body, but is not part of a women’s body, and cannot be regulated as the mother’s property, Santorum argued.
“Her body is always her property,” Cuomo said, missing the point entirely.
“When a women is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her. It is part of her body,” Quinn said. “This is about a women having full agency and control of her body…and making decisions about what is part of her body with medical professionals.”
The right to abortion is just that — the right to kill unborn humans. But pro-abortionists like Quinn and Cuomo find it easier to argue that they are fighting for “reproductive rights” (even though pro-lifers are not objecting to any woman’s right to reproduce) or that fetuses are not humans but “clumps of cells.” Just as with slave owners and eugenicists before them, it’s easier for pro-abortionists to advocate for murder after they’ve dehumanized the lives they want to end.","['right', 'to', 'kill', 'eugenicists', 'slave', 'owners', 'clumps', 'of', 'cells', 'dehumanized', 'pro-abortionists', 'pro-lifers']"

Do we have the will to unite once more?
Are we at war? Did we pass that invisible line beyond which the country cannot hold? After everything the Democrats and the media have put us through since the election of Donald Trump, is it even possible to imagine peaceful reconciliation and common national purpose?
For a majority of Americans, the answers to those three questions are as obvious as they are dispiriting. That so many believe the country has fallen, is falling, or will be falling soon is a terrifying reality. An America that destroys itself will be like nothing the world has seen. If our institutions fall, if indiscriminate violence becomes the norm, if the economy crashes, we will condemn ourselves to not years, but decades of poverty and chaos.
For far too many on the left, chaos is the point. Destruction is the goal. They prefer the unknown madness that lies ahead to whatever is still managing to (barely) hold us together in the present.
Constitutional republicans often look at what the left unleashes and see no point in pretending that we are a nation at peace. Some would rather we finally end this lingering “cold civil war” and get down to the dirty business of fighting for America’s future.
Why doesn’t this prospect terrify every politician in the American government? Why do they work so hard to exacerbate the conflict when their offices and positions of power will be the first casualties of any actual war that tears this country apart? Are they all so blind to believe that they can lead a country to victory by destroying it?
How do we avoid a war that will end America when mayors, governors, congressmen, judges, journalists, and bureaucrats are all actively conspiring to drag us into the blaze?
On May 25, a black man died in police custody. We saw images of a police officer’s knee on the back of this man’s neck. Immediately, Americans—almost to a person—said, “This is wrong.”
There is no great divide on the moral question of what happened to George Floyd. There is no disagreement between the defenders of law and order and the defenders of civil liberty. In this case, law and order and civil liberty require the same response. All Americans should have been able to unite in condemning this injustice.
What happened instead? Radical leftists transformed a moment of national agreement into one of divisive conflict.
Americans united in their sense of what is just have no reason to destroy each other. Unity and agreement lead to peace. Uncorralled passion and grievance, however, can turn violence into a political opportunity.
The looting and riots and fires in blue cities across the country today reaffirm that it is not “justice” but “war” that today’s radicals have in mind. From a moment that brought all Americans together in their sense of right and wrong, politicians and groups bent on destabilizing the nation chose division…and got their way.
After nights of murder and loss, President Trump walked to a firebombed church with a Bible in hand. There was a moment to de-escalate. There was an opportunity to choose calm. There was a chance for reconciliation. Instead, CNN accused the president of hurting “peaceful protesters” for a photo op. Some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country call him a fascist, a bigot, and a murderer.
When every act of peace is treated like war, and every act of war is treated like justice, how do Democrats expect to preserve a future America for them to lead?
If Democrats believe that creation can only come from wanton destruction, how can we ever trust them to choose peace when they have an opportunity to destroy?
Breaking store windows, setting buildings on fire, vandalizing monuments to American heroes, leaving graffiti threats on synagogue walls, attacking Christian churches and tombstones, terrorizing the living, and giving no peace to the dead— these are the great accomplishments of Antifa and those they egg on. They have given America her own “Kristallnacht” and still fail to see the sad irony. Or maybe they understand it completely. Maybe it’s only sad to those with their eyes and ears open because the press so easily missed the joke.
Most Americans had no idea that leftists thought setting the nation on fire was akin to the Boston Tea Party. Though most Americans who’ve been paying attention never really understood how Democrats could so easily join hands with Iran’s Ayatollah, the Chinese Communist Party, dangerous drug cartels on our southern border, and international corporations that have strengthened China at the expense of the American worker. How can Democrats be friends with so many of our enemies and pretend—with a straight face—that they are still our friends as well?
If America is to survive, something new must take hold right now. The current political parties and officeholders and corporate-owned media are not up to the task.
Politicians who cheer on destruction should be behind bars, not before microphones.
Those who directly or indirectly fund mayhem and destruction should be in courtrooms defending their actions, not hiding on palatial estates while applauding the carnage.
Social media giants who act as authoritarian state censors should not be afforded extra-constitutional protections while they work to undermine the rights of everyone else.
If we will unite together once more, America may well recover. If we do not, it’s future survival could be in danger. We must stand up to the insurrectionists all around us—and we must do so today, lest it becomes that much harder to do so tomorrow.
Tolerance for criminality and political sabotage has led us to the edge of a dangerous cliff. We will either dig our heels into the ground and push back or we risk falling into the murky depths below.","['terrorizing', 'peace', 'attacking', 'great', 'accomplishments', 'egg']"

It appears Schiff failed to hear the outcome of a two-year, unlimited-resources special counsel investigation that found Trump’s campaign had not colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But Schiff doesn’t care about the facts. He cares about winning. If lying makes him win, so be it. It obviously works extremely well for Democrats, a large faction and the leadership of which appears to be as impervious to facts as anti-vaxxers and QAnon followers.

Contra Schiff, Todd, and Nadler, about six in ten Americans think impeachment should be resolved not by Congress, but by voters in the next election. Sixty percent of Americans Politico polled in November said the impeachment inquiry is more important to politicians and the media than it is to them.
On that poll, impeachment ranked 10 out of 11 political priorities voters were polled about, below even addressing climate change. The economy, national security (including border security), and health care are voters’ top three priorities.
It’s Our Congress and We’ll Lie If We Want To
But Democrats don’t seem to care what voters want. Since 2016, Democrats have thrown sand, wrenches, and donkey poo into every gear of government to overturn the results of a free and fair election played by rules (i.e. the Electoral College) known to all in advance. They’ve attempted at every point to undermine the election results and deny the spoils due the victor. Rather than attempting to advance fairly by persuading more people of their ideas, they’ve resorted to unending, underhanded tricks to win despite failing to present a vision for the country that can fairly win a governing majority.
The most constant of these tricks might be the personal smears constantly and thickly applied to everyone on the right. It’s not just Trump who is a racist. Everyone who believes in free markets and equality before the law is a racist. That may sound crazy, but that’s what lefty college students scream at mainstream conservatives constantly, and they aren’t getting these ideas from their own empty brains.
Or try unsupported sexual and other assault charges, as deployed against Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, Sen. Ted Cruz, and initial Trump nominee for labor secretary Andy Pudzer. Even if there is no evidence for them and evidence against, such accusations will make life hell for the accused, make huge numbers of people suspicious of their accomplishments, and occupy months of congressional resources that they could be using on the people’s business.
Same thing for basic obstruction of judicial nominees: “Since President Donald Trump took office, the… percentage of judicial nominees facing opposition – even a single vote – to confirmation has skyrocketed from the traditional 3 percent to more than 70 percent.”
Then there’s always the good old lawsuit. The left has specialized in suing President Trump’s administration for doing exactly the same things President Obama did, simply in reverse and in closer contact with the law. They’ve also specialized in using biased judges as unelected superlegislatures to impose national dictats: “nationwide injunctions were never employed for the first 175 years of our republic. But… [they] were used 22 times within the president’s first two years in office.”
This has allowed, for one example, “a single unelected judge appointed by the opposition party [to control] the nation’s immigration policy for now three years despite an election in which the American people voted for a man who promised to reverse that policy to instead follow the actual law.”
It doesn’t stop there, of course. Attorney General William Barr noted “the pursuit of scores of parallel ‘investigations’ through an avalanche of subpoenas” that are “plainly designed to incapacitate the Executive Branch.”
Atop all this are other leftist mobilizations against the people’s decision in 2016: bureaucrats paid by taxpayers contemptuously organizing against their elected boss, the two-year Spygate hoax that appears to comprise the Obama administration using government resources and Soviet-style allegations to spy on their political opposition, and the public harassment of Trump officials to the point of following them into restaurants and their homes screaming, shouting, banging drums, whistling, and shouting threats.
In short, the left’s response to the right scoring a goal in 2016 was to grab the ball and stomp their feet for three years, like the protesters stopping the Yale-Harvard football game to protest climate change. But in Congress, the stakes are a lot higher than football.
To give just one example, while everyone is force-fed impeachment drivel, Congress is busy not passing another regular budget for its 23rd straight year. We’ve been run for a quarter-century on crap-sandwich “continuing resolutions” that are bringing us frighteningly close to curb-stomping the world’s largest economy.
Rachel Bovard points out at American Greatness other things Congress is not doing while impeachment sucks oxygen:
There is also no effort to limit any money going to Planned Parenthood or to pass legislation such as the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act… President Trump has requested $5 billion to continue building a wall along the southern border. It goes without saying that Democrats are opposed, but it doesn’t appear that Republicans are prepared to put up much of a fight for the president’s signature priority, either. Legislators also continue to ignore the fact that Mexico is rapidly descending into a gangland—a problem that Congress could begin to address by designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. But don’t expect that to be included in any spending bill, either.
There is a silver lining to Democrats’ obstruction. In the past century, when Congress has gotten together to “get things done” it has done more harm than good. In Washington DC, “bipartisanship” is the equivalent for conservatives of pointing a cannon at their own ship’s floorboards and firing. “Bipartisanship” means Democrats get half of what they want and Republican voters get screwed.
This good ol’ boys national suicide compact of the last century has produced a legislative vertical asymptote, with socialism as infinity.
Inaction Is Action
Gridlock and inactivity is better than that. Or at least, it will be until our entitlements actually do explode, which is set to begin within seven years. At that point, inaction will no longer be an option.
Bipartisanship as we know it is probably over, and Obamacare probably fired the kill shot. In fact, we may already be past the point on entitlements where not acting equals acting.
The same is true of the southern border, as Mexico also slow-motion implodes. U.S. classrooms where 15 languages are already represented are not going to handle well even more poorly educated non-citizens entitled by court decisions to a taxpayer-provided U.S. education, and that’s just the start of the impending strain on America’s poorly maintained and outdated social infrastructure.
This is unacceptable. It is not the behavior of a party ready to govern.
Democrats are spending their time grandstanding because they’re out of winning ideas. They have only negative ideas — “income inequality,” “collusion,” “white privilege,” “America sucks,” “toxic masculinity,” “socialism” — nothing positive. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s caucus is so crazy left that if they actually passed the laws they want, like with Obamacare, they’d lose elections good and hard. They win more when they do nothing but slime and delegitimize their opponents and keep them in the mud losing, too.
Yet Republicans are also rightfully in the wilderness. They’ve been Democrats’ impressionable little brother for too long, adopting the same ideas but slower, smaller, and cheaper. Their inability to present a robust alternative is another reason to beware them taking power. Why, the last time they had it, just a short year ago, they squandered the golden opportunity of the first House, Senate, and presidency controlled by Republicans since George W. Bush, which until then hadn’t happened in 79 years and was also squandered profligately.
Under Bush, we got garbage like No Child Left Behind, the neverending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Patriot Act, and a massive Medicare expansion. When Republicans retook all houses under Trump, they failed to move legislation they’d been campaigning on for the entirety of President Obama’s tenure (cough cough, Obamacare replacement; Planned Parenthood defunding), not to mention nothing major Trump had campaigned on except a tax cut. Current promises of price controls to “help” with prescription drugs, a surely pork-stuffed “infrastructure” bill, and Republicans’ lame answers to Democrats’ demands for socialized college inspire no confidence, either.
This is unacceptable. It is not the behavior of a party ready to govern. When governing was possible, Republicans diddled. They appear to have no big ideas for future governance, either. Democrats’ unhinged circus is a just punishment for Republicans’ failure to deserve majority votes. It’s long past time for the GOP to figure out what they’re going to do about our nation’s serious problems if they ever win again, and develop the political courage to advance those ideas under fire.",['sandbag']
China appears to be feeding off similar complaints from the left in the United States. Complaints about partisan “gridlock” are perennial and grow especially loud when Democrats and their highly sympathetic media are the ones complaining about Republicans getting in their way.,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/06/02/chinese-state-media-dings-obama-and-democrats-for-years-of-negligence-of-race/,breitbart,elections-2020,right,40.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Chinese state media outlets have been bursting with criticism for President Donald Trump during the current round of riots, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also tossed a few bricks at former President Barack Obama and his Democrat Party, needling them for doing little about racial issues and touting China’s efforts to care for its poor and disenfranchised as vastly superior to the Democrats’ half-hearted socialism.
China – the country that throws its minorities into concentration camps and uses them for slave labor, the brutal authoritarian regime driven by Han Chinese racial supremacist ideology, the government that thinks nothing of wiping out entire villages if it needs to build a few dams quickly to put on a good show for the Olympics – boasted of its superior compassion and tolerance in the pages of the CCP’s Global Times on Monday:
During the riots, a large part of the protesters’ grievances came from the fact that they, as the people at the bottom, suffered most of the pain caused by the novel coronavirus epidemic. Because the campaign strategy of the president’s team is to downplay the pain of the epidemic, the White House has rarely mentioned the epidemic in the past week, except when it needed to exploit the virus to attack China. The US is not there for ethnic minorities and poor people. Through the epidemic and the attitude of the ruling elites in the riots, people can see that these groups live in desperation. Because the poor have no way to unite under the US system and can easily be divided, their common dissatisfaction has a limited impact on elections, and they have never become the focus of attention of policymakers. China’s massive poverty alleviation program is just unthinkable in the US. The frosty attitude of capitalism against the vulnerable groups has been laid bare in the past few months. The poor in the US are experiencing a very bad 2020.
According to the Global Times, this sorry state of affairs in the United States is an inevitable result of multi-party democracy. If America was smart and had only a single party like China, partisan squabbles would be ended and so much more could be done for the poor by their efficient and unified authoritarian government.
“Partisan politics has created severe divisions in society,” the Communist paper lectured. “Such divisions restrict and disturb people’s thinking. People’s support for a particular party is only a matter of stance, which provides a shelter to politicians who violate people’s interests. As elections come and go, it is simply about one group of elites replacing the other. The intertwined interests between the two groups are much greater than those between the victorious one and the electorate who vote for them.”
China appears to be feeding off similar complaints from the left in the United States. Complaints about partisan “gridlock” are perennial and grow especially loud when Democrats and their highly sympathetic media are the ones complaining about Republicans getting in their way. Left-wingers daydreamed during the Obama years about how much good their noble president could do if he possessed the dictatorial powers of Chinese dictator Xi Jinping.
“One-party autocracy certainly has its drawbacks. But when it is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people, as China is today, it can also have great advantages,” New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote in September 2009, laying out the thesis for much of his political coverage of the Obama administration.
It will come as a great disappointment to those who share Friedman’s admiration for the reasonably enlightened rulers of China that they do not think much of how Barack Obama handled racial issues during his presidency.
Another Global Times editorial on Tuesday chided the American media for forgetting that “the country’s escalating racial tension is not only Trump’s fault,” but also “stems from years of negligence by the Obama administration.”
The Global Times cited polls that showed “one of the highest levels of discord since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles” was reached during the last year of the Obama administration and that Americans were generally disappointed with Obama’s handling of racial issues at the end of his term compared to their lofty expectations at the beginning. It further quoted a BBC analysis that dinged Obama for being in charge when the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement began.
“With these facts and arguments in mind, it is reasonable to doubt a Biden presidency, should he win this November, will put more focus on healing race relations than Obama’s two terms of presidency – especially with the coronavirus still wreaking havoc throughout the country and a roiling recession with no easy end in sight,” the CCP paper said.
“The fact that George Floyd’s tragic death happened in a ‘blue state,’ in a Democrat-controlled city, is adding another layer of doubt whether a Biden presidency will offer anything significant better than Obama, or Trump,” the Global Times added.
The article concluded with another variation on the CCP’s theme that the American system is inferior to China’s brand of one-party fascist rule: “African Americans, as well as other minorities who suffer inequality, won’t see their agony end if they are stuck choosing either group of politicians. But what other option do they have?”","['highly', 'sympathetic', 'feeding']"
"There can be no serious discussion of this issue, however, in 60-second sound bites. So, beyond the soak-the-rich shtick that shades every Democratic economic debate point, the candidates resorted to two tactics: shock and sob stories.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/15/student-debt-willingly-took-not-problem-solve/,federalist,student-debt,right,40.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Of all the pandering showcased during Democrats’ attempts to win back the presidency, wiping out student debt ranked at or near the top.
“I believe that education is the future for this country,” socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders barked during the first round of Democratic primary debates, explaining that’s why we must “eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke similarly. “I can tell you this,” the Minnesota senator demagogued, “if billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.”
There can be no serious discussion of this issue, however, in 60-second sound bites. So, beyond the soak-the-rich shtick that shades every Democratic economic debate point, the candidates resorted to two tactics: shock and sob stories.
The Shock Strategy
The size of student debt provides the jolt necessary to peddle their plans to the American populace. “I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself,” California Rep. Eric Swalwell bemoaned. “College affordability is personal for us,” South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared, noting that his household has “six-figure student debt.” So, sure, “I believe in reducing student debt,” Buttigieg announced.
Next came the sob stories. Those student loans are suffocating a generation, the candidates suggested. After all, “40 million of us who can’t start a family,” the diaper-changing daddy Swalwell contradictorily proclaimed, adding that they “Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.”
“We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on,” frontrunner Joe Biden agreed.
Tellingly, when not constrained by the debate format, these same politicians push the same narrative to garner support for bailing out student loans, all while the media provides the Democrats a free assist.
“With loans totaling more than $130,000,” Buttigieg’s household is “among the 43 million people in the United States who owe federal student loan debt,” the Associated Press reported last month, before highlighting the myriad plans to bail out student debt pushed by a cadre of presidential candidates. The AP then furthered the narrative by using statistics to shock the public into socialism:
The debtors are so numerous and the total debt so high—more than $1.447 trillion, according to federal statistics—that several of the Democratic candidates have made major policy proposals to address the crisis. Their ideas include wiping away debt, lowering interest rates, expanding programs that tie repayment terms to income and making college free or debt-free. Student loan debt is often discussed as an issue that mostly affects millennials, but it cuts across age groups. Federal statistics show that about 7.8 million people age 50 and older owe a combined $291.9 billion in student loans. People age 35 to 49, a group that covers older millennials such as Buttigieg as well as Generation X, owe $548.4 billion. That group includes more than 14 million people.
Sob Stories Reign Supreme
Then the sad tales continue the sales pitch for a government solution to student debt—a ploy that began well before the 2016 elections. Here’s one of myriad media examples.
“Shayna Pilnick, 28, would like to buy an apartment but can’t afford a mortgage. Jacqueline Mannino, 23, and her boyfriend, Benjamin Prowse, 26, want to get married. Jacob Childerson, 24, and his wife, Jennifer, 25, wish they could start a family, but they live with Jennifer’s parents,” is how USA Today opened its 2013 profile of millennials unable to obtain their dream life because they are “tethered” to “tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.”
There are many ways to counter these arguments, based on both economics and equity. But it’s hard to counter soundbites with sense, so instead, here are my inquiries for these politicians, the press, and all the students demanding relief from the burdens of their debt: Tell me your sob stories from age 12 on, not what you can’t do now, but what you couldn’t do then. Tell what you had to do then and through college to avoid what is now, to you, crushing student debt.
What time did you get up to deliver papers in junior high? How many hours a week did you work since 14 to save for college? How many toilets did you scrub? How many high school football games did you miss because you were working? What dream college did you forgo to avoid taking out student loans?
Which 8 a.m. class did you take so you could complete your major’s requirements and still work in the afternoon? Which bus line did you take to get to your job because you didn’t borrow to buy a car? What job did you work full-time while completing your MBA at night?
What did you do to afford college? What didn’t you do because of the cost of college? Were you getting tattoos and traveling your way through college? Were you pledging and partying? Did you go to your top-choice university? Maybe an out-of-state public university with higher tuition rates? Which spring break and study abroad destinations did you visit along the way?
Did you splurge on your fairytale wedding instead of paying down your student loans? What cars did you buy or lease? Where did you live? What electronics did you own? What clothing and other personal expenditures did you have? In short, show me the money and how you spent it!
None of my business? You’re right. Nor is your student debt my business or my problem.","['shock', 'and', 'sob', 'stories', 'shtick', 'shades', 'soak-the-rich']"

Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.",['dumb']
"For several years, climate change doomsayers have turned their attention to cattle, as a series of reports demonstrated that “livestock emissions” are more dangerous for the environment than automobiles.",https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2019/06/17/german-green-party-proposes-ban-on-all-industrial-farming/,breitbart,environment,right,41.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The Green party in Germany said it will ban industrial farming to reduce global warming if it comes to power.
The measure was proposed by Katrin Goering-Eckardt, the party’s leader in the Germany parliament, as part of a massive €100 billion project to finance climate initiatives.
For several years, climate change doomsayers have turned their attention to cattle, as a series of reports demonstrated that “livestock emissions” are more dangerous for the environment than automobiles.
A 2016 article at EcoWatch declared that greenhouse gas emissions from livestock account for a higher percentage of total global emissions than the world’s 1.2 billion automobiles.
Whereas the entire transportation sector accounts for only some 14 percent of global emissions, cows produce a remarkable 14.5 to 18 percent of the global total, the article noted.
Already in 2012, a United Nations report had asserted that the earth’s cattle population produces more CO2 than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined. Moreover, between belching, defecation, and flatulence, cows produce a third of the world’s methane emissions, which are considered 20 times more detrimental to the environment than carbon dioxide.
Radical greens concluded that it is time to reduce the global cow population, which means dramatically reducing western consumption of meat. As a result, vegans, vegetarians, and animal rights activists have joined climate change agitators in insisting that meat-eating is no longer an ecologically acceptable human activity.
In 2013, Germany’s Green party sought to launch a weekly “veggie day,” a project that reportedly failed to garner much support from ordinary citizens.
Recalling this fiasco, Christian Lindner, the leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, warned last week that the Greens “dream of a meat-less country.”
“Whoever wants to be vegan is free to do so, but the rest of us shouldn’t be banned from eating our schnitzel,” Mr Lindner said.
Nonetheless, Ms. Goering-Eckardt said that public attitudes have changed since then, and she believes that Germans are now more willing to make sacrifices to curb global warming.
“Many people have now understood that things are going to change fundamentally,” she said. “The question is whether we make the changes ourselves or allow ourselves to be swept over by the climate crisis.”
The politician did acknowledge that the “monumental task” of combating climate change would demand “massive investment” over a short time frame.

Another spin operation appears to be afoot to thwart Attorney General William Barr’s investigation into the Russia collusion hoax and others perpetrated by high-ranking federal bureaucrats. The eye of the hurricane this weekend has focused on the Department of Justice, with news Friday that an assistant U.S. attorney declined to press charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for documented lying to federal investigators under oath.

IG report on Andrew McCabe: Misled Investigators over roll in news media disclosure…Lacked Candor (Lied) on four separate occasions…Authotized Media Leaks to advance personal interests…IG RECOMMENDED MCCABE’S FIRING. @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2020
Becket Adams explains that:
In 2016, McCabe, who is now a paid CNN contributor, leaked sensitive details of the bureau’s investigation of the Clinton Foundation to the press. He then misled members of the FBI’s Inspection Division when they interviewed him about the leaks, according to a February 2018 Justice Department inspector general report. McCabe provided investigators with four misleading statements, three of which were while he was under oath. Giving false statements to federal investigators is a crime. In fact, it is the same crime for which the Justice Department went after President Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.
On Friday, news broke that Barr “has appointed the top federal prosecutor in St. Louis to review the criminal case against Michael Flynn – former national security adviser to President Donald Trump,” according to Reuters. This all occured in the same week an assistant U.S. attorney recommended up to nine years in prison for former Trump campaign associate Roger Stone on the grounds that he lied about gossiping about what WikiLeaks knew about Hillary Clinton’s emails.
So it appears McCabe is allowed to lie to federal investigators about corruption affecting the U.S. government, cover it up with more lies, and get off scot-free even though what he did is a crime, while Stone faces years in prison for lying about gossip that affected nothing of public importance. Flynn appears to have been entrapped by FBI agents into possibly contradicting himself while unaware that was the situation, and now faces possible prison time, to say nothing of years of legal harassment plus potential threats by prosecutors against his son. Andrew McCarthy points out the same double standard has applied to the political prosecution of former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, who “was convicted of making a trivial false statement about the date of a meeting.”
CNN’s Erin Burnett made a big deal Friday out of a federal judge saying last September that politicized decisions about whom federal lawyers prosecute are the stuff of a “banana republic.” She attempted to apply that description to the Trump Justice Department’s revisions to its prison-time request for Stone.
Yet it far better applies to unelected career bureaucrats’ use of their power to prosecute their political enemies, which comprises the heart of the “resistance” to Republican rule that will endure so long as bureaucracy has enough power to challenged elected branches of government. This bureacracy weaponization was also a hallmark of the Obama presidency, with — ironies of ironies — perhaps the biggest evidences again coming from the Department of Justice under attorneys general Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.
Remember them? The people who held tarmac meetings with Bill Clinton about hiding Hillary’s email scandal, oversaw Internal Revenue Service persecution of conservative grassroots clubs, and refused to enforce immigration laws at the behest of the president?
Now the chest-thumpers in the media are coming to obscure this weaponization of bureaucracy by attacking Trump’s frustration over the outrageous and corrupt double standards of an executive branch federal agency he is supposed to control through appointing its leaders. On Sunday, “More than 1,000 former U.S. Justice Department officials on Sunday called for Attorney General William Barr to resign” for directing the department he ostensibly controls to reduce its requested prison sentence for Stone.
On Friday, coinciding directly with the announcement of McCabe’s effective federal pardon, Sally Yates, of all people, was published in the Washington Post accusing Trump of treating Justice as “his personal grudge squad.” Yes, the deputy attorney general who helped the Obama administration set up Flynn as an early fall guy in the Spygate scandal is now taking to the pages of the Washington Post to wax poetic about DOJ’s duty to provide “impartial justice” and perform as a “neutral zone” that provides “justice without fear or favor.”
“While it is appropriate to communicate about administration policies and priorities, discussion with the White House about specific criminal cases has traditionally been off-limits,” Yates writes. Is that so? Then why was Yates, according to Obama official Susan Rice, at a meeting with President Obama about the administration’s “investigation” into the political opponents soon replacing them in the White House? Why did she “run to the White House and get it on the record that she believed Flynn to be in imminent danger of becoming a compromised national security liability, despite being fully aware that such compromise was impossible”?
Only if Yates is using cynical lies to cover her behind from what everybody will learn she and other Obama administration officials did with their power if Barr is not stopped, soon.
When the cockroaches are all scurrying across the floor, you can be sure that somebody shone a light on their nest. Earlier this week, in fact, House intelligence committee ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes told Fox Business host Lou Dobbs that the prosecutors who resigned over the altered prison recommendation for Stone are “not going to be the only example. We think there’s other examples of things that they did during the Mueller investigation that I think you and your listeners and the American people will be very interested to learn in the coming weeks, as we start to unpeel the onion of what the Mueller team was really doing.” More:
NUNES: Because I would say this, when Mueller was appointed, you have — we have to ask ourselves, he walks in the door the first day and said, OK, show me all the evidence you’ve got on the Russians. They’re like, Bob, sorry, we don’t have any Russians here. We don’t have any evidence. DOBBS: Yes. NUNES: So what the h-ll did they do for two years? They set up an obstruction of justice trap. And they sit — DOBBS: And tried — NUNES: — they went after a whole bunch of people that now got sentenced. Some already served their time. And I think all of this has to come into question now at this point.
Then on Friday, former special counsel Robert Mueller’s top “pit bull,” Andrew Weissmann, whom some speculate was the actual leader of Democrats’ unlimited Trump probe, told MSNBC host Chuck Todd that Barr’s agency has opened another investigation into McCabe plus fellow FBI corrupt-o-crats James Comey and Peter Strzok.
The real investigators are closing in on the crooked cops. No wonder they’re freaking out and using their media friends to start helping them pretend all of a sudden that they care about “democracy” while using their power to subvert the presidential administration Americans elected in 2016. What Barr is doing is what “oversight” looks like: When unelected bureaucrats are called to publicly account for what they have done with the public purse, time, and trust.
Once the whole truth has finally come out, Congress needs to be thinking about how they are going to make sure this never happens again. They will not do that by making the Department of Justice even less accountable to elected officials, as Democrats are demanding. They will do it by slashing and burning the bureaucracy and its powers. Government by and for the people will perish from the earth if unelected officials are capable of weaponizing government against the people’s elected representatives. That’s what a banana republic really is. And we don’t want one here.","['weaponization', 'ironies', 'of']"

Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.”
Some religious leaders found it “baffling and reprehensible” that the St. John Paul II National Shrine would allow the president to visit with First Lady Melania Trump, who is Catholic.
Actually, the opposition to the President’s actions is baffling. Every religious leader should be cheering the president’s expression of faith and commitment to religious liberty.
Before the nation became engulfed in violence sparked in part by the death of George Floyd and in large measure by unrelated agendas of violent agitators, the president had planned to sign an executive order on international religious freedom at the John Paul II Center.
“This was fitting,” according to a statement on the Shrine’s Twitter page, “given John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate.”
President Trump, too, is committed to preserving religious liberty in our nation and in the world but that one unassailable fact is conveniently overlooked by his critics.
Trump has been a tireless advocate for religious freedom during his presidency, beginning with an executive order close to my heart that he signed during a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2017, just over three months into his term. My colleague Alveda King, who leads our Civil Rights for the Unborn outreach, was there to represent Priests for Life.
That order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954. President Trump’s Department of Justice backed that up with a memo to the Internal Revenue Service in 2018, ordering agents not to enforce the Johnson Amendment.
The order also took the side of Priests for Life against the Obama mandate that every employer must provide abortifacient drugs and devices to their employees. Priests for Life was among dozens of petitioners who challenged that Obama mandate all the way up to the Supreme Court. In 2018, HHS finalized a rule that protected faith-based organizations from that mandate.
Also in 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the formation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in the HHS Office for Civil Rights. President Trump created the office to protect the conscience rights of health-care workers whose religious beliefs do not allow them to take part in abortion or assisted suicide.
In 2019, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs allowed Bibles on their premises once again. Also that year, the president lifted a ban on providing federal funds to faith-based black colleges and universities.
The president has also endorsed Bible literacy in public schools, defended the rights of students to pray, and defended faith-based adoption agencies that have been under attack for declining to place children in same-sex households.
He has looked at every place in our society where religious liberty is threatened, and taken steps to protect it. I have lost track of the number of special actions President Trump’s Administration has taken to make the federal government and public life in general more hospitable to citizens and organizations of Faith.
It is absolutely refreshing and inspiring.
He continued those efforts this week.
On Tuesday, as his visit to a Catholic shrine was being decried in the media, President Trump signed an order that would prioritize religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy.
This is a president committed to preserving and protecting the religious liberty every American is guaranteed under the First Amendment, and that everyone in the world is guaranteed by their human dignity.
Did President Trump have the right to hold a Bible aloft in front of a church? You bet he did.
The Democrats, and their media mouthpieces, have gone too far in criticizing the president over what they called a stage-managed photo op. Yet this kind of criticism is more and more characteristic of their party and its leaders.
In 2015, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton infamously said that “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed” (emphasis mine). These Democrats want to change people’s religious beliefs, and they think they have to right to do that.
In his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O’Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else!
Biden says he’s a Catholic, goes to Mass on Sunday, and believes that mothers should be able to have their children killed up until their due dates and that U.S. taxpayers should pay for it! During his lackluster campaign, Biden has said “We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.”
On this point he is absolutely right. And winning that battle demands keeping these morally misguided Democrats out of office.

Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes.
“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice,” he said. “We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.”
The actor then bore down on animal rights, specifically the life cycle of a cow.
“I think that we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world, and many of us, what we’re guilty of is an egocentric worldview — the belief that we’re the center of the universe,” he said.
“We go into the natural world, and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. Then, we take her milk, that’s intended for her calf, and we put it in our coffee and our cereal, and I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.”

"But if you major in philosophy or gender studies, you might struggle to find any job in your field, let alone a well-paying one.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/19/student-debt-crisis-students-fault-shouldnt-get-bailout/,federalist,student-debt,right,42.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"When President Trump rolled out his recent budget proposal, it made some cuts that were always going to cause controversy. For one thing, his plan would slash subsidized student loan repayment plans, and let the government crack down on missed payments. To left-wing politicians who think the state should hand out more subsidies, this might as well have been Armageddon.
Yet while 45 million Americans are on the hook for more than $1.4 trillion in student debt, Americans should realize that millennials don’t need a government bailout or intervention. The student debt crisis isn’t as bad as it seems, and it’s a “crisis” of our own making.
Choices Have Consequences
The average college graduate leaves school with around $31,000 in debt, which certainly sounds like a lot, but that’s just a monthly payment of approximately $300. So why are students really struggling to repay their loans?
Much of it comes down to choice. If you choose to study business, economics, engineering, computer science, or anything practical, you could see a starting salary of anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000. For people who make this much, it’s not very difficult to pay a few hundred dollars per month for student loans. With unemployment at its lowest levels in years, the labor market is tight enough that a new graduate with a useful degree shouldn’t have any trouble getting started in the workforce.
But if you major in philosophy or gender studies, you might struggle to find any job in your field, let alone a well-paying one. According to The Atlantic, “Underemployment afflicts more than 50 percent of majors in the performing arts, anthropology, art history, history, communications, political science, sociology, philosophy, psychology, and international affairs.”
Not everyone can be an engineer or a doctor, but anyone can find an area where his interests intersect with actual job prospects. Students can also double major, and gain practical experience in one field while exploring another. So if you decided a career in art history was worth the price, it shouldn’t be the government’s job to pay the bill for your student loans––even if it’s not your fault that the cost of college has exploded in recent years.
You Don’t Accidentally Rack Up Six Figures in Debt
Part of the reason the reaction to student loans has been so extreme is because horror stories once viral now seem normal, and most people know graduates with $100,000 or even more than $200,000 in debt. If bureaucrats weren’t wasting taxpayer dollars, and state governments weren’t pulling back their financial support for higher education, maybe these students wouldn’t be in that situation.
Still, there are only a few ways to acquire hundreds of thousands in debt. Maybe you went to an expensive private college for four years, or got a graduate degree. If you chose a lavish, $60,000 per-year private school like Trinity or Fordham, that’s your own fault. Average cost of attendance at a four-year public school is around $20,000 (and that’s before financial aid or scholarships, which many students receive)––so if you’re buried in hundreds of thousands in debt, it’s because you made a decision you couldn’t afford.
For graduate students, it’s understandable that they’ve taken on so much in loans, as some advanced degrees can take seven or even eight years to complete. But they don’t need the government’s help to pay back their debt. The expected lifetime earnings for someone with a doctoral degree totals $3.3 million.
I’d Rather See a Concert than Pay My Loan
Many millennials aren’t paying back their student loans. But is that because they truly can’t? In 2016, 1.1 million graduates defaulted on their loans for the first time, yet their ability to make payments might not be the problem.
When a survey asked recent graduates what they would sacrifice to pay off their debt, “less than half were willing to do without concert tickets, lattes, food delivery, alcohol purchases or travel.” Around 15 percent didn’t even know how much money they owed. Nearly a third of students polled planned to use some of their student loan money to pay for their spring break trips, while 23 percent said they had used loans to purchase alcohol, and 6 percent said they used the money for drugs. We have a student debt crisis, but the real issue isn’t the number on the balance sheet. It’s a generation trapped in perpetual adolescence, confused about how to get out.
Years ago, people in their early twenties used to have mortgages, marriages, and children to take care of. Things have changed in ways beyond my generation’s control, but it’s still embarrassing that some now think that a $300 monthly payment constitutes a crisis, and that the government needs to save them. Maybe millennials need to realize that they can’t afford to live in expensive cities, and that paying one’s debts should come before planning your next vacation.
In his recent book, “The Vanishing American Adult,” Sen. Ben Sasse wrote that “Letting the next generation believe someone else will solve their problems imperils not only them but our whole society.” Well-intentioned politicians might want to provide a solution for student loans, but millennials won’t start making smart decisions unless they have to foot the bill for their own education. Unfortunately, no bailout or special program can save students suffering from a lack of responsibility.",['struggle']
"Major League Baseball is using its financial muscle to support the U.S. women's softball team, which already is assured a spot in the Tokyo Olympics while the American men's baseball team struggles to qualify.",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/major-league-baseball-to-sponsor-us-olympic-softball-team,fox-news,sport,right,42.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Major League Baseball is using its financial muscle to support the U.S. women's softball team, which already is assured a spot in the Tokyo Olympics while the American men's baseball team struggles to qualify.
MLB announced an agreement Thursday to become presenting sponsor of the women's ""Stand Beside Her"" tour, a slate of exhibition games leading up to the Olympic tournament from July 22-28.
""We're both bat and ball sports. Even though we're not the same sport, there are so many similarities that you just can't ignore,"" said Kim Ng, MLB's senior vice president for baseball operations. ""It was important for us to make sure that they have this acknowledgment and recognition of their ability and their talent.""
Softball began as an Olympic sport for the 1996 Atlanta Games. The U.S. won gold medals in 1996, 2000 and 2004 with players that included Dot Richardson, Jennie Finch and Jessica Mendoza, then lost to Japan in the 2008 gold medal game.
Baseball and softball were dropped for the next two Olympics, then restored for this year, when the U.S. and Japan will be joined by Australia, Canada, Italy and Mexico for games in Fukushima and Yokohama but not Tokyo. The sports are likely to be dropped for 2024 in Paris but could return four years later in Los Angeles.
The U.S. men's baseball team stumbled in its first attempt to qualify, wasting a ninth-inning lead against Mexico in the final game of the Premier12 tournament in November and losing in the 10th. The U.S. has two more chances to join Israel, Japan, Mexico and South Korea in the Olympic field: an Americas tournament in Arizona from March 22-26 and a final tournament in Taiwan from April 1-5.
MLB is not allowing players on 40-man big league rosters to compete in qualifying, and few top pitching prospects were at the November tournament.
Softball has no such issues. The Olympics are the sport's highest-profile event.
""The platform for us is 10 times bigger,"" American outfielder Haylie McCleney said. ""For us, it's a great opportunity for people that have never watched softball before, people that have only followed it at the collegiate level, to really see how fun our game is to watch, how pure it is. If people are baseball fans, I guarantee they're going to love softball because it's pretty much just a faster game — it's shorter, it's quicker, it's more entertaining to watch, in my opinion.""
The 2008 gold medal softball game took 1 hours, 45 minutes — less than half the 3:45 average for this year's World Series.
As part of the deal with MLB, the softball team's official training facility will be at the Jackie Robinson Training Complex in Vero Beach, Florida, the old Dodgertown spring training camp.
MLB Network will include programming from the tour, which currently starts Feb. 4 in Tampa, Florida, and has about three dozen stops.
The U.S. women's soccer team has attracted huge television audiences. MLB sees softball as an opportunity for the sport's growth.
""These are world-class athletes,"" Ng said. ""Because we have not been in the Olympics for the last 12 years, they just haven't had that stage. So it's really important at this point that we show as much support as we can for them.""","['financial', 'muscle', 'struggles']"
Six Republican Senators have failed to develop a coalition for their plan that exchanges a fifth of border wall funding for an amnesty for illegal aliens and increased immigration.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/11/gop-plan-for-daca-amnesty-increased-immigration-fails-amid-public-pressure/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,immigration,right,43.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Six Republican Senators have failed to develop a coalition for their plan that exchanges a fifth of border wall funding for an amnesty for illegal aliens and increased immigration.
The plan, described to Breitbart News, was a creation of Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Susan Collins (R-ME), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and would have tied $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall to an amnesty for illegal aliens enrolled and eligible in President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Also included in the plan was a provision to provide amnesty to foreign nationals who are in the United States as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries. The amnesty would have been rewarded to anywhere between 1.2 and 3.5 million DACA-enrolled and DACA-eligible illegal aliens, as well as the roughly 325,000 TPS foreign nationals.
The GOP Senators’ plan would have additionally increased the number of non-agricultural foreign workers that U.S. companies can import to take blue-collar American jobs. Already, the H-2B program gives business 66,000 cheap foreign workers every year.
In statements to the media, Graham said the plan had failed to come to fruition and garner support:
Sen GRAHAM says efforts to find a compromise path to reopen the government aren’t working: “I see no path forward…” — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) January 10, 2019
GRAHAM: “I’m done.” Q: So you’re saying there are no more conversations happening on finding a compromise? GRAHAM: “I don’t know who to talk to and I don’t know what else to do.” — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) January 10, 2019
As Breitbart News most recently reported, blue-collar Americans in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, construction industry, and fishing jobs have had their wages dragged down by foreign workers imported through the H-2B visa program.
The DACA amnesty-for-wall funding plan is despised by Trump’s most loyal supporters who have warned the administration against caving to the big business lobby and billionaire donor class, both of which have pushed for an amnesty for illegal aliens for the last two years.
Supporters of Trump had told Breitbart News that a DACA amnesty would nullify a border wall.
“Any support of DACA amnesty, before, after or during construction of a border wall is a betrayal to his campaign promises,” ALIPAC President and activist William Gheen said before the amnesty deal fell apart.
The ‘Amnesty First’ Trap: Trump Supporters Concerned Trade to End Shutdown Would Cause Illegal Immigration Surgehttps://t.co/X7IXb7kdMX — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) January 8, 2019
The plan came as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with the billionaire Koch brothers, have urged Republicans, Democrats, and Trump to pass an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens.
Corporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amnesty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.
A DACA amnesty would put more U.S.-born children of illegal aliens — commonly known as “anchor babies” — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with a $26 billion bill.
Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.
The chain migration inflow from a DACA amnesty has the potential to reach nine million foreign nationals arriving in the country, as every two newly naturalized citizens bring about seven foreign relatives to the U.S. with them. This is possibly nine million additional foreign nationals who would be admitted to the country, in addition to the 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants that arrive annually.

Biden made the apocalyptic pronouncement while discussing climate change before a crowd of supporters in Peterborough, New Hampshire.
“If we don’t stop using fossil fuels–” an attendee began a question to the candidate.
“We’re all dead,” Biden interrupted.
Earlier in the event, Biden vowed as president to hold energy giants liable for global warming and made a pledge to even jail executives.
“We have to set sort of guide rails down now, so between the years 2021 and 2030, it’s irreversible – the path we set ourselves on. And one of which is doing away with any substance for fossil fuels – number one,” Biden said.

“Number two, holding them liable for what they have done,” he said of fossil fuel executives, “particularly in those cases where your underserved neighborhoods and – you know the deal, okay. And by the way, when they don’t want to deliver, put them in jail. I’m not joking about this.”
It is unclear whether Biden meant he would also imprison his own son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of directors of Ukrainian gas giant Burisma Holdings between 2014-2016. The younger Biden was reportedly paid up to $83,000 as a Burisma board member, despite having no expertise in the energy sector.
Sunday’s remarks weren’t the first in which Biden advocated jailing business people. During June’s DNC debate, the former vice president called for insurance executives to be jailed for what he described as false advertising practices.
In September, Biden received blowback for attending a fundraiser hosted by a fossil fuel company co-founder — Andrew Goldman of Western LNG — after pledging not to accept contributions from the fossil fuel industry.",['apocalyptic']
"But Americans who blame anti-vaccination parents and propaganda have it wrong. Yes, those who do not vaccinate their children play a role in our failing rates, and lies about vaccinations causing autism have made matters worse, but there are less known, more significant causes to poor completion rates in children. ",https://thefederalist.com/2017/07/26/blame-money-not-anti-vaxxers-americas-low-child-vaccination-rates/,federalist,vaccines,right,43.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The number of recommended vaccines has increased from 10 doses in 1983 to almost 30 doses in 2015—each with an individual monetary and time cost for parents.
It is widely agreed upon in health care that immunizations are the second greatest advancement in public health—only behind clean drinking water. However, despite the known success of vaccines in reducing morbidity and mortality, immunization rates remain relatively low across the United States, especially in the 19- to 35-month age range.
But Americans who blame anti-vaccination parents and propaganda have it wrong. Yes, those who do not vaccinate their children play a role in our failing rates, and lies about vaccinations causing autism have made matters worse, but there are less known, more significant causes to poor completion rates in children. Those are primarily time and money. Low immunization rates are the result of a misaligned financial incentive structure for vaccination providers transferred to parents.
19 Shots Is a Lot to Pay For
Parents have a lot of choices to make. There are cost-benefit analyses to be done that include weighing vaccination risks such as allergies, as well as an intensifying mistrust of the traditional institutions in the United States. But there is also a growing need to recognize that as the world globalizes, travel increases, and bacteria evolve, herd immunity is vital for children’s safety.
Sadly, this has become more difficult as the number of recommended vaccines has increased from 10 doses in 1983 to almost 30 doses in 2015—each with an individual monetary and time cost for parents. For example, the conventional model for dispensing vaccines includes: four DTap, three polio, one MMR, three Hib, three Hep B, one varicella, and four PCV (4:3:1:3:3:1:4), for a total of 19 antigens being administered. Using traditional, monovalent vaccines, these 19 antigens are administered via 19 separate shots, and thus 19 separate fees.
Unfortunately, as the number of recommended childhood vaccines has nearly tripled, the likelihood of on-time and successful completion of vaccination series is reduced. Further, families living below the poverty line are less likely to complete their vaccination series due to the added financial and time constraints.
So, Combine the Vaccines
This begs the question, why don’t doctors use combination vaccines? Combination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and merge them into one shot. The sad answer is that doctors are not financially incentivized to. Vaccinations make doctors almost no money, and therefore the more shots they give, the more money they make. This is the exact problem health care faces in so many areas that reimburse using a fee-for-service model. It is also a barrier to achieving higher vaccination rates.
Although the Affordable Care Act attempted to address the issue of misaligned payments by increasing primary care Medicaid vaccine reimbursements, both Medicaid and private insurance still make earnings for doctors who administer vaccinations almost impossible. For example, reimbursement for Medicaid vaccine administration varies by state, but it’s as low as $2 in some states, often leaving providers with a net loss for administering a shot. Further, study findings note that 10 percent of family physicians already do not give vaccines to children, and another 10 percent are seriously considering discontinuing childhood vaccination because of costs.
At present, using combination vaccines, the recommended antigens for children could be administered in as few as 13 shots, saving parents lots of time and money. However, because doctors would lose even more money administering fewer vaccinations, there is no reason to make parent’s lives easier.
The saddest part of the misalignment of incentives is that children are the ones who suffer. Low reimbursements mean doctors’ lives have more difficulty making ends meet while doing their jobs, and parents’ lives are made harder by trying to stick to the government-proposed (and sometimes mandated) schedule at higher costs.
Using combination vaccines has been endorsed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as a safe and efficacious way to decrease the number of injections needed to complete the childhood immunization schedule. Additionally, combination vaccines have been shown to enhance immunization rates and timeliness of vaccine delivery.
As such, the CDC, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommend children receive combination vaccines whenever possible to improve completed vaccination series rates for children. It’s time to recognize the significant and detrimental role monovalent shots are having on America’s youth, and properly incentivize doctors—and parents—to vaccinate children to the best of their ability.","['anti-vaccination', 'lies', 'propaganda', 'wrong']"

Yesterday, one of presidential contender Bernie Sanders’ campaign lackeys tweeted out what should surely be considered one of the worst ideas of this election cycle.
This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before.
For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research.
However, according to publicly available data, associate professors at Fordham make an average of $111,700 per year. This excludes the value of their benefits, so final compensation is a good bit higher. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of professors at Fordham fall into the “associate professor” or “professor” category (full professors make, on average, $159,800 annually). So, 486 of Fordham professors fall into these well-paid and elite categories, while 224 fall into non-six-figures categories (assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer titles).
In other words, living in New York City and making a hefty wad of cash each year isn’t so oppressive, and the majority of Gautney’s colleagues are doing alright. That aside, Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.

Sanders’ Grand Plan
Still, plenty of other people have greeted the Sanders plan with fanfare. If elected, Sanders would have taxpayers pay off the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans. According to Washington Post, he’s “proposing to pay for the legislation with a new tax on financial transactions, including a 0.5 percent tax on stock transactions and a 0.1 percent tax on bonds,” which is a terrible idea in and of itself, as it would disincentivize investing.
What Bernie isn’t proposing to fix is the convergence of factors that lead to the high cost of college. Bailing people out instead of fixing deeper problems would be a foolish mistake. Colleges pump up their endowments and create bloated administrations, then expect students to grapple with enormous price tags.
But things don’t need to be like this: Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University in Indiana, has frozen tuition at 2012 rates, so incoming freshmen in 2019 are locked into these cheaper prices. Currently, per Forbes, “In inflation-adjusted dollars, Purdue costs $4,000 less per year for out-of-state students than it did when [Daniels] took the job in 2013. In-staters pay nearly $3,000 less, at just under $23,000 this academic year for tuition, room, board and expenses.”
Daniels’ plan hasn’t been free of controversy, but it does make more sense than the current system:
In 2016 he introduced income-share agreements. Students who exhaust federal loans can fund their education with an agreement to sign over a share of their future income, usually between 3% and 5% for up to ten years after they graduate. (Repayments are capped at 2.5 times initial costs.) Critics hate ISAs because they’re unregulated and untested. Milton Friedman is said to have invented the idea but famously noted that they were ‘economically equivalent … to partial slavery.’ Daniels says, ‘If you want indentured servitude, it’s the student-loan program. With ISAs, the risk shifts entirely to the lender,’ since grads who don’t find work pay nothing.
Innovative practices aside, it’s up to consumers to exert pressure on colleges and hold them accountable for such wasteful, bordering on deceitful, practices. There’s no real reason why tuition costs must keep climbing.
Federal Spending Makes Student Costs Way Worse
We can’t pretend federally-subsidized loans don’t play a massive role. Even left-leaning outlets like Slate acknowledge this basic truth, drawing on data published in 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Brigham Young University:
Looking at both public and private nonprofit colleges during the mid-2000s, they found that schools raised tuition by 55 cents for each $1 increase in Pell grants their undergraduates received, and by 60 to 70 cents for each extra dollar of subsidized student loans. Why would this happen? As the Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal points out, the answer is a little less obvious than you might assume—in a world of rational econo-bots, people aren’t supposed to willingly pay more for an investment, such as a college degree, just because they can get a loan for it.* But the reality is that there are still lots of 18-year-olds who will pay more or less whatever it takes to attend the college of their choice so long as they can find the cash. By letting students borrow more, the government may just be inviting schools to raise tuition, knowing kids simply respond by taking on extra debt.
Still, even with the widespread availability of such subsidized loans, the college debt crisis isn’t necessarily as bad as many claim, which is sure to be unpopular to those who feel like their burden is unjust. Reason’s Nick Gillespie writes, “According to data from Lending Tree, for instance, about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans; their median monthly payment was $222. The average loan amount (which will be higher than the median) for graduates with debt was about $30,000.”
The debt load for those who pursue law or medical school will undoubtedly be higher, and might be stacked on top of existing debt incurred by undergraduate degrees. Still, those who pursue careers in legal or medical fields can look forward to massive returns; in these circumstances, there’s no real need for debt to be forgiven since this is the cost of entry into an ultimately higher-paying field.
For those who pursue advanced degrees out of boredom or difficulty getting a job, with no clearly mapped-out ROI, that debt should also not be forgiven. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects.
College Admissions Counselors Have Bad Incentives
Then there are the social and cultural factors to consider: we currently have a system where college admissions counselors for high school students have no real skin in the game. If anything, their incentives are completely misaligned, even diametrically opposed, to the incentives of the students they’re supposedly helping. We should push back on this completely idiotic system we’ve created.
Parents and admissions counselors need to recognize that a small dose of tough love now will pay dividends later on. No student should bank on populist election-year whims bailing him out. Instead, parents and college counselors ought to have frank conversations with the students they’re shepherding into adulthood about fiscal responsibility and how student loan payments will factor into these students’ monthly budgets later in life.
There’s also the practical financial component: canceling debt would take $1.6 trillion. The money for this program, and the many others being proposed by the likes of Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, cannot be gotten from taxing just, say, millionaires over a certain threshold—especially since we’re hitting up those millionaire purses for every other thing on the agenda.
You can’t spend the same money twice, although every single Democratic presidential contender seems to be fruitlessly trying. So in order to have this scale of college debt bailout, we would need to tax significant swaths of the population, including a good number of middle- and upper-middle class earners. This sends a very clear message: we care about making the loads of relatively well-off students with decent financial prospects a bit lighter instead of helping much poorer Americans with fewer prospects.
That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).
""If we #CancelStudentDebt everybody can afford to go to college!"" Umm… *You* wanted to go to college. Others balk at the idea of 4+ years studying topics that bore them. They prefer the trades and starting businesses. Pay for your own preferences. — J.D. Tuccille (@JD_Tuccille) June 25, 2019
Even if all these other points are uncompelling to some, there’s a bigger, broader lesson to be learned here: why are we inviting more intrusion of other people into our personal lives? I think Gautney’s professional choices are foolish; they’re different than the ones I would make. The only reason I’m mentioning that is because she’s asked me, or people richer than me, to pay for these choices. Had she not, I’d have nothing to say about her career decisions.
The less intrusion into our private choices, the better, both for personal freedom and for creating a cohesive society that doesn’t feel it’s appropriate to cast judgment on the lifestyles other people choose to live. Feeling like we have to pay for other people’s foolish choices just breeds resentment, whether that resentment is warranted or not. So, the cost of this proposal is even higher than the already-flabbergasting $1.6 trillion.","['bad', 'naturally', 'appealing', 'ruinous']"

“I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world. … We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and then we take her baby. … Then we take her milk and put it in our coffee and our cereal,” Phoenix said. “I think we fear the idea of personal change, because we think we have to sacrifice something, to give something up. But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious, I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.”
In January, Phoenix was arrested at a “climate change” protest led by actress Jane Fonda in Washington, D.C. He invited Americans to stop consuming animal products to combat “climate change.”
Phoenix claimed, “The meat and dairy industry its the third leading cause of climate change and I think sometimes we wonder what can we do in this fight against climate change, and there’s something you can do today, right now, and tomorrow by making a choice about what you consume.”
Despite framing consumption of fossil fuels as a driver of “climate change,” Phoenix admitted to having flown to join the protest in the nation’s capital. The event’s organizers endorsed the Green New Deal, calling for an end to use of fossil fuels.
Other left-wing narratives pushed by Phoenix include critiques of the entertainment industry’s “systemic racism” and “gender inequality.”
Hollywood celebrities have procured speechwriting services from agencies run by political operatives who previously worked for Democrat figureheads such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, according to a February-published report.

Practicing pro-life litigators know that Trump judges are saving lives by permitting restrictions on abortion to go into effect.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/24/david-french-needs-to-stop-slandering-trump-supporting-christians/,federalist,abortion,right,43.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"David French remains very disappointed that many of his fellow evangelicals support President Donald Trump. He has used the Wuhan virus pandemic to reiterate and expand his arguments against the president’s character and competence (spoiler: He still thinks Trump is too wicked and incompetent for Christians to vote for him).
But he ignores that evangelical support for Trump, warts and all, is justified by principles French has urged on us — namely, that ours is not a Christian nation and that our political leaders do not have to be representatives for our faith.
White Evangelicals long ago gave up on the character test. Now, as tens of thousands of Americans die and the economy crashes in a foreseeable crisis Trump spent weeks minimizing, they've abandoned the competence test as well: https://t.co/33jGQBpQnE — David French (@DavidAFrench) April 19, 2020
After all, French was behind “Evangelicals for Mitt” and spent years arguing that our political leaders need not be avatars for our beliefs. More recently, in his debates with Sohrab Ahmari and others, he has asserted that America is a “permanently pluralistic nation,” meaning not a covenant Christian nation, but a classical liberal one, with evangelical Christians representing only one faction among many. The coalitional nature of politics in a pluralistic nation means Christians are free to support non-Christian politicians who will advance our interests, protect our rights, and govern better than the alternatives.
Of course, French has attempted to qualify this conclusion by arguing that Christians still have an absolute duty to vote for candidates of good character and presumed competence. Thus, he found Mitt Romney acceptable, but not Trump. But French has failed to establish, either by scripture or reason, such a duty, let alone measures by which to determine disqualifying levels of bad character and incompetence in a candidate.
This task, of course, is impossible, for judgments regarding worldly character and competence are comparative and relative to historical contingencies. Discerning them is the task of prudence. Thus, French has slandered his Christian brothers and sisters by writing, “Many millions of Trump-supporting white Evangelicals no longer care about character.” Perhaps that is true for some, but most of us still believe character is important, just not that it is dispositive.
French Makes Principles out of His Judgments
Christians may prefer political leaders of good character while recognizing that sometimes a bad man may be the best we can do. It is easy to find instances in which morally compromised politicians were nonetheless good leaders for their time, or in which they were worth supporting over a worse alternative (e.g., vote for the crook, it’s important). From the War for Independence to the civil rights movement, many of our national heroes have also had deep moral failings.
Character matters, but evaluating it and its importance in a particular political situation may be challenging even for the wise. In difficult cases, we may take comfort in the truth that our political leaders are not avatars for our religion.
Unfortunately, French has sought to make an absolute principle out of his prudential judgments regarding Trump, which has led him to be uncharitable and ungracious toward those of us whose judgments diverge from his. That we do not find the president’s many moral defects intrinsically disqualifying does not mean we believe character doesn’t matter, only that other considerations matter more in our current circumstances.
It is against these considerations that French’s charges of incompetence are directed. He says, “Trump’s impact on the welfare of the American city is increasingly clear. It’s more division. It’s more hate. It’s more incompetence. And now that terrible combination has yielded a series of dreadful errors in the face of a deadly pandemic.” Even if we set character aside, French argues Trump is too dangerously incompetent for us to support his reelection.
Plenty of Blame to Go Around DC
French is certainly correct that Trump made mistakes in responding to the coronavirus; some of his tweets were particularly foolish and will be used against him. But French’s indictment of Trump would be more convincing were there not such an abundance of blame to go around. It is not obvious that a different president would have produced very different results.
The greatest failure of the federal response was the testing debacle overseen by the experts at the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. Many Democrats and their media allies were no more on top of the developing crisis than the president, and even denounced his initial travel restrictions.
Furthermore, local and state authorities have control of much of the pandemic response, including lockdowns, which means they bear much of the responsibility, regardless of ill-advised presidential tweets. Among the nations with more COVID-19 deaths per capita than the United States are Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Switzerland.
The attempt to present Trump’s coronavirus response as uniquely incompetent is another example of our leadership class struggling to condemn Trump while excusing itself. Did Trump’s tweets make the Swiss incompetent?
Trump’s rise is the product of elite failures: moral, political, and cultural. For instance, this pandemic has demonstrated the folly of the expert consensus regarding our relations with China. More trade with the Chinese communists did not bring political liberalism to China, but it did empower a ruthless geopolitical enemy and eviscerate essential parts of the American economy — as we are relearning, “Made in the USA” matters.
Character Isn’t the Only Consideration
As for French’s insistence that evangelicals must vote for a generally competent candidate, competence is contextual, so we must ask: competence in and for what? President Trump has been very competent at some of his duties, such as not entangling the United States in new endless wars, and nominating qualified originalists to the federal bench. Whether these outweigh his incompetence elsewhere is a prudential judgment that must take account of circumstances and reasonable alternatives.
But French wants to make his prudential disagreements with his fellow evangelicals into matters of principle. Consequently, he claims they have “abandoned” or “no longer care about” character and competence in politicians.
This is not true. We may recognize the president’s flaws and regret that they make his administration less effective than we would like, yet still support him as a better option than either the Democratic alternative or a protest vote. Character matters, but so do many other things, and we may accept a politician of low character to attain them.
French’s efforts to counter this point are borderline disingenuous. For instance, regarding the judges Trump has appointed, he writes, “They might issue rulings that marginally protect life (though the pro-life battle is fought far more in the culture and in the states than in the courts).” But as French knows, those state battles often run through federal counts. In fact, he made that abundantly clear in his legalistic posturing against Ahmari’s cultural focus.
In many states, we have the votes to restrict or even abolish the extreme abortion regime the Supreme Court imposed on the entire nation. The main obstacle to our progress is the judiciary; if the federal courts are controlled by Democrat appointees who enforce a legal regime of abortion on demand, our efforts in statehouses across the nation will be stymied. Practicing pro-life litigators know that Trump judges are saving lives by permitting restrictions on abortion to go into effect.
If French finds this and other accomplishments of the Trump administration insufficient reason to vote for the president’s reelection, that is a point for reasonable debate. But his assertion that support for the president is a violation of Christian principle, rather than an error of prudential judgment, is undercut by his own political theory.
For years, he has told us our political leaders are not representative of our faith and that ours is not a covenant Christian nation, but a permanently pluralistic state in which we are but one faction among many. Very well, then: we will vote like it.","['pro-life', 'saving']"
"Next came the sob stories. Those student loans are suffocating a generation, the candidates suggested. After all, “40 million of us who can’t start a family,” the diaper-changing daddy Swalwell contradictorily proclaimed, adding that they “Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/15/student-debt-willingly-took-not-problem-solve/,federalist,student-debt,right,43.0,3.0,Biased,No agreement,"Of all the pandering showcased during Democrats’ attempts to win back the presidency, wiping out student debt ranked at or near the top.
“I believe that education is the future for this country,” socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders barked during the first round of Democratic primary debates, explaining that’s why we must “eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.” Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke similarly. “I can tell you this,” the Minnesota senator demagogued, “if billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.”
There can be no serious discussion of this issue, however, in 60-second sound bites. So, beyond the soak-the-rich shtick that shades every Democratic economic debate point, the candidates resorted to two tactics: shock and sob stories.
The Shock Strategy
The size of student debt provides the jolt necessary to peddle their plans to the American populace. “I got $100,000 in student loan debt myself,” California Rep. Eric Swalwell bemoaned. “College affordability is personal for us,” South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared, noting that his household has “six-figure student debt.” So, sure, “I believe in reducing student debt,” Buttigieg announced.
Next came the sob stories. Those student loans are suffocating a generation, the candidates suggested. After all, “40 million of us who can’t start a family,” the diaper-changing daddy Swalwell contradictorily proclaimed, adding that they “Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.”
“We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on,” frontrunner Joe Biden agreed.
Tellingly, when not constrained by the debate format, these same politicians push the same narrative to garner support for bailing out student loans, all while the media provides the Democrats a free assist.
“With loans totaling more than $130,000,” Buttigieg’s household is “among the 43 million people in the United States who owe federal student loan debt,” the Associated Press reported last month, before highlighting the myriad plans to bail out student debt pushed by a cadre of presidential candidates. The AP then furthered the narrative by using statistics to shock the public into socialism:
The debtors are so numerous and the total debt so high—more than $1.447 trillion, according to federal statistics—that several of the Democratic candidates have made major policy proposals to address the crisis. Their ideas include wiping away debt, lowering interest rates, expanding programs that tie repayment terms to income and making college free or debt-free. Student loan debt is often discussed as an issue that mostly affects millennials, but it cuts across age groups. Federal statistics show that about 7.8 million people age 50 and older owe a combined $291.9 billion in student loans. People age 35 to 49, a group that covers older millennials such as Buttigieg as well as Generation X, owe $548.4 billion. That group includes more than 14 million people.
Sob Stories Reign Supreme
Then the sad tales continue the sales pitch for a government solution to student debt—a ploy that began well before the 2016 elections. Here’s one of myriad media examples.
“Shayna Pilnick, 28, would like to buy an apartment but can’t afford a mortgage. Jacqueline Mannino, 23, and her boyfriend, Benjamin Prowse, 26, want to get married. Jacob Childerson, 24, and his wife, Jennifer, 25, wish they could start a family, but they live with Jennifer’s parents,” is how USA Today opened its 2013 profile of millennials unable to obtain their dream life because they are “tethered” to “tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt.”
There are many ways to counter these arguments, based on both economics and equity. But it’s hard to counter soundbites with sense, so instead, here are my inquiries for these politicians, the press, and all the students demanding relief from the burdens of their debt: Tell me your sob stories from age 12 on, not what you can’t do now, but what you couldn’t do then. Tell what you had to do then and through college to avoid what is now, to you, crushing student debt.
What time did you get up to deliver papers in junior high? How many hours a week did you work since 14 to save for college? How many toilets did you scrub? How many high school football games did you miss because you were working? What dream college did you forgo to avoid taking out student loans?
Which 8 a.m. class did you take so you could complete your major’s requirements and still work in the afternoon? Which bus line did you take to get to your job because you didn’t borrow to buy a car? What job did you work full-time while completing your MBA at night?
What did you do to afford college? What didn’t you do because of the cost of college? Were you getting tattoos and traveling your way through college? Were you pledging and partying? Did you go to your top-choice university? Maybe an out-of-state public university with higher tuition rates? Which spring break and study abroad destinations did you visit along the way?
Did you splurge on your fairytale wedding instead of paying down your student loans? What cars did you buy or lease? Where did you live? What electronics did you own? What clothing and other personal expenditures did you have? In short, show me the money and how you spent it!
None of my business? You’re right. Nor is your student debt my business or my problem.","['sob', 'stories', 'diaper-changing', 'daddy', 'suffocating', 'contradictorily']"
"For our friends on the Left, Trump’s refusal to wear a mask is irresponsible toxic masculinity that is sending the wrong message and getting people killed, even though Dr. Deborah Brix has explained it’s not much of a risk. Biden, meanwhile, to their minds is leading by example by wearing his mask even when there is no good reason he should.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/26/the-mask-is-now-the-political-symbol-of-2020/,federalist,elections-2020,right,43.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"Welcome to the election of the mask, choose your side wisely.
Now that most of America has begun opening back up without the predicted spikes in coronavirus and Joe Biden has left his basement bunker, Americans are remembering that there’s an election going on. As normalcy quickly returns some places, so to has the battle for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
The Chinese virus has left a symbolic mark on the race. The facemask has emerged not just as an issue on the trail, but also as a signal as to one’s likely political leanings.
Donald Trump has taken heat for mostly refusing to mask up while performing his duties. This left the Biden camp with a choice to make when Joe woke up from political hibernation, and they went all in. Now it’s Joe getting into a car in a mask, Joe at a monument in a mask, Joe being interviewed in a mask, and in many cases he is socially distancing while wearing it, which the CDC does not advise.
New York Gov. Cuomo chimed in on the ubiquitous chinstraps saying that they have become, “Almost a point of cultural communication. Wearing a mask now is cool.” He joked about signing an executive order making masks cool.
He’s been making a lot of jokes recently as the Empire State crumbles, but this one had a germ of truth in it. The mask, especially in socially distanced situations is not about science anymore, it’s about signaling that the virus is too dangerous for our lives to return to normal. It sends the message that the pliant wearer will do as they are told and entitles them to heap scorn on those who won’t. Not surprisingly this often breaks down on party lines.
To be clear, almost nobody, including the president thinks that masks have no role to play as we reopen the economy. It makes sense to wear one in close space where you can’t be six feet apart, here in Brooklyn, an epicenter of the virus most people, myself included usually do that. But when walking down the street, or sitting on a park bench there is little reason to believe masks have much efficacy.
For our friends on the Left, Trump’s refusal to wear a mask is irresponsible toxic masculinity that is sending the wrong message and getting people killed, even though Dr. Deborah Brix has explained it’s not much of a risk. Biden, meanwhile, to their minds is leading by example by wearing his mask even when there is no good reason he should.
When you set aside the names of the politicians and parties, the divide that is revealed has most to do with how much control people want the government to have over their lives. Progressives are clear that their answer is a whole lot. From the Green New Deal to “Medicare for All,” banning guns, and now even to surveillance in the case of things like contact tracing, they invite a state that leaves individuals with far less choice and freedom.
One way to describe societies that decide to scrub away individual liberty is faceless; people are identical cogs without unique features. Here we move from the symbolic to the literal as people hide their faces from the world. The most important thing about these people is now that piece of fabric and the compliance it indicates. There will be no smiling.
Joe Biden and the Democrats are the party of the mask, the party of government power and intervention. For them the Chinese virus is an opportunity to seize, as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio put it, to create a new New Deal. Ultimately this election may now come down to a fight between Americans who want to return almost fully to life as it was, and those who seek a less free “new normal.”
This point might be made as forcefully as the Democrats doing a Zoom convention where Nancy Pelosi gives a speech in front of her fancy fridge and a GOP that trips the light fantastic in a rock’em, sock’em in-person live rally event. Should that occur, the contrast could not help but frame the contest. This is the election of the mask, and its just about time to choose your side.","['irresponsible', 'toxic', 'masculinity', 'wrong']"
"It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/americans-need-to-stop-hurrying-young-people-into-student-debt-slavery/,federalist,student-debt,right,43.0,3.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt.
Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt.
Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis.
Debt forgiveness plans like Sens. Elizabeth Warren’s and Bernie Sanders’s will encourage colleges to increase their already pricey tuitions. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. We need to help students before they’re drowning in debt.
These ideas don’t address the root problem. They assume that all 18-year-olds benefit from a college education. But this assumption is wrong. Many high schoolers don’t know what they want to do with their lives. Others enter college unprepared. Parents, teachers, and other leaders need to encourage alternative options for these students. These students are the least likely to get well-paid jobs that will allow them to repay their college loans. This will leave them in a terrible financial trap.
It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Underemployed graduates get stuck in such positions, drastically shrinking their lifetime earnings.
Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision. Thirty-three percent of students change majors and 10 percent switch majors multiple times, which prolongs the completion time and cost of a bachelor’s degree.
College also exacts a high cost from students who lack sufficient academic preparation. Between 40 and 60 percent of high school graduates are placed into remedial courses during their first year of college. Many of these students drop out and never earn bachelor’s degrees. College drop-outs earn far less on average and are almost four times more likely to default on student loans than college graduates. Defaulters destroy their credit scores and damage their borrowing ability for a house or a car.
Parents, teachers, and other leaders should carefully note these trends and consider tailoring their career advice to each student’s specific needs. Most American policymakers say all students should attend college, but that’s a bad recommendation for unsure and unprepared students. Alternative paths to success exist.
Students without direction should first discover their strengths and interests through internships, apprenticeships, volunteer positions, or directly entering the workforce. Ideally, they should earn money while they “find themselves,” not borrow money in pursuit of a college degree that may not benefit them. These students would profit from putting off college until they know how they want to use the education.
Some high school students know they aren’t interested in college. Policymakers should support these students by encouraging them to attend a vocational school or enter the workforce. Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it.
Some students want jobs that require a college degree, but aren’t prepared for the work. The worst choice they could make would be to spend or borrow money to attend college when they aren’t ready. These students should delay college enrollment until they are academically prepared. Students can study online, read books in public libraries, take remedial courses at community colleges—and, most importantly, work and earn money while they prepare.
Americans should, however, recommend students to attend college if they are ready and have a clear understanding of what they want to do with their education. Many lucrative careers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and these students should pursue college as soon as possible. But it’s not a good investment to encourage unprepared students to drift into debt slavery.
Policies that tighten loan eligibility requirements for college-bound students will discourage unprepared students from drifting into college. For example, federal student loan programs should be reformed to restrict eligibility to applicants with above-average high school GPAs and family incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. If we don’t, a whole generation of Americans will be sucked under.",['trap']
"Other than the fact that none of the above is even close to the truth and that the entire premise of the article is the fakest of fake news, the Daily Beast has a real bombshell on its hands.",https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/11/08/daily-beast-spreads-fake-news-white-nationalist-guest-white-house/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,44.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The far-left Daily Beast spread the fake news Wednesday that a “white nationalist” had been a guest at the White House.
After informing readers that the leader of “a white nationalist group … visited the White House on Wednesday,” the Daily Beast’s Asawin Suebsaeng and Will Sommer then claimed he had been a White House guest.
According to the Beast’s “three sources,” who are supposedly “familiar with how the Trump White House operates,” readers are told that the only way this white nationalist could have had his picture taken “directly in front of the White House’s south front” is if he had been “escorted by a Trump administration staffer wearing an official badge to get that kind of access.”
In other words, the only way this person could have been where he was is if he were an official guest at the White House.
Other than the fact that none of the above is even close to the truth and that the entire premise of the article is the fakest of fake news, the Daily Beast has a real bombshell on its hands.
The truth is that there was a Fall Garden Tour that allowed “more than twenty-five thousand people” access to this area of the White House, deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters told the Daily Beast in an email.
She added that this tour “is open to the public. Free tickets are made available to anyone who wants to attend.”
And here is where things get especially interesting….
In the original article, the Daily Beast reported that this “white nationalist” leader visited the White House on Wednesday. But here is the thing…
The Daily Beast had no idea when he visited, which is something these so-called reporters are forced to admit in their stealth rewrite of the original article.
Original story: “The leader of a white nationalist group whose members marched in the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville visited the White House on Wednesday, according to pictures he posted online.”
Stealth rewrite: “Though [the white nationalist’s] post was dated Wednesday, Walters’ explanation suggests that he visited the White House on either October 20 or 21, when the Fall Garden Tour was held.”
So based only on the date the photo was posted, without knowing if it were true, the Daily Beast told its readers that date was also the date of the visit, which, of course, fit a false narrative about triumphant racists celebrating Tuesday’s election results as guests of the White House.
Worse still…
Rather than do the correct thing–rather than issue a correction or retract the fake news–the article was stealthily edited with a massive rewrite. (You can compare the before and after here and here.)
At the bottom of the rewrite, an editor’s note reads, “This article has been updated with additional reporting,” which is not even close to true. The truth is that all of the fake news was secretly retracted and the article rewritten almost entirely.
It is also worth noting that the “white nationalist” in question, Patrick Casey, does not claim to be a white nationalist but an identitarian activist, a group the far-left media regularly attack as racist.
Finally, Will Sommer, the co-writer of this fake news deception and the subsequent cover-up, makes a living smearing right-leaning journalists as racists and liars, all in the hope of having them de-platformed, censored, and silenced. And if that means publishing this kind of fake news and then covering up his lies with a secret rewrite, so be it.

This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,44.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['gleefully', 'murders', 'democracy', 'crime']"
"Nevertheless, the media jihad continues, and that includes NBC shamelessly running a debunked and deceptive smear story that had been reported on and debunked all the way back in May.",https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2019/01/23/nbc-fake-news-covington-gay-valedictorian/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,44.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Far-left NBC News smeared Covington Catholic High School by spreading fake news about “Covington” banning of a gay valedictorian’s speech.
For five days now, the establishment media have relentlessly demonized a group of high school kids guilty of nothing more than behaving admirably in the face of taunts and bullying. On Saturday night, the media used selectively edited video and proven lies told by American Indian activist Nathan Phillips to falsely accuse MAGA hat-wearing kids — 16-year-olds from Covington Catholic High School — of ganging up on the activist.
Video proves the kids, who were waiting for their bus after the March for Life, had been minding their own business when a gang of adult black nationalists taunted them for the better part of an hour with racist and homophobic slurs. Then Phillips menaced and provoked the kids by invading their personal space while beating a drum.
The reaction from the Covington kids consisted only of admirable restraint, good humor, and a commitment to ensure things did not escalate.
Nevertheless, the media jihad continues, and that includes NBC shamelessly running a debunked and deceptive smear story that had been reported on and debunked all the way back in May.
NBC’s deliberately misleading headline reads: “Gay valedictorian banned from speaking at Covington graduation ‘not surprised’ by D.C. controversy.” The story accuses “Covington” (I’ll explain the quote marks in a bit) of “banning” a speech that was to be given by an openly gay student.
Here’s the fake news from NBC:
In May of last year, the Catholic diocese ruled just hours before Holy Cross High School’s graduation that the openly gay valedictorian [Christian Bales] and the student council president could not give their planned speeches at the Covington school’s official graduation ceremony. … Bales, now 19 and a freshman at the University of Louisville, spoke to NBC News on Tuesday about last year’s incident and the recent viral video that has dragged Covington back into the national spotlight. “I was not surprised at all,” Bales plainly told NBC News when asked for his reaction to last week’s D.C. confrontation. “It was only a matter of time that something this school community did would blow up to this degree, and I think they need to be held accountable.” Bales claims Covington Catholic is “notorious for being a not-well-disciplined school,” and he described the Diocese of Covington as “archaic.”
But…
According to USA Today’s original story, which ran in May, the openly gay Bales attended a Catholic school in “Covington,” and did so while wearing “makeup and bobby pins” — which sounds pretty tolerant to me. He went on to graduate as valedictorian but was not allowed to give a class speech for two reasons that had nothing to do with his homosexuality: 1) he turned the speech in late and 2) the speech was political.
Using a megaphone, Bales ended up giving his speech outside after the graduation ceremony without incident.
In the original USA Today piece, Bales doesn’t dispute turning his speech in late, and the text of speech (which is included in the story) proves it is highly political and divisive — which, of course, is highly inappropriate for a high school graduation.
What’s more, one of Bales’ classmates, who was also scheduled to give a speech and who is presumably not gay, was also told she could not give her speech due to it being “too personal,” which violated school policy.
And now I am going to lay out all the facts NBC News withheld in order to mislead their readers and further demonize a group of children who are guilty of nothing more than being well-behaved, white, Christian Trump supporters:
NBC News does not concede the fact that Bales submitted the speech late, instead framing it only as an allegation — an excuse from the diocese. Nowhere does NBC News reveal that Bales’ speech was a Parkland-inspired diatribe about gun control.
And now we come to my favorite part….
Are you ready for this…
Seriously, because this is a wowser…
Christian Bales was not a student at Covington High School. Christian Bales graduated from Holy Cross High School, a completely different high school. If his speech had been approved, he would have given it at Holy Cross High School, not at Covington High School. Holy Cross High is run by the same Catholic diocese as Covington High, but they are two completely different schools. NBC News bombards the story with more than a dozen references to “Covington” but goes out of its way to obscure the fact Bales attended a completely different school…
In May of last year, the Catholic diocese ruled just hours before Holy Cross High School’s graduation that the openly gay valedictorian and the student council president could not give their planned speeches at the Covington school’s official graduation ceremony.
See what NBC did there?
If NBC and the rest of the media are willing to lie this openly when the facts (and video) are right there for the world to see, imagine the lies being told using unnamed sources and the like.
And if the media are willing to destroy the lives of innocent children for political purposes, imagine what they are willing to do to the rest of us.

"Today’s mainstream media doesn’t want you to remember, but the early days of feminism were rife with ideological battles and  backstabbing that would put a medieval court to shame.",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/04/16/hulu-phyllis-schlafly-series-mrs-america-paints-feminists-as-shallow-backstabbers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,44.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Much has been and will be written about the way FX’s Mrs. America defiles and maligns the late Phyllis Schlafly, the iconic conservative activist and author who defeated the Equal Rights Amendment and gave conservative women a voice on the political stage. The limited series, whose first three episodes dropped this week on Hulu, has plenty of bile to go around. Surprisingly, it saves some of it for the radical feminists who are the show’s ostensible heroines.
Surprising because in its early trailer, Mrs. America sold itself as a celebration of second-wave feminism as it waged righteous war against the dark forces of the “patriarchy.” But as the early episodes show, the series feels little nostalgia for the heydey of Gloria Steinem, whom it portrays as vain and self-centered. As the pretty young face of the movement, Steinem (Rose Byrne) has few qualms about pushing aside first-wavers embodied by the frumpy Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman), who deeply resents being put out to pasture by her acolytes.
And in an episode reminiscent of Bernie Sanders, Mrs. America shows how feminists colluded with the Democrat establishment to throw presidential hopeful Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba) under the bus in order to prop up the more centrist George McGovern. Chisholm, the first black woman to run for the White House, feels the bern of betrayal. The fact that her so-called sisters are exclusively white only worsens the sting.
Today’s mainstream media doesn’t want you to remember, but the early days of feminism were rife with ideological battles and backstabbing that would put a medieval court to shame. Feminists fought among themselves over pornography, gay rights, and the role of minorities in the movement.
Mrs. America restores some of the warts even as it airbrushes others, resulting in a docu-fiction that is a bit less knee-jerk than you might expect from liberal Hollywood.
Of course, it’s a minor concession given how Mrs. America so blatantly stacks the deck against Phyllis Schlafly (Cate Blanchett), who so far comes off as a conniving ice queen and a walking anachronism — a devoted wife and mother of six who performs sit-ups at home in her pearls and admires how eagles mate for life.
In an early scene, the feminists receive a mailer of Schlafly’s soon-to-be-influential newsletter, which they carelessly toss aside. “Who the hell is Phyllis ‘Shaffley’?” one of them asks. The series plays Schlafly’s values for laughs, but it also observes how feminism’s arrogance and condescension toward middle American values was the movement’s biggest miscalculation.
It’s a lesson that many on the left still haven’t learned.
To be clear, though, this is part of a broader Schlafly-focused revisionist trend in Hollywood. Last year, Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel smeared Schlafly in its third season by having a character describe her as “racist and sexist,” while another character implied that she was anti-Semitic. In reality. Schlafly was pro-Israel and expressed admiration for Golda Meir.

"The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,45.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.

Ernst said that D.C. bureaucrats are “supposed to work for the American people– not the other way around.”

Sargent has written leftist pieces at the Washington Post for years. In March 2016, Sargent called then-candidate Donald Trump a “nightmare nominee,” saying that not even white men like Trump.
In March 2019, Sargent wrote that Trump is “likely emboldening hate groups through his rhetoric.”
The Post columnist asked in the wake of the New Zealand terrorist attack, “Are Trump’s words emboldening white nationalist and white supremacist activity at home and abroad?”
On Monday, Sargent said that the “we” should describe President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a new “Axis of Autocracy.”
“New revelations show Trump is embracing illiberal autocrats abroad while corrupting our democracy at home,” he added.

In response to Hawley’s criticisms, Sargent went to his blog Monday night to accuse Hawley of racialist dog-whistles.
Sargent claimed:
Hawley often rails at elites who, he claims, have contempt for the “great American middle,” because it’s supposedly at odds with the elite cosmopolitan “consensus” favoring globalization and immigration.
… Indeed, as Will Wilkinson notes, Hawley’s “great American middle” is in reality code, an effort to recast the minoritarian America of “nonurban whites” who fundamentally reject this country’s “multiracial, multicultural national character” as the American mainstream. This “great American middle” apparently does not include the large majorities who hold allegedly “elite” positions such as favoring the legalization of millions of undocumented immigrants and opposing further immigration restrictions.

Sen. Hawley said Monday night that the “liberal snobs” call living in Missouri a punishment, and they call Hawley a “secret racist” for “daring to disagree.”
“Then they wonder why the American middle feels disrespected,” he added.

It’s odd, isn’t it, that so many of the folks who warn us about the authoritarianism of the GOP also happen to support an array of policies that coerce Americans to do things they don’t want to?
Take, for example, the four reliably liberal Supreme Court justices, all of whom believe it’s OK to compel Americans to pay dues to political organizations they disagree with, to coerce them to say things they abhor, and to compel them to create things that undermine their principles.
For some, myself included, the prospects of a court run by people who ignore the Constitution was the best argument for Donald Trump in 2016. The question was, “What’s scarier, a Trump presidency or a progressive Supreme Court?” I imagine the answer is becoming a bit clearer for many conservatives.
In three cases this term — the rulings that stopped the Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission from destroying Jack Phillips’ business over a thought crime, California’s attempt to force people to support abortion, and public-sector unions from continuing their long-standing policy of forcing workers to fund their political activities — the court has handed the Constitution clear wins.
I mean, has there been a bigger win for small-government, real-life conservatives over the past few decades than the Janus v. AFSCME ruling? The decision not only fortifies the First Amendment by explicitly finding compelled speech unconstitutional, but also calls out the Left’s authoritarian political machinery, which has been holding many American communities, school systems, and workers hostage for decades.
“It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority. “Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.”
The Janus ruling also stipulates that employees must now affirmatively opt-in — rather than having to opt out — of unions before having to pay fees. The court understood that dollars are fungible, and every one of them should be considered a matter of speech.
Certainly, it would not have been the case had Hillary won. We know this by taking a peek at a counterhistory offered by reading the liberal dissents.
“The First Amendment,” writes Justice Elena Kagan, “was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance — including over the role of public-sector unions.” The idea that the court should decide who deserves First Amendment protections, or that those protections should be contingent on the vagaries of “democratic governance,” whatever that means, is as corrupt as any of the dumb things Trump has ever said about free expression. The Supreme Court is built to withstand the whims of democracy, of majoritarianism, not to surrender to them. (Then again, Kagan gives away her political game when she worries that “Public employee unions will lose a secure source of financial support.”)
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, accused the majority of weaponizing the First Amendment — an unconscionable position for a person tasked with “faithfully and impartially” discharging the duty to protect the inherent rights of all Americans. The dissenters have perverted the intent of the Founders. It’s none of Sotomayor’s business how we use free expression. It’s her business to protect it.
And in an environment where Americans are increasingly drifting apart ideologically, culturally, and politically on virtually every major issue, gridlock has become the de facto state of affairs in DC, and the court becomes even more important. Whatever Trump’s predilections or beliefs might be, to this point the First Amendment has been strengthened under this presidency.
Don’t get me wrong: Trump’s attacks on the press can be harmful and gratuitous (though, of course, not every tweet critical of CNN is an attack on the foundations of the First Amendment). Yet they are far less consequential than allowing SCOTUS to codify attacks on free expression.
Not that we should forget that we can thank Mitch McConnell for giving Trump the Neil Gorsuch seat. The much-disparaged Senate leader withstood immense political pressure and preposterous attacks when stopping President Obama from stacking the court.
But the president kept his word when it came to the Court. It’s still early in the Trump era, of course, and we really have no idea how the residual political effects of our acute partisan battles or investigations or ugly rhetoric or the often-incompetent presidency will manifest in the long term. Perhaps Trump’s unpopularity will make it harder for originalists to find their way to the Supreme Court in the future. Perhaps not. It’s also true that in no time in modern American history has a president’s disposition and rhetoric conflicted more dramatically with the outcomes of his administration. But that has been a net win for the Constitution.","['undermine', 'principles', 'reliably', 'compel', 'coerce', 'abhor', 'liberal']"

He said he knew what he needed but it was so darn expensive. Yes, it is, I said. He told me he needed to get it for his daughter, who was in town because she lost her job due to the coronavirus.
We parted ways and I just felt a pull to get a couple cans of formula for him, which I purchased, then went to find him. When I gave him the cans, he broke down in tears. He said he had been contemplating how to steal those cans because he’s on a fixed income and couldn’t afford the formula to help his daughter.
Then he embraced me. We didn’t have masks. There was no Centers for Disease Control-recommended distance between us at all.
All we had was our humanity. And that’s exactly what is being lost during this pandemic.

The poll asked voters if it would be a “good thing or a bad thing for the United States to move away from capitalism and more toward socialism.” Forty percent of Democrats said it would be a good thing, while only 34 percent said it would be a bad thing.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS FAVOR TAXING THE WEALTHY, INCREASING DOMESTIC SPENDING
Among all voters polled, 54 percent said a move toward socialism would be bad, with only 24 percent saying it would be good. Republicans were more united against the shift, with 80 percent saying socialism would be a bad move, and eight percent saying it would be good.
The poll also found that voters prefer increasing spending on domestic programs over cutting taxes and reducing spending, and their preferred way to finance that spending is by taxing the wealthy.
Other polls have shown a similar move left from not only Democrats, but Americans in general.
Back in 2010, 68 percent of young people, 18-29 years old, said they approved of capitalism, while 51 percent said they approved of socialism, according to Gallup. Fast-forward to August 2018, and that same age group backs socialism over capitalism, 51 percent to 45 percent.
AMERICANS WARMING TO SOCIALISM OVER CAPITALISM, POLLS SHOW
Democrats, meanwhile, were evenly split between capitalism and socialism back in 2010. But now, 57 percent say they hold a positive view of socialism, compared with just 47 percent who say the same for capitalism.
The poll is the latest sign of the party’s move to the left, particularly as a number of 2020 presidential hopefuls have embraced once-fringe policies such as Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal.
On Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced a new “wealth tax” proposal on Americans with more than $50 million in assets.
""We need structural change. That’s why I’m proposing something brand new – an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. I’m calling it the 'Ultra-Millionaire Tax' & it applies to that tippy top 0.1% – those with a net worth of over $50M,"" Warren, who sits on the left of her party, tweeted.

Rispone is crying foul about the race-baiting ads from Edwards’ allies.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/05/democrats-deploy-race-card-in-louisiana-governor-race/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,45.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Backers of Louisiana Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards are playing the race card against supporters of President Donald Trump, as the contest between Edwards and Republican Eddie Rispone heats up in the final week plus of the campaign.
Edwards’ allies are pushing a narrative that supporting Rispone is akin to being a racist like infamous white supremacist David Duke.
New radio ads launched this week by the Black Organization for Leadership Development (BOLD) urging people to vote against Rispone and for Edwards by claiming that Rispone and his highest-profile supporter President Trump are racists.
“Y’all remember that sickening feeling you got when you woke up and realized that Donald Trump was elected president? The nightmare is happening again—what is the difference between David Duke, Eddie Rispone and Donald Trump? The only difference is that Eddie Rispone will be governor if you do not stop him,” the BOLD ad narrator New Orleans City Councilman Jay Banks says in the ad.
“These people are telling you every day they do not care about you or anyone who looks like you,” Banks continues. “First it was the Muslims, then it was the Hispanics. Do you have any doubt what ‘Make America Great Again’ really means? Go and vote against hatred. Go and vote for your family and the people you care about. Go vote for John Bel Edwards.”
Edwards and Banks are particularly close allies. In fact, in 2017, Edwards went out of his way to publicly endorse Banks and praised him effusively.
“You all know what a quality individual he is and what a good job he will do in New Orleans, because, quite frankly, you may not think there’s much tie-in between the governor of the state of Louisiana and a district councilman in New Orleans,” Edwards said of Banks. “But the truth is, it takes teamwork at all levels. … I’m excited to be here and support Jay and his candidacy for Council here in New Orleans.”
This radio ad comes as door hangers making the same case—that Trump, Rispone, and their supporters are racists—have appeared throughout Louisiana in the black community.
The door hanger ads on one side show photoshopped pictures of Rispone, Trump, and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal collaged together with a photo of Duke. “Eddie Rispone stands with Donald Trump & David Duke,” text under the photoshopped collage reads. “Our turnout was under 38% in the primary. Vote early Nov 2 to Nov 9.”
On the book of the door hanger ad, it lists out several “facts” about Rispone—all of which are untrue.
The first one, which is obviously false because no governor could do this even if he wanted to and Rispone has not said any such thing, says that Rispone will if elected “take away your healthcare and freeze Medicaid enrollment.”
The second one falsely rips Rispone, a businessman before he decided to run for office, for having “failed to pay employees and refused to pay their medical bills.”
The next one falsely claims that Rispone would take away voters’ kids’ school lunches. “Eddie Rispone wants to eliminate free school lunches and food stamp assistance,” the ad claims. Again, no governor has the ability to do this—and these are federal programs anyway, so they come from Washington, D.C., not from the state of Louisiana.
Pro-Edwards yard signs touting that same lie on school lunches have popped up around Louisiana too, urging people to support the Democrat governor in order to “Save Our Kids School Lunch.”
It is unclear if Edwards’ campaign itself, or some other outside group like BOLD or another one supporting Edwards, rolled out these ads via door hanger and yard sign as they are unlabeled as to who is paying for them.
Rispone is crying foul about the race-baiting ads from Edwards’ allies. According to a report in the Advocate, a Louisiana newspaper, the GOP gubernatorial candidate called Edwards’ team’s race-baiting ads “disgusting” and ripped Edwards and his pals for “playing the race card again.”
“They’re comparing Donald Trump and me to David Duke, that’s how low they will stoop to win this race. It’s incredible,” Rispone said, adding: “Nothing could be further from the truth than me being a racist.”
Rispone has even launched radio ads of his own exposing the Edwards team’s exploitation of race to try to win the election.
“How desperate is liberal career politician John Bel Edwards?” a narrator says in the Rispone radio ad. “So desperate that instead of denouncing radical leftwing attacks on Eddie Rispone and Donald Trump, he’s relying on them. Just listen.”
Then the ad plays the entire Banks BOLD ad that Edwards is using to try to win.
﻿
“John Bel Edwards–too weak to stop these hateful attacks,” the narrator concludes. “Too cowardly to condemn them. John Bel Edwards, too liberal for Louisiana.”","['crying', 'foul', 'race-baiting', 'allies']"

This is not meant as a trick question, but it might be a little tricky. Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white.
There’s a complication, though. If whites can’t take pride in our ethnicity, is it okay for blacks or Hispanics to have ethnic pride? Our society looks on that kind of boosterism with a much more tolerant eye. What’s the difference? Have we so succumbed to the siren song of privilege theory that white people are the only ones left who are not allowed to feel good about ourselves?
That Damned ‘Invisible Backpack’
As David Marcus explained in this insightful essay, privilege theory is indeed a real problem. It helped re-awaken tribal loyalties that would have been better left shifting in their shallow graves. Everyone is better off when whites don’t think too much about their whiteness. It should be normal without being normative, and regular without being right. It’s having a one-story house. It’s writing in black pen. It’s Times New Roman.
Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman. They poked and they prodded, and eventually got the resentful backlash they were provoking. Privilege theory has done real damage, and white liberals should be assessing their mistakes. Nevertheless, it’s hard to believe that privilege theory is the only culprit.
When higher allegiances break down, lower ones become more prominent. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, and that involves finding reasons to align yourself with this group of people, instead of that other one. Group allegiances are not necessarily an excuse for hatred or bigotry (although they can give rise to those evils). They’re about belonging somewhere, and having people you can turn to when the road gets rocky. People need that.
It’s no secret that Trumpism and the alt-right have found their strongest footholds in places where social and economic breakdown are the worst. Family structures break down, church communities dwindle, the economy sags, and ethno-nationalism becomes more appealing.
Proud to Be a (White) American?
Is Trumpism racist? It’s been a contentious question of late. While it’s perfectly evident that Trump does have racist supporters (which he is suspiciously reluctant to condemn), many contend that Trumpism is itself not racist, but merely a justified reaction to the Left’s racial patronage. All Trump’s supporters really want is a properly colorblind society.
It’s not a terribly convincing argument because, among other reasons, Trumpism so obviously represents a desperate cry for group recognition and a demand for group patronage. How has the market been good for us? Bring back our jobs. Even the “America first” motto is clearly focused on a particular vision of America that only a minority of its citizens seem to share.
We may be reaching the point where we need to define more carefully what “racism” really means. To that end, the rhetoric of the alt-right may perhaps be worth examining as an indicator of what some of our “white boosters” are thinking nowadays. There’s admittedly some distance between ordinary Trump supporters and alt-right quasi-intellectuals, but the latter have clearly attracted a non-trivial following in the Trump camp. Alt-rightism shouldn’t be lazily dismissed as a totally detached, insane fringe. It has hit a chord with many ordinary Americans, thriving on the mainstream’s predictable preference for shunning its arguments instead of answering them.
Many alt-right thinkers are willing to argue openly that race matters, that genetics play a non-trivial role in the progression of cultures, and that race is naturally a deep component of personal identity. These arguments can get a lot of oxygen in a world already obsessed with race. Liberals have had their identity politics parties and now alt-righters want theirs, which they expect will be truly amazing because they are in possession of western culture, the best cultural heritage there is.
Conquering Western Civilization
Hear them roar! Alt-righters love to talk about how smart and strong and savvy they are. (Fun game: count the number of times this article brags about those smarty-pants alt-righters and their incredible intellectual heft.) They usually get away with it because they surround themselves with amateurs, who are unprepared for their juvenile jibes. After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler.
Try again, Hayes. Don’t validate the white supremacist’s claim to own Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Boetheus, Bonaventure, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Milton, Da Vinci, Tolstoy, Columbus, Newton, our Founding Fathers and alright, yes, possibly Hitler. Instead, ask him to justify his emphasis on whiteness as a cornerstone of western thought.
Undoubtedly, white men feature prominently among the heroes and visionaries of the West, and it’s reasonable to conclude on those grounds that white men can’t just be natural degenerates, as some liberals seem to suppose. Still, the greatness of the Western tradition doesn’t lie in its whiteness and maleness. It lies in its breadth, adaptability, and universality.
Terence, great playwright of the Roman Republic, told us “I am a man; nothing human is alien from me.” St. Paul told us that in Christ, “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female.” The great thinkers of the high Middle Ages were intensely focused on the human condition, not the Italian or French or male condition. No student of the Western canon ever pauses in the middle of “City of God” to ask, “Wasn’t St. Monica born in Northern Africa? Why are we reading this Augustine clown?”
In short, the Western ethos at its best is profoundly un-tribal. To claim this rich tradition specifically for whites, therefore, is to muddy it and betray its core tenets. American whites can absolutely take pride in their Western heritage. They came from the old world and settled this immense, wild place, extending the great traditions of their forefathers to a whole new land. But if we’re going to take pride in our Western heritage, we should understand that legacy calls for transcending xenophobic ethno-nationalism. We shouldn’t need that, and we have something much better.
The downside of the glorious Western tradition, though, is that its perversion can be ugly, raising dreams of totalitarian domination. (Now a Hitler reference would be acceptable.) Especially here in America, a young nation founded by old-world immigrants with classically liberal commitments, there just isn’t a healthy or grounded way to take pride in whiteness per se.
Slouching Towards Bethlehem
Let’s return to the title question. Why is white pride creepy when black pride isn’t? Shouldn’t we have to choose between a universal ethic of colorblindness, and one that endorses ethnic tribalism at least to some degree?
It turns out that white pride really is categorically different. To understand why, though, we have to think carefully about traditions and their role in lives and cultures. Melanin levels are not in themselves a significant indicator of human character or worth, and whites are not morally inferior (or superior) to any other ethnic group. Nevertheless, cultures do matter, and it could be that “white culture” just isn’t a healthy or organic phenomenon in the way that black culture is or at least can be.
Ethnic pride really isn’t a necessary feature of a healthy psychology, but it can be acceptable when attached to a meaningful tradition that also imposes expectations and requirements. Most of us have probably known kids from Asian backgrounds whose elders are constantly reminding them that their behavior and work ethic will reflect back on their family and clan. That ethos definitely seems to contain an element of ethnic pride. However, it’s incorporated into a tradition and community ethos in such a way as to be a mostly positive influence.
Black pride is connected to a minority subculture that developed in response to intense historical oppression. For most of American history, the non-integration of blacks into mainstream culture was imposed from the outside, so taking offense over the existence of a distinct black subculture would hardly be reasonable. (Of course it doesn’t follow that this culture should be impervious to critique.) It’s an authentic tradition that incorporated an ethnic element for extremely understandable historical reasons. Something similar could be said of most Native American traditions.
Blacks and Native Americans, as the most obviously oppressed ethnic groups in our nation’s history, have also been the most averse to mainstream integration. Other ethnic groups tend to be absorbed more organically into mainstream American culture with the second, third, and fourth generations. They may retain a certain cultural distinctiveness in their names, diets, or cultural festivals, but insofar as they do stand apart, these groups generally adhere to traditions that are substantive enough to keep megalomaniacal urges in check. Ethnic pride isn’t just an entitlement; it’s also an expectation.
Will the Real Cuckservatives Please Stand Up?
White pride really doesn’t have an honorable tradition to call its own. Its claims on Western culture are tenuous, and none of the other reference points (segregation and skinheads) are particularly admirable. So it really does seem reasonable to say that whiteness, although in no way shameful, is not per se a healthy source of pride.
Viewing the matter in this light, it’s somewhat unsurprising that our alt-right partisans actually seem to pride themselves on being brainy rebels and devil-may-care pranksters. They’re not traditionalists in any normal sense, because they stand outside the circle of ordinary civil discourse, and even take joy in the fact. They’re what happens when traditionalism meets expressive individualism, in a world with too many resentful loners and not enough churches. They brilliantly combine the worst of cosmopolitanism (its rootlessness) with the worst of provincialism (its narrow-minded tribalism).
Just as much as the progressives they loathe, alt-righters are the bad fruit of a collapsing culture, taking pride in whiteness because they’re too alienated from more-substantive cultural institutions (family, church, community) to find a more fitting link to their Western forbears. Will the real cuckservatives please stand up? I don’t think it’s the Paul Ryans of the world who are disgracing the legacy of the West.
As every literate conservative has now realized, the collapse of Middle America is one of the great challenges that faces our society in the present moment. We need to rebuild our families and our cultural institutions so people of all backgrounds can find meaningful community and personal identity. White pride is a bad starting point, however. Let’s not sell our Western heritage for a mess of identity-politics pottage.","['suspiciously', 'racist']"

Gun-rights supporters had organized a big rally in Richmond, Virginia, to protest several gun-control bills being pushed by the Democrat-controlled legislature. Tens of thousands rallied peacefully and the news media treated it like it was the start of the second civil war or at least another violent confrontation like Charlottesville.
Several news outlets pushed the claim that the rally was made up of “white supremacists” or “white nationalists.” Instead, they got a rally that was so peaceful that the protesters even picked up their own trash when they were done.
VIRGINIA'S CAPITOL FLOODED WITH GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS FOR SECOND AMENDMENT RALLY
The Washington Post’s front-page story previewing the event led off by saying the rally was, “in the words of some, to fan the flames of a civil war.” The Post mirrored left-wing outlets like Vox, which hyped “online calls for a civil war,” and the UK Guardian which claimed “Gun owners are talking civil war.”
The press did everything it could to terrify people about the event. NBC and its sister network MSNBC couldn’t contain their anti-gun rhetoric. NBC News’ “Dystopia” Reporter Ben Collins called the event “tomorrow's white nationalist rally in Virginia.” Oddly, he also urged reporters to “verify information” before publishing. He was so widely criticized for it, he finally deleted the post.
NBC Anchor Lester Holt pushed a comparison to the riot that happened in Charlottesville where one counter-protester was killed by a white nationalist. “Police on high alert after the governor declared a state of emergency saying he feared another Charlottesville,” said Holt.

It was protesters reciting the “Pledge of Allegiance.”
MSNBC Anchor Craig Melvin continued the media lunacy, claiming, “Armed militia, white nationalist groups from all over the country taking part on MLK day.” Fellow Anchor Andrea Mitchell also went for the comparison, cautioning that, “Virginia residents praying today's rally at the state capitol is not a repeat of the horrible 2017 Charlottesville disaster.”

China’s state-run media quickly seized on the obsessions of their American counterparts over the weekend by linking President Donald Trump to “white nationalism”,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/08/05/chinese-state-media-white-nationalism-deeply-rooted-trumps-mind/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,47.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"China’s state-run media quickly seized on the obsessions of their American counterparts over the weekend by linking President Donald Trump to “white nationalism” and blaming gun violence on the large supply of firearms and loose gun laws in the United States.
The Chinese Communist Party’s Global Times worked the “white supremacist” angle on Sunday, citing the manifesto left by El Paso, Texas, alleged mass murderer Patrick Crusius:
A hate crime is motivated by prejudice, and the victim is targeted because of their social group or race. Many US states have their hate crime laws. However, the number of hate crimes has increased in the US in recent years. This shows that US social conflicts are rising and the problem of racial discrimination is especially serious. The El Paso shooting has worsened fears of the increasing white supremacist threat in the North American country. More importantly, although US President Donald Trump called the El Paso shooting a “hateful act” on Twitter, he has not yet recognized the seriousness of the white supremacist problem. What’s worse, white nationalism is deeply rooted in Trump’s mind. This can be seen from his attitude toward immigration, his insistence on building a border wall and his racist tweets. Instead of resolving the problem, he is even inciting white American people’s hatred.
The astute observer will note that China is not exactly eager to take in large numbers of migrants or refugees from beyond its borders. China takes border security very seriously, especially for the parts of its border that occasionally move further away from Beijing, deploys hardcore nationalist political themes on a daily basis, and is not gentle with minority populations or respectful of their beliefs.
One area where Communist China cannot be accused of hypocrisy is its advocacy of stricter gun control. The Global Times declared the U.S. “urgently needs gun control,” although it acknowledged that “if the shooters’ hatred is not eliminated, they can still use other weapons to vent their anger on innocent people.”
China’s state-run Xinhua news service published a lengthy article advocating gun control on Monday, quoting U.S. advocates who claim the “ubiquitousness of guns is the ‘prime problem’ behind gun violence” and calling for “stricter background checks.”
Xinhua found the political future of gun control in America uncertain, even after the weekend shootings:
Gun control is simply not on most voters’ radars in the lead-up to the 2020 elections, TV news personality and Republican strategist Ford O’Connell told Xinhua. Polls that are conducted soon after the mass shooting tend to show an uptick in the number of Americans that believe gun control is a major issue, but those numbers significantly lessen once the shootings are gone from the news cycle. Generally, only a small percentage of Americans view gun control as a major issue, while healthcare, jobs, and immigration top the list of voters’ priorities. Although the Democrats may introduce bills on a national level, experts said they will not go far in a divided Congress. Instead, the United States is more likely to see laws enacted on a state level rather than on a national level, O’Connell said, adding that the gun control issue will not decide the 2020 election.
Xinhua concluded by quoting the prediction of Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Darrell West that “gun violence is unlikely to change until Democrats hold the House, Senate, and the White House” because “most GOP lawmakers fail to take action because their constituents favor gun rights.”",['obsessions']

But that doesn't mean no one was shot: At least two people suffered self-inflicted gunshot wounds, police said. A 38-year-old man accidentally shot himself while cleaning a handgun and a 15-year-old discharged his firearm during a weapons check, according to a report.
COVERAGE OF CHICAGO'S CRIME WAVE
On Sunday, there were at least three people wounded in shootings across the city. None of them was killed, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Police have said most killings in Chicago are tied to street gangs, with members vying for control of territory or simply retaliating for perceived slights by gang rivals, which these days are typically communicated through social media.
While homicide numbers dropped in many districts in Chicago in 2018, they went up in several neighborhoods on the city’s South and West Sides. Those areas have been plagued for years by gun and gang-related violence, including Englewood and West Garfield Park.
CHICAGO SEES 2 SHOT DEAD, 9 WOUNDED AS VIOLENT JANUARY WEEKEND DRAWS TO CLOSE
According to preliminary numbers, homicides in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, fell by about 100 in 2018, compared to 2017 — though the total again eclipsed the number of homicides in Los Angeles and New York City combined.
Although the decrease in 2018 was significant, the number of killings in Chicago was higher than the combined total in New York City and Los Angeles -- for at least the third straight year.
Police in Chicago reported 561 homicides were committed between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2018. That compared to 660 homicides in 2017 and more than 770 in 2016, which marked a 19-year high that put a national spotlight on Chicago’s persistently high rates of gun violence.

Soule needed to be in the top six runners to advance, but came out eighth because the two biological males were also competing as transgender girls. She is now taking legal action with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) to uphold her rights under the federal law providing equal access to women in education, known as Title IX.
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson hosted Soule and ADF attorney Christiana Holcomb Monday night.
“I’ve gotten nothing but support from my teammates and from other athletes,” Soule said. “But I have experienced some retaliation from school officials and coaches.”
[Related Post: Trans Activists: We’re Normal, But You Must Pay To Fix Us]
This retaliation began after Soule’s parents complained to the school principal, she said, saying she has received difficult requests to complete during practice that did not occur before she spoke out against transgender males competing in girls’ sports. She is told that if she cannot fulfill these requests, then she cannot compete at all.
“Girls like Selina should never be forced to be spectators in their own sports,” Holcomb said. “But unfortunately that is exactly what is taking place when you allow biological males to compete in sports that have been set aside and specifically designed for women like Selina.”
ADF is representing Soule and two other female athletes who filed a Title IX complaint Monday to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. Their complaint requests that the Board of Education “investigate illegal discrimination against the Connecticut athletes,” ADF wrote.
Title IX is supposed to protect girls in athletics so they are not prevented from competing at the highest levels. According to ADF, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has a policy allowing transgender males to compete in girls’ athletics. One of the transgender athletes who competed in Soule’s race broke 10 state sports records previously held by biological women, which took women some 20 years to achieve.
It is unsurprising for biological males to destroy female records. Men are physiologically stronger than woman, having more muscle mass and a higher bone density, ADF reports.

MSNBC anchor Katy Tur on Wednesday boldly declared that there was “almost no middle class” in America.,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/msnbcs-katy-tur-challenged-on-air-after-claiming-america-has-almost-no-middle-class?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20foxnews%2Fentertainment%20%28Internal%20-%20Entertainment%20-%20Mixed%29,fox-news,middle-class,right,47.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"MSNBC anchor Katy Tur on Wednesday boldly declared that there was “almost no middle class” in America -- before a guest promptly replied, “That’s a crazy thing to say.”
Her “MSNBC Live” panel was discussing the proposal from Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., against what they described as the “ultra-rich.”
Warren's campaign described her plan last week as “a bold proposal to tax the wealth of the richest 0.1% of Americans. The legislation, which applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more, is estimated by leading economists to raise $2.75 trillion in tax revenue over a 10-year period.”
With the possibility of the billionaire Howard Schultz, onetime Starbucks CEO, entering the 2020 race as a third-party presidential candidate -- and taking away votes from possible Democratic nominees -- the topic of wealth and taxation has become a primary political topic.
“You have people like Howard Schultz, Mike Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, the list goes on, who make tons of money on a yearly basis and then add exponentially to that within their personal accounts. And a lot of that money – not saying with those people – a lot of that money doesn’t stay in the U.S., it gets funneled off to various offshore accounts and they become tax havens,” Tur told her guests. “What you’ve seen as a result, partially at least, of that is you have this class of people who have more wealth and everybody else combined and almost no middle class any longer, and people who have no money whatsoever who are basically living on the poverty line.”
Conservative commentator John Podhoretz countered Tur on her assertion.

"Since the beginning, Biden has been grasping at the coattails of America’s first black president and relying on his administration’s laurels related to Obamacare, race relations, gun restrictions, and climate change.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/24/bernie-sanders-is-crazy-but-the-only-candidate-voters-actually-like/#.XlQSQ7jGNzU.twitter,federalist,gun-control,right,47.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display.
The results are in, and the socialist swept Nevada. That’s right, Bernie Sanders soared to victory Saturday for his third straight win — first Iowa, then New Hampshire, and now the Silver State. Things are looking pretty good for the Vermont senator, the 2020 presidential front-runner who leads second-place candidate and gaffe-machine Joe Biden by more than 12 points in the latest polls.
Notwithstanding the media’s endless campaign to smear Sanders, his support is stronger than ever — and, it appears, so is he. Despite a health scare in October, Sanders soldiers on determined and forceful at his rallies and on the debate stage. Next to the former vice president, Sanders presents like a spring chicken.
But aside from his physical resilience, how is he doing so well? He’s a 78-year-old white male millionaire seeking the affections of the wokesters, a gruff socialist with bedraggled hair and terrifying policy proposals, a 2016 presidential reject, and a divisive populist — which, in case you hadn’t noticed, we already have one of those.
Sanders praises the radical Green New Deal, champions a Medicare for All plan with a $34 trillion price tag, nods to abortion as a means of population control, and defends bread lines and Fidel Castro’s Cuba. How is this fanatical rerun boomer mopping the floor with a Rhode’s scholar veteran, two progressive women, the other half of the beloved Obama administration, and Michael Bloomberg?
Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display. Every time Sanders opens his mouth, I believe he believes everything he’s saying. Unlike Obama-wannabe Buttigieg, Sanders feels real. His authentic brand is a perfect blend of “I wrote the damn bill!” fire and witty one-liners. Passion over pandering. Compassion over calculation. Compared to the other candidates, Sanders is the obvious choice.
Sanders Is So Much Stronger Than Biden
Biden is struggling. With each debate, he appears increasingly frail, lacking the crucial stamina Sanders would bring against President Donald Trump in a general election. Since the beginning, Biden has been grasping at the coattails of America’s first black president and relying on his administration’s laurels related to Obamacare, race relations, gun restrictions, and climate change. He’s flaky, having flip-flopped his stance on China and the Hyde amendment, which bars the use of federal funding for abortion in most circumstances.
Biden’s Hyde reversal was “never a good thing in politics,” said David Axelrod, an Obama senior adviser. “And it raises questions about his own performance and his own steadiness and his campaign’s performance.”
This isn’t to say Sanders’ policy has undergone zero evolution over his long tenure in the public eye. Critics assailed him during the 2016 cycle, saying he flipped on gun control and health care, switching from a state-run model to favoring federal administration. But unlike other 2020 contenders, Sanders says what he means and means what he says, remaining overwhelmingly consistent in his advocacy even if his forecasted outcomes for democratic socialism are irrational.
Biden’s endless lane-changing between moderate and progressive induces unpredictable whiplash. In 2020, voters know Sanders offers a much smoother ride.
Michael Bloomberg Can’t Keep up with Bernie
Speaking of whiplash, let’s talk about Michael Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat. Bloomberg may be outspending every other candidate by vast margins, but his Super Tuesday strategy, resulting in a non-presence in all but the last debate and absence in Iowa and New Hampshire, isn’t a great look.
“In Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states in the presidential nomination process, candidates brave freezing temperatures to get out and shake hands. In those states, voters don’t expect to be won over with ad buys and policy papers, they want to meet the candidates personally and be wooed,” wrote Rich Cromwell in The Federalist this month. “Mike Bloomberg doesn’t have time for that.”
Not the case with Sanders, who called out Bloomberg for his absence. “I didn’t see Mike in Iowa when we were holding town meetings with folks there,” Sanders said. “Didn’t see him in New Hampshire, hey you know what, I didn’t see him here in Nevada. Didn’t see him in South Carolina. But he thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.”
Not to mention, Bloomberg’s first debate showing was abysmal — while Sanders never broke stride, even ripping Bloomberg for his filthy billions.
Sanders Discards Buttigieg and Warren Robotics
At her peak, Elizabeth Warren led Sanders in the polls by 12 full points, and now she trails him by over 16 points. In an intersectionality battle, Warren should come out on top, but she isn’t. And it isn’t as if the two progressive icons are running on vastly different policy platforms.
Unlike Sanders, Warren wreaks of insincerity. If she can’t even be honest about her heritage, how are voters supposed to trust her promises and endless plans? Despite her best efforts to appear nonchalant and relatable — think Instagram beer video — Warren just can’t quite get the authenticity thing down. It’s as if all her rehearsed-to-appear-unrehearsed talking points pass through a cringe machine on the way out of her mouth.

Former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg is another robotics champion. The media has propped up Buttigieg as smooth and articulate, but his once-punchy and polished phrases, such as “future former Republicans” and “God doesn’t belong to a political party,” are tired. The novelty has worn off. Having apparently learned nothing from the failed campaigns of Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro, Buttigieg continues “Hispandering” in a way that feels forced.

But authenticity matters to voters, and they seem to see it in Sanders. One of Sanders’ volunteers, 33-year-old Shawn Nevarro, thinks of Sanders like a grandfather. “He’s kind of stern, a little grumpy at times. But, at the same time, you really know he’s looking out for you,” Nevarro said recently after a Nevada Spanish-language campaign event. “There is a huge distrust among the Latinx community with the Democratic party that they’re not following through on their promises. … Bernie is the exact opposite. He has a real authenticity.”
That authenticity could shore up the nomination for Bernie Sanders. Wonks in Washington, journalists buzzing around D.C. newsrooms, Twitter pundits, and campaign strategists would all do well to realize most people vote with their gut. They care more about who candidates are than what they say. Donald Trump wasn’t the smoothest candidate in 2016. He didn’t do Instagram lives from his kitchen, didn’t break out in Spanish at his rallies. He made forgotten voters believe he cared about them — because he did. And now Sanders is doing the same. So far, it’s paying off.",['grasping']
Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanders-ups-the-ante-with-higher-wealth-tax-proposal-than-warrens-plan,fox-news,middle-class,right,47.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.
The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""
THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.
Sanders' plan, if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion.
The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.
“Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan.
And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country.""
The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.”
Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion.
Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years.

Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.
He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.”
President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president.
“By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said.",['massive']
Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would provide economic relief to businesses and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/22/democrats-block-senate-coronavirus-package/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,47.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would provide economic relief to businesses and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Senate GOP package failed, with 47 votes in favor and 47 against, which fell 13 votes short of what was necessary to advance the legislation.
An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package.
“I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” the Senate leader said on Sunday.
McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.”
“She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.”
In contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blamed Republicans for advancing legislation without an agreement.
Schumer said on the Senate floor:
The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing. So who’s playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we’re committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee slammed Senate Democrats for blocking the legislation.
NRSC Communications Director said in a statement on Sunday:
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats allowed partisan fervor to thwart a critical coronavirus relief package while our country faces a crippling pandemic. DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren’t beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats’ unthinkable decision to filibuster.
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said in a statement on Sunday:
‪How pathetic. Tonight’s vote was not even on passing a bipartisan plan, it was merely to begin debating it. The American people are hurting, the clock is ticking, but Senate Democrats would rather cave to Speaker Pelosi’s eleventh-hour demands. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should worry more about getting relief to their constituents and less about the House Speaker’s partisan wish list. This cannot go another day.
After congressional Republicans and Democrats were in the final stages of negotiating a long-term coronavirus package deal with the White House, Pelosi announced that House Democrats will move forward with their own bill.
“From my standpoint, we’re apart,” she said earlier on Sunday.

A German doctor, Cornelia Strunz, who works at the Desert Flower Center said that the number of cases of FGM in Germany is rising due to increased migration from Islamic African and Asian countries, dubbed the ‘FGM Zone’ where the practice is widespread.
She advised women and girls who have undergone the procedure to have another surgery to reverse the damage caused by FGM.
“Many women have problems emptying their bladder after FGM. Menstrual blood can’t drain properly. For some, sex becomes practically impossible. Women can also develop fistulas — connections between two body parts which should not exist at all in normal circumstances. One example would be a link between the vagina and rectum, leading to them passing stools through the vagina. Obviously, that’s not very easy to live with”, Dr Strunz told Deutsche Welle.
Female genital mutilation is illegal in Germany, leading many families to travel to their country of origin to have the gruesome ritual performed on their daughters.

Shadia Abdelmoneim, a Sudanese woman living in Germany, had her genitals cut by her midwife while she was under anaesthetic, after the birth of her third child.
“I wanted to go to the toilet, but something wasn’t right. I couldn’t walk and was in considerable pain. When I saw what she had done, I was shocked. She’d cut everything open and then sewn it closed. I had no idea what to do”, Shadia told DW.
She told the German paper that the trauma led to a constant state of fear, for herself and for her three young daughters.
“How could women do something like that to one another, how? Being circumcised is like living in a dead body”, she said mournfully.
In response to the rising epidemic, Berlin is establishing its first anti-FGM centre, however, activists have called for more action including information campaigns that target the families of at-risk children.
“Many teachers and school staff aren’t well informed and don’t recognize the warning signs that a girl’s at risk of FGM. Sometimes, they also struggle to approach the issue in a sensitive manner”, said Charlotte Weil of the Terre des Femmes women’s rights charity, but warned that “a thousand-year-old tradition cannot be abolished in a couple of years.”

"Outraged Democrats vowed to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that could undo the US health care law known as Obamacare, saying on Saturday that they will use their new power in Congress to hold Republicans responsible and “expose their lies.”",https://www.breitbart.com/news/outraged-democrats-vow-to-challenge-court-ruling-undercutting-obamacare/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,47.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Washington (AFP) – Outraged Democrats vowed to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that could undo the US health care law known as Obamacare, saying on Saturday that they will use their new power in Congress to hold Republicans responsible and “expose their lies.”
US District Judge Reed O’Connor ruled Friday that the health care law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is unconstitutional.
The White House said it expects the ruling to be appealed to the Supreme Court. For now, it said in a statement, “the law remains in place.”
But Democrats, who have seen the law survive scores of legal and legislative attacks, vowed to fight back, saying health coverage of millions of Americans is at stake.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Republicans had pretended to care about those protected by Obamacare “while quietly trying to remove that support in the courts. Next year, we will force votes to expose their lies.”
Democrats see the law as a signature achievement of former president Barack Obama, while Republicans dismiss it as governmental overreach. Donald Trump made abolishing and replacing the program a central pledge of his presidential campaign.
In a separate Obamacare case in 2012, five justices in the nine-judge Supreme Court upheld the law. All five remain on the court.
Still, it remains unclear how they might rule in the new case which, if left to stand, has the potential for enormous disruption to the US health care system.
In his ruling Friday, the Texas-based judge said that the full Obamacare program was unconstitutional because Congress, in its 2017 tax overhaul, eliminated a penalty for anyone lacking health insurance who failed to sign up for the program.
The 2012 case was over whether such a penalty was legal — but now that it is gone, O’Connor said, the whole ACA should be stricken down because that provision is “the keystone” of the program.
Trump lost no time in tweeting his delight at the court’s ruling on a complaint brought by several Republican attorneys general and two Republican governors.
“Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
“As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster!” he said.
Trump urged the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the House of Representatives speaker-designate, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, to “pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare.”
– ‘Monstrous endgame’ –
The court ruling came on the eve of the deadline for people to sign up for ACA coverage for 2019.
Angry Democrats blamed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care.
Republicans “know that they can’t repeal the ACA in Congress. So they’ve continued their crusade through the courts,” tweeted Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a consumer-protection activist. “The ACA is still the law of the land.”
Polls consistently show strong public support for the ACA guarantee of coverage regardless of pre-existing health conditions — an issue Democrats used with great success in last month’s midterm elections as they won control of the House of Representatives.
“#Republicans’ legal crusade against the #AffordableCareAct is a political stunt, but a dangerous one that puts health coverage and vital health protections for millions of Americans at risk,” Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tweeted Saturday.
“They found one judge to agree, and now Medicaid expansion could be gone, pre-existing condition protections could be wiped out, prices skyrocket and millions lose insurance. And they call that success,” Democratic congressman Joe Kennedy wrote on the social media site.
O’Connor’s late Friday ruling “exposes the monstrous endgame of Republicans’ all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans’ access to affordable health care,” Pelosi said in a statement.
While the court’s “absurd ruling will be immediately appealed, Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision,” she said.
She vowed that when Democrats take control of the House in January, lawmakers “will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process” to uphold Obamacare.
Opposing the Republican lawsuit were 17 Democratic attorneys general led by Xavier Becerra of California.
They argue that the tax law changes do not mean that the whole Affordable Care Act becomes unconstitutional.
The Texas ruling “is an assault on 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions” and on all who rely on Obamacare coverage, Becerra said in a statement. “Our fight to save Obamacare is far from over,” he tweeted.",['Outraged']

But make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez’s radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America’s economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty. Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t simply want to tweak our existing system, she wants to complete Barack Obama’s goal of “fundamentally transforming the United States of America.”
At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez’s reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the “collective”—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.

Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA doesn’t merely want to create new government-run social programs, it desires, in the words of a member of DSA and the editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin, to “in the long run … end capitalism.” On its website, DSA blames, in part, “the globalization of capital” for “racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a “Green New Deal.” According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.
Even more disturbing, Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal includes “upgrading every residential and industrial building for state-of-the-art energy efficiency, comfort and safety,” a plan that would cost trillions of dollars and give government access to every household in America.

Ocasio-Cortez’s commitment to socialism isn’t limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of “Medicare for All,” legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job “a living wage” and other “basic income programs,” which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.
Ocasio-Cortez backs creating a radical government-funded program that would make public colleges tuition-free and “cancel” the $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, and she pledged during her campaign to support strict gun-control measures and plans to make housing “a human right.”
How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a “60 Minutes” interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn’t be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.
Ocasio-Cortez wants to impose her radical, socialist vision on every single American citizen, a fact most of those in the mainstream media who have spent the past several months fawning over her refuse to tell the public. We must stand against these assaults on capitalism and our personal freedoms, or else the next generation of Americans won’t have access to the same liberties millions of our forefathers sacrificed for.

I have zero interest in contributing to the daily chorus of outrage over Trump’s Twitter feed, or feigning shock and horror over the casual, combative style that fueled him to the GOP nomination and then to the presidency. He does not want Democrats to die. The sky isn’t falling because Trump made a bad retweet. This is not a death blow to the country’s soul.
It is, however, a dangerous sentiment for the president to elevate with his platform. In the video, Griffin’s “only good Democrat is a dead Democrat” line draws cheers and applause before he even clarifies that it wasn’t meant “in a physical sense.” I’m not sure anyone who clapped seriously supports slaughtering Democrats, or believes Democrats are better dead than alive. Trump, once a longtime supporter of Democrats, obviously does not.
Still, it’s unhealthy for the president to spread language that bluntly extreme against his opposing party. It shouldn’t be normalized and it shouldn’t stay on his feed, an ostensible endorsement of unnecessarily extreme rhetoric that could help nudge it into the mainstream.
An edited video of Trump body slamming CNN? Who cares. It’s a joke. Sanctimonious complaints against Trump’s unorthodox presidential conduct are rarely constructive, so I’ll leave that to the folks in the corporate media. I’m not saying Trump has to issue an apology, I just think he should take the tweet down. It’s wrong, and that’s worth saying.","['eccentric', 'clumsily', 'bad', 'analogy']"
"The Democrats’ bill is a massive giveaway to Silicon Valley, to tech donors, and to many Fortune 500 companies in the banking and insurance industries who have replaced their American graduates with blocs of imported Indian and Chinese workers.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/democrats-coronavirus-bill-expands-work-visas-for-foreign-college-graduates/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,48.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The House Democrats’ 1,400-page coronavirus recovery bill threatens the livelihood of millions of American graduates and their families by expanding work visas for many of the roughly 1.5 million foreign college graduate contract workers who hold jobs in the United States.
The summary of the draft bill says:
In recognition that several government offices have closed in response to the coronavirus that are responsible for reviewing and adjudicating work authorization requests or that impact American citizens, intending immigrants, and workers’ ability to live and work in the United States … a provision is included to automatically extend their current status or work authorization.
The unusual phrases — “intending immigrants, and workers’ ability” — covers the many foreign visa workers who are not legal immigrants but are merely contract workers holding jobs in the United States.
The Democrats’ bill is a massive giveaway to Silicon Valley, to tech donors, and to many Fortune 500 companies in the banking and insurance industries who have replaced their American graduates with blocs of imported Indian and Chinese workers.
Many investors, CEOs, and human resources managers prefer the visa workers over Americans, in part, because they can be quickly hired or fired via a network of Indian-run subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. The visa workers are also preferred because they are compliant and legally powerless — the visa workers cannot complain, organize, demand higher wages, or even argue with managers because they know they can be swiftly deported without any legal recourse. The massive supply of foreign workers also raises stock values by cutting white-collar salaries — although many of the visa workers are paid in line with Americans.
The visa worker population includes roughly 1.5 million college graduates, mostly from India, even though roughly 800,000 Americans graduate from college with skilled technical degrees each year.
Roughly 400,000 of these temporary workers can stay permanently in the United States because their employers have nominated them to eventually become legal residents.
But every year, hundreds of thousands of visa workers are forced to go home because their visas expire after a few months, a year, three years, or five years, even after also getting a one-year or a multi-year extension. Yet each year, the departing visa workers are replaced by another wave of arriving college graduate workers.
However, the Democrats’ offer of extended visas does not include any curbs on the arrival of new workers, for example, the annual arrival of 100,000 new H-1B graduate workers. So the bill’s extensions may add at least 100,000 foreign graduates to the labor market in 2020, just as millions of American graduates scramble to find new jobs.
The Department of Homeland Security told Breitbart News on March 19 that it has no plans to change the H-1B inflow in 2020.
Democrats' coronavirus recovery bill sells out America's college-graduate class by expanding job-competition from desperate foreign grads amid the economic crash.
IOW, it is a huge giveaway to Silicon Valley & business donors.'
'Foreign Graduates First'https://t.co/LR1qpNjLPH — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 23, 2020
Foreign college graduates allowed to work in the United States via a plethora of visa programs that are almost entirely ignored by the establishment press. They include the H-1B, L-1, Occupational Practical Training, Curricular Practical Training, TN, E-3, J-1, and B-1 programs, as well as a variety of science-related “post-docs” given to young scientists in university classrooms and laboratories.
The biggest program is the H-1B program. It keeps a population of roughly 900,000 H-1B workers in the United States, largely because the H-1B workers are allowed to stay six years, and many can stay long past their visa expiration once employers merely nominate them for green cards.
Similarly, more than 400,000 foreigners get work permits via the OPT and CPT programs by paying tuition fees to a wide variety or elite, average, or low-tier colleges. Most get one-year work permits, but 70,000 get three-year “STEM-OPT” work permits.
""With predictions of unemployment as high as 30%, it is unconscionable for House Democrats to use the Coronavirus response bill to actually harm American workers."" — Roy Beck, President, NumbersUSA — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 24, 2020
The visa programs also include the H-2B program for the blue-collar workers who are imported by landscaping and resort employers, as well as the H-2A workers who are imported by farm companies. The J-1 program includes thousands of doctors — and at least 100,000 blue-collar seasonal workers.
The visa programs co-exist with a variety of work permits of recent blue-collar migrants, such as the migrants who crossed the border in 2019 and long-resident illegal aliens who ask for an “Adjustment of Status” to citizenship. This work permit category also includes the roughly 600,000 young illegal aliens in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals created by Obama in 2012. Very few of the DACA migrants hold university credentials. Each year, the federal government awards temporary “Employment Authorization Documents” to roughly two million foreigners.
The Democrats’ legislative language is not included in the summary of the 1,400-page bill, But a prior 1,119-page draft directs officials to simply extend existing one-year and multi-year visas that expire during the next 12 months.
At a time when millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Pelosi’s bill includes a measure to automatically extend nonimmigrant work visas. https://t.co/t1n9nWFC0W pic.twitter.com/MvXTKrBnIn — Ben Goldey (@BenGoldey) March 23, 2020
The language could actually increase the number of foreign workers who will compete for scarce jobs sought by Ameican graduates in the economic meltdown.
For example, the language seems to provide three-year extensions to one-third of the roughly 70,000 foreigners with “STEM-OPT” permits. That extension would likely increase the STEM-OPT workforce by 25 percent in 2021 and 2022 — even if no STEM-OPT permits are approved in 2020.
American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers, and White Collar Workers of America. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.
In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.
Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

Trump kicked off his second day on the subcontinent with an elaborate outdoor welcome ceremony in front of the grand Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential Palace in New Delhi.
Cannons fired as the president's armored car, nicknamed ""The Beast,"" rolled through the palace gates accompanied by a parade of red-uniformed guards on horseback. The ceremony included hundreds of military officials, marching with instruments and swords, as well as an official greeting by India's president and its prime minister, Narendra Modi.

A day earlier in New Delhi, at least seven people, including a police officer, were killed and dozens were injured in clashes between hundreds of supporters and opponents of a new citizenship law in India that provides fast-track naturalization for some foreign-born religious minorities but not Muslims, police said Tuesday.
There were no protests in New Delhi on Tuesday, when Modi hosted Trump at Hyderabad House in the capital for the official portion of the president's visit to India.
“The last two days were amazing in every sense of the word,"" Trump said as he and Modi briefly addressed reporters. Trump said progress was being made on trade, fighter-jet purchases and energy.
Modi said he was thankful Trump visited despite the presidential campaign underway in the United States. Trump has said the short India visit was partly due to presidential politics.
“I know that it’s busy time for you in the United States,” Modi told Trump. ""But despite that, you accepted an invitation to visit India. I welcome you and your delegation.”
The leaders were also expected to announce an arms deal Tuesday as part of Trump's jam-packed day in the Indian capital that will include a joint statement with Modi, meetings with business leaders and embassy officials, a solo news conference and an opulent state dinner before the president heads back to Washington.
But Trump has made clear that little progress is expected on the trade front, despite rising tensions between the countries after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium exports. India responded with higher penalties on U.S. agricultural goods and restrictions on medical devices, prompting the U.S. to strip India of its decades-old trade preferences.
Trump told reporters Monday that he's in “no rush” for a trade agreement with India.
Eyes also will be on whether Trump will criticize Modi over the new citizenship law, which has raised fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Trump typically refrains from publicly rebuking world leaders for human rights abuses during his overseas trips. He spoke at length on Monday about measures his administration had taken to combat the threat of “radical Islamic terrorism.”
TRUMP RECEIVES WARM WELCOME IN INDIA
During Monday's protests, police fired tear gas and used canes as they charged at the protesters in several districts of New Delhi. The rival groups hurled rocks at each other and set some houses, shops, vehicles and a gasoline pump on fire. Police closed access to two metro stations in the area.
Trump's comments came during a mega-rally in the world's largest cricket stadium — part of an elaborate welcome for a president who revels in pomp and pageantry.
Trump joked Tuesday that the crowd had been there more for Modi than for him, saying people cheered every time he mentioned Modi's name.
“So they love you in India and that's a good thing.,” Trump said.
Everywhere he went on Monday, Trump was greeted by thousands of cheering Indian citizens, troops of traditional dancers and roadways lined with posters and billboards celebrating his visit. Trump and first lady Melania Trump also went on a stunning sunset tour of the famed Taj Mahal.

Gallup found that 50 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s job handling and 1 percent had no opinion.
Among Republicans, Trump enjoys 94 percent approval and 42 percent approval among independents, both of which are higher than in January. Only 7 percent of Democrats approved of Trump’s job in office.
In contrast, President Barack Obama enjoyed a 46 percent approval rating from Gallup at the same point in his presidency in 2012.
The news for Trump comes amid a big week for the president, on the day of the annual State of the Union address and one day before the expected vote on Trump’s acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial.
The new polling also comes a day after the Iowa caucuses where Democrats are still left without results as the Iowa Democratic Party has delayed reporting them citing issues with the technology used to administer the contest. The first round of official results are expected to be released later this afternoon.
The numbers finding broad American approval of Trump illustrate the catastrophe of the impeachment proceedings backfiring on Democrats that were precisely intended to bring the president’s approval numbers down.
Trump however, has emerged from the partisan impeachment proceedings launched by Democrats triumphantly with the highest approval rating since taking power, while support for the president’s removal has remained underwater for more than a month, according to Real Clear Politics’ aggregate of polls.

Breitbart News reported that NBC News’ Ben Collins used the following tweet, which has since been removed from his account, to describe the pro-2A event as a “white nationalist rally”:
Reporters covering tomorrow’s white nationalist rally in Virginia, I’m absolutely begging you: Verify information before you send it out tomorrow, even if it’s a very sensational rumor you heard from a cop. Don’t become a hero in neo-Nazi propaganda circles with made-up stuff. — Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__)
Breitbart News reported Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action took a similar approach, taking aim at the myriad Second Amendment Sanctuary resolutions in Virginia and trying to tie them to “extremists.” They went so far as to claim Second Amendment Sanctuary resolutions–issued in defense of Second Amendment rights–actually “threaten the safety of communities nationwide by fostering distrust in law enforcement and may deter people from reporting individuals that may hurt themselves or others.”
Last Wednesday, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) cited “violent rhetoric” allegedly associated with the rally in his announcement of a “state of emergency.” That announcement allowed him to temporarily ban the exercise of Second Amendment on the Virginia Capitol grounds; the very grounds on the which the January 20, 2020, pro-Second Amendment rally is being held.

This is more tax than the entire bottom 40 percent of the British population pay: that’s because none of them pays any tax at all.
To understand why Ratcliffe is leaving, you need only glance at the reaction on social media.
Some people hate him because he’s a Brexiteer:

Now put yourself in Ratcliffe’s shoes. You’re a self-made man who, through hard work and determination, has built one of Britain’s most successful businesses. (Ineos, Ratcliffe’s industrial and chemicals business, has a turnover of £45 billion and 18,500 employees.) And in return for the value you have created, the employment you have provided and the tax revenue you have generated, all you get is a bunch of chippy socialists and whiny Remoaners accusing you of being selfish, greedy, and unpatriotic.
Worse, though, from the perspective of a value-creator like Ratcliffe, is that both the British government and the EU have made it increasingly hard for him to do business. Ratcliffe’s business has been particularly hard-hit by the rising cost of energy, driven artificially high by the EU’s war on fossil fuels and embrace of costly, inefficient, unreliable renewables.
Ratcliffe set out the problem very clearly in an open letter he wrote last week to the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker:
Nobody but nobody in my business seriously invests in Europe. They haven’t for a generation. Everyone in my business does however invest in the USA, Middle East or China, or indeed, all three. The USA is in the middle of a $200 billion spending spree on 333 new chemical plants. China has spent that sum annually for many years, constructing its own chemical building blocks. Europe, not so long ago the world leader in chemicals, has seen its market share in the last decade alone collapse from 30% world market share to 15%. This is an industry that employs over 1 million people in high quality jobs in Europe and five times that in indirect jobs. Worldwide, chemicals is an immense industry, considerably bigger than the automotive sector with revenues approaching $4 trillion. Europe is no longer competitive. It has the worlds most expensive energy and labour laws that are uninviting for employers. Worst of all, it has green taxes that, at best, can be described as foolish as they are having the opposite effect to how they were intended.
This is one of the reasons why, in Britain, Ratcliffe has campaigned for an acceleration of the so-far all but non-existent fracking industry. Britain is sitting on trillions of tons of cubic feet of shale gas which, if exploited, would dramatically bring down the cost of energy. Indeed, it appears that Britain’s Bowland Shale is even more rich in gas than Texas:
Ineos, Britain’s biggest private company, claims drilling results from its field in Nottinghamshire suggest “U.S. levels” of shale gas under the soil. Tests found an average level of 60.7 standard cubic feet per tonne of gas – compared with an average 39 (scf) at a vast shale field in Texas. Ineos Shale chief operating officer Tom Pickering claimed it was the most significant drilling result so far in the short history of Britain’s shale industry. He told The Sun: “It’s obviously early days but these are the highest readings in the UK we have ever seen.” Geologists believe there could be 436 trillion cubic feet of gas in this part of the Bowland Basin. This test is consistent with that.
But the Government — and this one’s Conservative; imagine what a Labour one would be like! — is so wedded to green ideology and so nervous of the well-funded anti-fracking campaign industry that it has imposed such extreme precautionary principles on shale gas exploration that the fracking industry has effectively been strangled at birth with red tape.
So Ratcliffe has quit Britain not because he is instinctively unpatriotic or because he is greedy or selfish. He has quit because the EU and his country of birth has prevented him from doing the one thing that successful entrepreneurs care about above all else: business.
It’s quite possible too that lurking in the back of his mind is another clear and present danger: the increasingly likelihood that Theresa May is going to make such a hash of Brexit negotiations that Britain will remain effectively shackled to the European Union, and thus able to enjoy none of the commercial advantages that would have accrued had the United Kingdom become a freebooting global trading economy unburdened by EU tax and regulation.
And if that situation does occur, as well it might, it will increase the likelihood of an even more disastrous eventuality: a hard-left, confiscatory, high-tax, high-regulatory regime under Jeremy Corbyn.
Ratcliffe is leaving Britain, in other words, for the same reason all the wealth creators in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged fly off to Galt’s Gulch.
Entrepreneurs are there to do business, create value and be rewarded for their efforts. It’s amazing, not to say astonishingly depressing, how many people there are in Britain right now – including many if not most politicians – who do not get this.
If I were Sir Jim Ratcliffe I wouldn’t be hanging around for Theresa May to screw up Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn to gorge on what’s left of the carcass. I’d be off like a shot, wouldn’t you?","['Remoaners', 'chippy', 'socialists', 'whiny', 'selfish', 'greedy', 'unpatriotic']"
"A gaggle of representatives from theologically liberal denominations recently issued a statement against Christian nationalism in America, claiming that it threatens both American democracy and the ability of our religious communities to live in peace.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/13/need-christian-nationalism-religious-neutrality-failed/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,49.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Our religious liberty never proceeded from attempts at religious neutrality. It came precisely from the privileged position that Christianity has historically held in America and in the West.
A gaggle of representatives from theologically liberal denominations recently issued a statement against Christian nationalism in America, claiming that it threatens both American democracy and the ability of our religious communities to live in peace.
To be sure, Christian nationalism is an extremely odd place to find the threat to religious freedom in a world that increasingly makes demands like “shut up and wax that woman’s b-lls.” But the irony goes deeper than that. It’s not some stroke of blind chance that lead to religious freedom in the Christian West—it was, in fact, due to our Christian faith.
To be sure, although I know self-described Christian nationalists, I’m aware of no organized political movement for this statement to oppose and so, no standard definition. Nevertheless, I have never found the label to apply to some of what the statement opposes—calls for theocracy, a conflation of American and Christian identities, and certainly not a “cover for white supremacy,” which the statement tosses in to poison the well. I’ve no interest in contending on behalf of such things.
Nevertheless, until “Christian nationalism” coalesces into something more definitive, in my experience the phrase best describes something much simpler: a rejection of the religious neutrality of the late 20th century in favor of 1) a recognition that Christianity has had a unique and privileged influence on our American heritage that overshadows the influences of other faith traditions, 2) a conviction that a Christian understanding of the world should predominate over other worldviews in American civic life, and 3) an understanding that a nation that successfully excised or sufficiently diluted this influence could no longer be called “American” in the same sense as before. Although more general than what the statement condemns, this understanding would actually encompass many Americans, whether they accept the label or not.
Regardless of its other issues, the statement’s crosshairs certainly fall squarely on this simpler understanding as well. The statements condemns the preference for one religion over another, expresses the irrelevancy of religion for civic standing, and contends for all manner of religious neutrality in American civic life.
But our religious liberty never proceeded from attempts at religious neutrality. It came precisely from the privileged position that Christianity has historically held in America and in the West.
Early States Established Churches with Tax Support
The First Amendment forbids the establishment of a state church in the United States, but it in no way imposes the incoherent burden of religious neutrality on our civic institutions, nor demands that the right to free exercise of religion end when one crosses from private life into the public sphere. We are already experiencing the erosion of religious liberties that these erroneous presumptions have caused, with Christian business owners and officials forced to promulgate ideas they abhor and facilitate celebrations that are incompatible with the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Today, when the American left speaks about religious freedom at all, it speaks in terms of “freedom of worship” rather than of free exercise. But freedom of worship is nothing more than the right to go into a private building and follow one’s preferred liturgy on any day of the week so long as it is out of the public view.
The right of free exercise of religion cannot end there, for no religion on earth ends there. Life is a series of choices in which we each decide what’s most important to us. As we order these priorities, every knee eventually bows to something more important than the rest—the “god” we consider to be the Most Important Thing. Whatever the specific details of one’s god, the very nature of a god is that it is supreme—it lays claim to one’s entire life rather than merely one’s private life.
This is true regardless of whether one follows a traditional religion or even refers to one’s highest value as a “god” at all. Even the hedonist, whose god is personal pleasure, does not leave his worship of pleasure behind when he enters the public sphere. If he refrains from certain pursuits in the public eye, it is only because such restraint will net him more pleasure in the long run. Pleasure therefore remains the god that dictates his public activities.
So it is also with the Christian, the Muslim, the secular humanist, and the utilitarian. So when the follower of a god enters into civic life—as anything from a simple voter all the way up to president—he does not and cannot cease following that god. He will instead look to what that god demands of someone who holds the positions he occupies.
Different gods make different demands. One of the reasons theological liberals are so blind on this issue is their ignorant presumption that, at their root, all religions are basically the same—that they all worship the same God, proclaim the same general values and ideals, and merely have different cultural trappings or modes of expression. In such a fantasy, a neutral pluralism is conceivable, but reality is a different matter.
Although there is only one God, there are many gods (i.e., idols) in this world. The extent to which a person will support or even accept things like secular democracy and religious pluralism depends on that person’s god.
Apply This to Today’s Public Life
What then does that mean for American democracy and religious freedom? It means neither can ever be religiously neutral. Some gods demand such things; some gods merely tolerate them; and other gods abhor them. To embrace these things as worthy of our support and protection and prioritize them over other concerns is to favor some gods and therefore some religions above others.
Rather than submitting to a fantasy of religious neutrality, Christian nationalism accepts and adapts to this reality. After all, the Christian faith is the root from which our form of religious freedom grew, and the American nation is the heritage in which it is enfleshed. The positive forms of secularism and religious liberty that had been enjoyed in America grew out of the specifics of Christianity.
Christians, for example, have always held that there is a fundamental distinction between worldly government and the kingdom of heaven. Even the statement acknowledges this. You can see it in the teachings of Jesus—that his kingdom was not of this world, and that we should render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s.
You can see it in St. Augustine, when he wrote of the City of Man and the City of God. You can see it in Martin Luther’s Two Kingdoms theology. You can see it in the Church of Rome’s doctrine of the Two Swords. Different Christian traditions have certainly differed as to how these two realms relate to one another, and some have separated them far more than others. Nevertheless, the distinction has always been there. Civil government can be disentangled from the church precisely because of that Christian distinction.
Every Religion Doesn’t Do Separation of Church and State
But not every religion makes that distinction. Islam, for example, is both a religion and a political ideology. It makes no real distinction between the two. The idea of the Ummah that Muhammad left his followers—a united religious community that transcends tribe and would one day encompass the entire world—has nothing within it to encourage secularism.
Even the simple idea that church and state have distinct authorities and responsibilities is by no means religious neutral.
Political conquest is Muhammad’s legacy because he explicitly commanded it of his devotees, and he established a sharia to which everyone is supposed to submit. According to Muhammad, a pertinent distinction among religions in the world is between Dar al Islam and Dar al Harb (the House of Islam and the House of War).
So in the end, even the simple idea that church and state have distinct authorities and responsibilities is by no means religious neutral. It blatantly gives Christianity a seat of privilege in the way government is organized, and it does so at the expense of some other religions.
The same can be said of American religious freedom. Americans have deliberately refrained from establishing a state church, and we allow extremely broad freedoms for the exercise of religion and the expression of religious ideas. This was a natural outgrowth of Christian ideas, since in Christianity, salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ—a faith that cannot be compelled by force. Accordingly, from the Christian perspective, there is very little point in using the state to enforce religious adherence.
Now, I’m neither claiming that Christians have always respected this reality nor that we’re the only ones who have. But this is precisely where the nationalism comes into the mix.
Western Toleration Comes from Christianity’s Growth
The Western tendency to tolerate different creeds proceeded from the blood and chaos that different Christians inflicted on one another during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. It took considerable time and effort to accept this understanding and begin teaching our governments to loosen their grip on the religious habits of their citizens. This effort hinged on the experiences of many different groups of Christians who sought out places where they could freely adhere to their creeds.
So our religious freedom is not simply an abstract ideal floating in the ether, but a heritage—a specifically Christian one. It is precisely English Christians of that sort who learned this very Christian lesson and brought it with them to this land, where they eventually grew into their own Christian nation. It was also those Christians who decided to extend that Christian freedom to the believers on other creeds.
Our religious freedom is not simply an abstract ideal floating in the ether, but a heritage—a specifically Christian one.
Nevertheless, extending that freedom to other faiths never made it religiously neutral. On the contrary, we embedded our religious understanding of such freedom into the way we governed—blatantly privileging Christianity over other religions.
After all, in most other religions, goodness—however it may be conceived—proceeds from a person’s works as much or more than from his faith. State requirements to make the right sacrifices, participate in the right ceremonies, or live in the proper manner make a great deal more sense in other religions. Likewise, religions that demand the infidels be slaughtered wherever they may be found tend to be far less willing to allow those infidels the same kind of freedoms.
So even when America decides to allow the free exercise of all religions, that very decision privileges religions like Christianity, which are more focused on faith than on following specific laws. This can be seen in the way that free exercise has been judged through our history. In a post-9/11 world, it’s become abundantly clear that even flying planes into buildings can be an exercise of religion.
Where Religious Neutrality Ends
Nevertheless, though we put no prohibition on free exercise per se, we always drew the line at publicly immoral behaviors even when those behaviors are also religious duties for some. Certain faiths, for example, have explicitly allowed or encouraged bigamy, but for most of our history, this was never seriously considered an allowable matter of free exercise.
Not every religion sees the matter the same way. Not every religion even has a natural law tradition.
In decisions like that, the state was not and cannot be morally neutral, any more than it was or can be religiously neutral. In every decision, it weighs one set of goods against another and decides which is of more value.
In America, the weight of those past decisions have always been rooted in the values of the Christians who founded and cultivated this nation. Their substance is indelibly colored by Christianity. Our Declaration of Independence hinges the entire matter of independence on the “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” and ascribes our rights to endowment by the Creator.
These are by no means religiously neutral statements. They are not sectarian, grounded as they are in the language of natural law, but they are nevertheless grounded in a Christian understanding of that natural law. Not every religion sees the matter the same way. Not every religion even has a natural law tradition.
Common Objections Don’t Hold Water
Some would object to this line of thought, claiming that our nation really founded as much by deists rather than Christians. There were certainly a few prominent ones in the mix, but it doesn’t weaken my case in the slightest.
No nation is beholden to religious neutrality, no matter what freedoms it grants.
Deism itself was always an attempt to possess a Christian heritage without possessing a Christian faith. What’s more, the reason deism went defunct so quickly is that this attempt was almost immediately found to be a fool’s errand. The only remaining progeny of deism are those who returned to Christianity and those who proceeded down the road to atheism. Inasmuch as deists contributed to the founding of this nation, they were still operating under the inertia of the Christian heritage they had received.
Others would claim that our religious liberty is no longer Christian because many non-Christian nations have also provided measures of religious freedom. This is true, and I’m quite pleased that they’ve culturally appropriated religious liberty from the Christian West. I believe my heritage to be of value, so I think it’s great when others learn from it.
But that appropriation does not change where our own liberty came from. Neither does it change the fact that these other nations have modified religious liberty according to their own religious understandings. Israel, for example, allows for a great deal of religious liberty, but it is no more religiously neutral than America is. After all, simply believing that Jesus Christ is the messiah voids the right of return granted by Israel to other ethnic Jews. No nation is beholden to religious neutrality, no matter what freedoms it grants.
The Habit of Toleration Can Go Too Far
To be sure, our more recent history has seen a remarkable shift away from our Christian heritage and its moral wisdom. Under the guise of religious neutrality, too many Christians have been tricked into withholding their good judgment from matters of state. This has led to some profound changes, but there’s nothing religiously or morally neutral about them.
We have, for instance, allowed women to choose whether to murder their offspring, but this is not neutrality—in this, the state blatantly values personal autonomy and privacy more than it values love or the right to live. We have forced people to speak as though men are actually women or act as though two women can be married to one-another, but this is not neutral—it demands that Christians set aside their understanding of marriage and sex. Even something as simple as getting rid of blasphemy laws that respected the name of Jesus Christ was never “fair” or neutral—it only cleared the way for new blasphemy laws that respect sexual deviancy and other politically correct subjects du jour instead.
Christian nationalism is rising precisely because more and more Christians are realizing that we’ve been lied to on the matter. We were persuaded to set aside our heritage in public based on a faulty notion of neutrality and the expectation that everyone else would do the same. But everyone else has done no such thing, and we should never have expected or asked them to. We allowed our religious values to be replaced by others’ religious values and, unsurprisingly, have little to show for our foolishness.
If you Think Christianity Is Valuable, You’re a Nationalist
Christian nationalism is not an attempt to requisition the state to teach Christian theology—it would be even less competent at this than it is at all other types of education. Neither is it in any way an incitement to the largely hypothetical violence over which the statement’s authors wring their hands.
It is simply American Christians who believe that their religion is true and their nation valuable contending for their own convictions about goodness, truth, and beauty rather than for others’. We are not “merging” our two identities, as the statement alleges, but holding onto both of them in everything that we do.
Far from destroying American democracy and religious liberty, Christian nationalism embodies the very same spirit that built that heritage of ours in the first place.","['gaggle', 'threatens', 'nationalism']"
Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/21/facts-mass-shootings-support-gun-ownership-not-gun-control/?utm_source=The+Federalist+List&utm_campaign=e01eef4417-RSS_The_Federalist_Daily_Updates_w_Transom&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cfcb868ceb-e01eef4417-83843357,federalist,gun-control,right,49.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democrats shouldn't add more gun control laws to the books when the shootings in both Parkland and Aurora could've been prevented by existing policies.
On February 14, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) marked the one-year anniversary of a horrific school shooting by threatening that President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall could be used as precedent for future gun control.
Calling the 2018 massacre of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America,” Pelosi remarked, “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President?”
“A Democratic president,” she threatened, “can do that.”
By painting the tragic Parkland shooting as a failure of gun control, however, Pelosi disregards the indisputable fact that the shooter’s rampage was enabled by years-long, system-wide failures of policy and personnel.
Andrew Pollack, the father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, is on a campaign to hold those who failed the Parkland victims accountable. This includes the resource officer and deputies whose inadequate response allowed the shooting spree to continue for 11 long minutes, the FBI officials who ignored a tip about the shooter’s intentions just over a month prior to the attack, the Broward County superintendent whose “Promise” program kept students’ criminal activities from being reported to police, and the school officials, mental health providers, and officials from the Broward Sheriff’s Office who ignored a series of red flags, not to mention murderer’s lengthy history of violence and mental health issues.
These Tragedies Happened Despite Legal Barriers
Judging by the sheer number of pending legal claims against Broward Country Public Schools (103 as of December 2018), Pollack is not the only parent of a victim or survivor to find that fault extends beyond the shooter and his weapon. The families of two Parkland victims are also filing suit against the manufacturer of Cruz’s AR-15, and the store where he purchased it.
On Friday, just one day after Pelosi threatened future gun control initiatives, America experienced another preventable and horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois. After he was fired from his job, Gary Martin used a pistol he unlawfully possessed to shoot employees in his workplace. Martin killed six employees, and wounded five of the police officers who responded to the scene before he was killed by police.
As a convicted felon, Martin should not have possessed a weapon. When applying for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card in January 2014, he lied about his previous felony conviction for aggravated assault. After he purchased his pistol in March, Martin also applied for a concealed carry permit. When the fingerprinting process revealed Martin’s criminal history in Mississippi, police turned down Martin’s application, revoked his FOID card, and informed him that he must relinquish his weapon within 48 hours. Instead, Martin kept the pistol.
Non-compliance with police orders regarding weapons and FOID turnover is not uncommon. In 2018, 10,818 FOID cards were revoked by the Illinois State Police, who admitted on Monday that “in most instances” a weapon and official record are not returned. Law enforcement is able to petition a judge for a search warrant to retrieve guns that are not turned over, but according to Illinois law, they are not required to do so.
In Aurora, existing gun laws failed. In Parkland, a host of authorities and policies failed. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.
Pelosi’s threat of future gun control initiatives does not stand alone. During the 2018 midterm elections, more candidates aired “spots promot[ing] gun control than oppos[ing] it.” In the wake of the Aurora attack, Democratic presidential candidates are loudly decrying gun violence, and advocating for stricter gun control measures.
Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. Last Wednesday, while the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to require background checks on every gun sale or transfer, Democrats rejected Republicans’ efforts to add an amendment that would ensure law enforcement is notified “when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check.”
Most Americans Favor Legal Gun Ownership
A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. According to a March 2018 poll, 58 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “increase[s] public safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.”
James Craig, who returned to his native Detroit as its chief of police in June 2013, believes in the strength of a legally armed populace. After working as a police officer for nearly three decades in Los Angeles, “where ‘it took an act of Congress’ to get permission to carry a gun,” Craig transferred to Portland, Maine. There, he discovered a vastly safer city, and one where gun ownership was common. It was in Portland that Craig realized “the effect…good Americans who are armed can have on reducing violence.”
Prior to Craig’s arrival, Detroit was among the most violent cities in the country. According to FBI statistics, 80 in 1000 Detroit residents “became victims of violent or property crime each year.” In 2012, 386 criminal homicides had been reported in the city. To bring down crime rates, the new chief of police urged Detroit residents to legally and safely arm themselves.
In 2014, Craig’s department issued 1,100 handgun permits. That year, the number of home invasions decreased by 38 percent, with the numbers of shootings and robberies likewise decreasing. Of the 1,800 felons queried in a 2015 survey, 57 percent identified their biggest fear as “armed citizens.”
Since Craig took over the department, Detroit has experienced “double-digit drops” in “nonfatal shootings, robberies, and carjackings.” Although the city’s levels of violence still leave much to be desired, in 2017, Detroit recorded its “lowest number of homicides since 1966.”
Craig believes a conversation surrounding guns should not be about gun control, but “crime control.” As he explains, “individuals who are criminally inclined…when in possession of a weapon, create the problems.”
Before Democrats look to new measures of gun control, they should concern themselves with the enforcement of existing gun laws, keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, and holding accountable institutions and policies which allow threats to go undetected.
If Democrats impede law-abiding Americans from arming themselves to protect their fellow citizens, and themselves, then the only people with access to weapons will be those who purchase them illegally, with criminal intent.",['shortsighted']
"Borrowing from Hillary Clinton, leftist Italian media have labeled those attending the pro-family Congress a “list of deplorables,” calling pro-life and pro-family advocates “neofascists” and “homophobes.”",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/03/28/gays-radical-feminists-protest-veronas-pro-family-congress/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,50.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"VERONA — Busloads of leftist agitators are descending on the northern Italian city of Verona to protest the year’s largest international pro-family event, scheduled to take place March 29-31.
The 13th annual World Congress of Families is predicted to be the largest in its history, and over a thousand journalists from around the world have already been accredited to cover the event, which is conceived as a celebration of traditional marriage, the family, and the right to life from conception to natural death.
Although the Congress officially begins on Friday, on Wednesday, groups of protesters were already demonstrating in Verona, and a number of counter-events have been planned for the weekend: one organized by radical feminists and another by Italy’s biggest LGBT group.
The feminist group “Non una di meno” has organized a demonstration titled “Verona, Transfeminist City” with speakers from international feminism such as Marta Dillon of Argentina, Eva von Redecker of Berlin’s Humboldt University, and Adriana Zaharijevic from the University of Belgrade.
“Verona once again presents itself as a laboratory for national political experimentation and the attack on abortion and the rights of women and LGBT subjectivity is the privileged ground on which the political right and pro-life movements have come together,” event organizers have stated.
Arcigay, Italy’s most representative pro-LGBT group, responsible for organizing gay pride marches around the country, has convoked its own protest event in Verona for Saturday.
“We are stunned that this container, which carries the worst homo-trans-phobic and misogynistic thought, is arriving in Italy, the first Western European country to host it. This is an unprecedented, frightening fact that does not bode well for the recognition of human and civil rights,” said Arcigay’s General Secretary Gabriele Piazzoni.
Borrowing from Hillary Clinton, leftist Italian media have labeled those attending the pro-family Congress a “list of deplorables,” calling pro-life and pro-family advocates “neofascists” and “homophobes.”
According to Brian Brown, president of the International Organization for the Family and a key figure behind the Congress, the vehemence of the protests is an encouraging sign for the pro-family and pro-life movements around the world.
“There is so much resistance because the tide is starting to turn,” Mr. Brown told Breitbart News. “After decades of being told that the family was archaic or a hindrance to progress, more and more people are realizing that the breakdown of the family has been an unmitigated disaster.”
Things are different now than they were even a decade ago, Brown asserted, which explains the desperation of radical leftists.
“Around the world, even in the heart of Europe there is a growing movement to protect and support the family. That’s why we called this year’s World Congress of Families Wind of Change,” Brown said. “The beginnings of a major change in direction are starting. It’s up to us to help that movement grow.”

King went on to defend his tweet with a number of confused and contradictory statements.,https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/14/how-not-to-defend-western-civilization/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,50.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Being an American isn't about your color or ethnicity. Steve King doesn't get it. Nor do many of his detractors
“To be an American is an ideal,” the political theorist Carl Friedrich wrote in 1935, “while to be a Frenchman is a fact.” Iowa’s Steve King doesn’t seem to grasp this distinction. Nor do many of his detractors, who regularly conflate any defense of Western civilization with “white nationalism” or racism.
Commenting on the Dutch politician Geert Wilders this weekend, King caused a furor, tweeting that, “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” Well, why not? If newcomers embrace the principles and virtues of American life and its traditions, the more babies they have the better. Unless your fears are pinned to skin pigmentation rather than assimilation, what difference does it make?
King went on to defend his tweet with a number of confused and contradictory statements. “It’s the culture, not the blood,” King explained on CNN. “If you could go anywhere in the world and adopt these little babies and put them into households that were already assimilated into America, those babies will grow up as American as any other baby with as much patriotism and as much love of country as any other baby. It’s not about race, it’s never been about race … It’s a clash of cultures, not a race.”
That’s fine. But King, a “champion of Western civilization,” soon waded into disconcerting messaging about taking care of “someone else’s babies” and claiming that “intermarriage” will make America “homogeneous.” When you start talking about human beings in this way, you’re framing the argument in ethnocentric and racial terms — culture as blood — and it undercuts the ideals you’re supposedly defending.
So King deserves the condemnation he’s been getting for making the immigration debate about people rather than their ideas. Yet most coverage of congressman’s statement also seems to take offense at his defense of “Western civilization.” Once it was merely in poor form to claim our system was better. Now, evidently, it’s racist.
Steve King is wrong: Civilization is threatened by racism & xenophobia that divide us & encourage violence. I condemn hate & welcome all — Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) March 13, 2017
Fact is, the modern Left debates immigration using the very same ethnocentric and racial ideas as King, but for entirely different reasons. While one side adopts it for exclusionary purposes, the other uses it as a cudgel of relativism. These days, there is precious little difference between ideas and identity on the Left. So we are asked to treat Islam as a racial or ethnic designation rather than a philosophical/religious/ideological one. This way we don’t debate ideas, history, or beliefs, but color. And if you fail to accept the debate on these terms, you will be subjected to vacuous accusations of “Islamophobia.”
Yet, the rise of the far-Right seems, in part, to be a reaction to the Left’s abdication of defending liberalism. I mean, does anyone believe the Dutch became inveterate racists overnight? Or is the competitiveness of Wilders’ party in Holland predicated on a long-term struggles that have generated upheaval across Europe? The flow of refugees into these nations has featured many people with ideologies and theologies that are in conflict with the values of their new homes. Not all, but enough.
As Sam Harris noted in a 2006 Los Angeles Times piece:
… the failure of liberalism is evident in Western Europe, where the dogma of multiculturalism has left a secular Europe very slow to address the looming problem of religious extremism among its immigrants. The people who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are actually fascists. To say that this does not bode well for liberalism is an understatement: It does not bode well for the future of civilization.
When newcomers aren’t asked to embrace your ideas and are sheltered from the responsibility of assimilation, they created “parallel societies,” as German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently put it. Today, American liberals find the idea of demanding, or even nudging, newcomers to assimilate to be disagreeable and disrespectful act. Judy Chu, for example, welcomes “all;” every single person who has desire to come here, no matter what they believe or how likely they are to become Americanized.
Remember how incensed people got when Trump floated his (admittedly, impractical) ideological test for immigrants. This wasn’t a test for color, race, or ethnicity, but one that gauged beliefs — which is not new to immigration policy. The problem is that many assumed philosophical tests would have a disproportionate effect on Islamic refugees — a de facto ban. But if Chileans, Japanese, and Indians can pass American literacy tests but Pakistanis, Saudis, and Iraqis can’t, doesn’t it tell us something about Islam rather than the test or the color of the person taking it?
It must be pointed out that Muslims have, for the most part, successfully integrated into American society. Unlike Europe, we are structurally and geographically built to assimilate diverse populations. But if we’re going to allow more people to come here from parts of world infested with illiberalism, it seems rational to be cautious and avoid Europe’s mistakes. Because the idea that mass immigration – and I prefer a lot more of it than most conservatives — doesn’t come with any attendant problems is simply ludicrous.
Moreover, why would anyone be offended by someone saying that “Western civilization” is preferable to the alternative? No one is forced to come here. So why would any newcomer be insulted if his prospective home expected him to adopt Western values? That’s what we do here. To be American is an ideal. Sometimes, of course, this civilization fails in the most violent or brutal or embarrassing ways. But, in the aggregate, human flourishing does better, by any measure, under this tradition than others. We shouldn’t let people on the Right or Left distort what it means.","['defend', 'confused', 'contradictory']"
"Surprising because in its early trailer, FX’s Anti-Phyllis Schlafly Series Mrs. America sold itself as a celebration of second-wave feminism as it waged righteous war against the dark forces of the “patriarchy.”",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/04/16/hulu-phyllis-schlafly-series-mrs-america-paints-feminists-as-shallow-backstabbers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,50.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Much has been and will be written about the way FX’s Mrs. America defiles and maligns the late Phyllis Schlafly, the iconic conservative activist and author who defeated the Equal Rights Amendment and gave conservative women a voice on the political stage. The limited series, whose first three episodes dropped this week on Hulu, has plenty of bile to go around. Surprisingly, it saves some of it for the radical feminists who are the show’s ostensible heroines.
Surprising because in its early trailer, Mrs. America sold itself as a celebration of second-wave feminism as it waged righteous war against the dark forces of the “patriarchy.” But as the early episodes show, the series feels little nostalgia for the heydey of Gloria Steinem, whom it portrays as vain and self-centered. As the pretty young face of the movement, Steinem (Rose Byrne) has few qualms about pushing aside first-wavers embodied by the frumpy Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman), who deeply resents being put out to pasture by her acolytes.
And in an episode reminiscent of Bernie Sanders, Mrs. America shows how feminists colluded with the Democrat establishment to throw presidential hopeful Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba) under the bus in order to prop up the more centrist George McGovern. Chisholm, the first black woman to run for the White House, feels the bern of betrayal. The fact that her so-called sisters are exclusively white only worsens the sting.
Today’s mainstream media doesn’t want you to remember, but the early days of feminism were rife with ideological battles and backstabbing that would put a medieval court to shame. Feminists fought among themselves over pornography, gay rights, and the role of minorities in the movement.
Mrs. America restores some of the warts even as it airbrushes others, resulting in a docu-fiction that is a bit less knee-jerk than you might expect from liberal Hollywood.
Of course, it’s a minor concession given how Mrs. America so blatantly stacks the deck against Phyllis Schlafly (Cate Blanchett), who so far comes off as a conniving ice queen and a walking anachronism — a devoted wife and mother of six who performs sit-ups at home in her pearls and admires how eagles mate for life.
In an early scene, the feminists receive a mailer of Schlafly’s soon-to-be-influential newsletter, which they carelessly toss aside. “Who the hell is Phyllis ‘Shaffley’?” one of them asks. The series plays Schlafly’s values for laughs, but it also observes how feminism’s arrogance and condescension toward middle American values was the movement’s biggest miscalculation.
It’s a lesson that many on the left still haven’t learned.
To be clear, though, this is part of a broader Schlafly-focused revisionist trend in Hollywood. Last year, Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel smeared Schlafly in its third season by having a character describe her as “racist and sexist,” while another character implied that she was anti-Semitic. In reality. Schlafly was pro-Israel and expressed admiration for Golda Meir.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal lawmakers, underscoring how the 2020 field is being pulled further left by the influential progressive wing.
An analysis by Fox News shows at least eight potential Democratic candidates have voiced support for or touted aspects of the proposal, which amounts to a drastic overhaul of the U.S. economy and government benefit system.
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., 37, who says he is looking at a 2020 presidential run, told Fox News he was “excited” to support the proposal and be a part of the process.
“When it comes to climate change, we need to advance policies that don’t ask Americans to choose between their jobs and clean air and water,” Swalwell told Fox News this week. “We can do that by greening the grid with investments in renewable energy and a wage and skills guarantee for any displaced worker.”
OCASIO-CORTEZ FLOATS 70 PERCENT TAX ON RICH
He added: “It’s time to go big on this issue with bold solutions. I welcome a Green New Deal and am excited to offer additional ideas to create meaningful jobs and address the crisis of climate change.”
Higher-profile potential candidates ranging from Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Sen. Cory Booker also have voiced support.
Fox News reached out to nearly two-dozen Democrats seen as potential 2020 candidates to ask about their position on the Green New Deal. Some voiced support for the plan or pointed Fox News to prior statements of support, though most did not respond to the requests for comment or declined to comment -- leaving open the possibility that more potential candidates could lend their support in the coming weeks.
The expansive Green New Deal proposal has floated in Democratic circles for years but was given new life by the Sunrise Movement and liberal lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez. The package would focus on income inequality and climate change, combining ideas incorporated in former President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s signature New Deal, and modern ideas like renewable energy and resource efficiency.
A draft text of the plan has circulated around Congress and laid out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and “dramatically” expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. The proposal describes this as a “historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.”
And it includes a host of other liberal wish-list items like: a job-guarantee program offering a “living wage job to every person who wants one;” a “just transition” for workers affected by climate change; basic income programs; universal health care and more.
The proposal already has garnered support from dozens of House Democrats, though it's unclear how far Democratic leadership in the chamber is willing to take the idea. But at least as a political talking point, it's beginning to take off in the field of hopefuls eyeing a challenge to President Trump.
Sen. Booker, D-N.J., issued his endorsement for the proposal last month. When reached by Fox News, a spokesperson for Booker pointed to his December tweet on the matter.
“We must take bold action on climate change & create a green economy that benefits all Americans. Thank you to @sunrisemvmt & activists for your inspiring work. Excited to support a #GreenNewDeal,” Booker tweeted on Dec. 14.
Sen. Warren, D-Mass., who has already launched an exploratory committee for a 2020 run, “supports the idea of a Green New Deal to ambitiously tackle our climate crisis, economic inequality, and racial injustice,” a Warren aide told Axios earlier this month.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has been on the leading edge in Congress pushing for universal health care and free college education, also offered his support for the plan, along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.
Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., endorsed the proposal last month and said he would introduce his own version of a Green New Deal in 2019.
“We absolutely have to make sure this is part of the conversation going into 2020,” Merkley told The Washington Post last month. “Mother Nature is sending this message, and the youth have double down on the message.”
Former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, poised to make a 2020 announcement this weekend, will reportedly support the proposal, telling NBC News that ""we should do that,"" when asked about the plan.
And Democratic darling Beto O’Rourke, who was narrowly defeated by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in the midterm elections, is apparently supportive of the ""concept.""
“Beto is supportive of the concept and how it invests in green jobs, and is looking forward to engaging more on the issue as it continues to develop,” an O’Rourke spokesman said in a statement to the Huffington Post.
MOST DEMOCRATS IDENTIFY AS LIBERALS FOR FIRST TIME, UNDERSCORING LEFTWARD TILT OF PARTY
Other 2020 prospects, like Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, have weighed in, but not yet offered official positions on the plan.
Harris’ staff reportedly has been in touch with the organizers behind the Green New Deal. Brown reportedly said he did not know enough about the details of the plan to take an official position yet, though sounded skeptical.
“I’ve never bought that you play off workers against the environment because what I have seen is good environmental policy means more good jobs,” Brown said on the podcast “Pod Save America” last month.
Former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., who was essentially the first 2020 candidate out of the gate, praised the idea without outright endorsing it.
""We need to act on climate change and a Green New Deal, which is broadly defined as combining policies that reduce emissions and help people economically, is a smart approach. I am less interested in slogans and branding than I am in real policies, which is what I'm running on. The details really matter.,"" Delaney said in a statement to Fox News. ""The best start is the bipartisan one I introduced in Congress with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICD) - a carbon tax with revenues going back to the American people through a dividend. This plan can result in a 90% reduction in GHG by 2050 by changing behavior, encouraging innovation in new technologies and using market forces to reduce emissions.""

It’s odd, isn’t it, that so many of the folks who warn us about the authoritarianism of the GOP also happen to support an array of policies that coerce Americans to do things they don’t want to?
Take, for example, the four reliably liberal Supreme Court justices, all of whom believe it’s OK to compel Americans to pay dues to political organizations they disagree with, to coerce them to say things they abhor, and to compel them to create things that undermine their principles.
For some, myself included, the prospects of a court run by people who ignore the Constitution was the best argument for Donald Trump in 2016. The question was, “What’s scarier, a Trump presidency or a progressive Supreme Court?” I imagine the answer is becoming a bit clearer for many conservatives.
In three cases this term — the rulings that stopped the Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission from destroying Jack Phillips’ business over a thought crime, California’s attempt to force people to support abortion, and public-sector unions from continuing their long-standing policy of forcing workers to fund their political activities — the court has handed the Constitution clear wins.
I mean, has there been a bigger win for small-government, real-life conservatives over the past few decades than the Janus v. AFSCME ruling? The decision not only fortifies the First Amendment by explicitly finding compelled speech unconstitutional, but also calls out the Left’s authoritarian political machinery, which has been holding many American communities, school systems, and workers hostage for decades.
“It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority. “Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.”
The Janus ruling also stipulates that employees must now affirmatively opt-in — rather than having to opt out — of unions before having to pay fees. The court understood that dollars are fungible, and every one of them should be considered a matter of speech.
Certainly, it would not have been the case had Hillary won. We know this by taking a peek at a counterhistory offered by reading the liberal dissents.
“The First Amendment,” writes Justice Elena Kagan, “was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance — including over the role of public-sector unions.” The idea that the court should decide who deserves First Amendment protections, or that those protections should be contingent on the vagaries of “democratic governance,” whatever that means, is as corrupt as any of the dumb things Trump has ever said about free expression. The Supreme Court is built to withstand the whims of democracy, of majoritarianism, not to surrender to them. (Then again, Kagan gives away her political game when she worries that “Public employee unions will lose a secure source of financial support.”)
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, accused the majority of weaponizing the First Amendment — an unconscionable position for a person tasked with “faithfully and impartially” discharging the duty to protect the inherent rights of all Americans. The dissenters have perverted the intent of the Founders. It’s none of Sotomayor’s business how we use free expression. It’s her business to protect it.
And in an environment where Americans are increasingly drifting apart ideologically, culturally, and politically on virtually every major issue, gridlock has become the de facto state of affairs in DC, and the court becomes even more important. Whatever Trump’s predilections or beliefs might be, to this point the First Amendment has been strengthened under this presidency.
Don’t get me wrong: Trump’s attacks on the press can be harmful and gratuitous (though, of course, not every tweet critical of CNN is an attack on the foundations of the First Amendment). Yet they are far less consequential than allowing SCOTUS to codify attacks on free expression.
Not that we should forget that we can thank Mitch McConnell for giving Trump the Neil Gorsuch seat. The much-disparaged Senate leader withstood immense political pressure and preposterous attacks when stopping President Obama from stacking the court.
But the president kept his word when it came to the Court. It’s still early in the Trump era, of course, and we really have no idea how the residual political effects of our acute partisan battles or investigations or ugly rhetoric or the often-incompetent presidency will manifest in the long term. Perhaps Trump’s unpopularity will make it harder for originalists to find their way to the Supreme Court in the future. Perhaps not. It’s also true that in no time in modern American history has a president’s disposition and rhetoric conflicted more dramatically with the outcomes of his administration. But that has been a net win for the Constitution.","['weaponizing', 'unconscionable', 'position', 'perverted']"
Edwards’ allies are pushing a narrative that supporting Rispone is akin to being a racist like infamous white supremacist David Duke.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/05/democrats-deploy-race-card-in-louisiana-governor-race/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,51.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Backers of Louisiana Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards are playing the race card against supporters of President Donald Trump, as the contest between Edwards and Republican Eddie Rispone heats up in the final week plus of the campaign.
Edwards’ allies are pushing a narrative that supporting Rispone is akin to being a racist like infamous white supremacist David Duke.
New radio ads launched this week by the Black Organization for Leadership Development (BOLD) urging people to vote against Rispone and for Edwards by claiming that Rispone and his highest-profile supporter President Trump are racists.
“Y’all remember that sickening feeling you got when you woke up and realized that Donald Trump was elected president? The nightmare is happening again—what is the difference between David Duke, Eddie Rispone and Donald Trump? The only difference is that Eddie Rispone will be governor if you do not stop him,” the BOLD ad narrator New Orleans City Councilman Jay Banks says in the ad.
“These people are telling you every day they do not care about you or anyone who looks like you,” Banks continues. “First it was the Muslims, then it was the Hispanics. Do you have any doubt what ‘Make America Great Again’ really means? Go and vote against hatred. Go and vote for your family and the people you care about. Go vote for John Bel Edwards.”
Edwards and Banks are particularly close allies. In fact, in 2017, Edwards went out of his way to publicly endorse Banks and praised him effusively.
“You all know what a quality individual he is and what a good job he will do in New Orleans, because, quite frankly, you may not think there’s much tie-in between the governor of the state of Louisiana and a district councilman in New Orleans,” Edwards said of Banks. “But the truth is, it takes teamwork at all levels. … I’m excited to be here and support Jay and his candidacy for Council here in New Orleans.”
This radio ad comes as door hangers making the same case—that Trump, Rispone, and their supporters are racists—have appeared throughout Louisiana in the black community.
The door hanger ads on one side show photoshopped pictures of Rispone, Trump, and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal collaged together with a photo of Duke. “Eddie Rispone stands with Donald Trump & David Duke,” text under the photoshopped collage reads. “Our turnout was under 38% in the primary. Vote early Nov 2 to Nov 9.”
On the book of the door hanger ad, it lists out several “facts” about Rispone—all of which are untrue.
The first one, which is obviously false because no governor could do this even if he wanted to and Rispone has not said any such thing, says that Rispone will if elected “take away your healthcare and freeze Medicaid enrollment.”
The second one falsely rips Rispone, a businessman before he decided to run for office, for having “failed to pay employees and refused to pay their medical bills.”
The next one falsely claims that Rispone would take away voters’ kids’ school lunches. “Eddie Rispone wants to eliminate free school lunches and food stamp assistance,” the ad claims. Again, no governor has the ability to do this—and these are federal programs anyway, so they come from Washington, D.C., not from the state of Louisiana.
Pro-Edwards yard signs touting that same lie on school lunches have popped up around Louisiana too, urging people to support the Democrat governor in order to “Save Our Kids School Lunch.”
It is unclear if Edwards’ campaign itself, or some other outside group like BOLD or another one supporting Edwards, rolled out these ads via door hanger and yard sign as they are unlabeled as to who is paying for them.
Rispone is crying foul about the race-baiting ads from Edwards’ allies. According to a report in the Advocate, a Louisiana newspaper, the GOP gubernatorial candidate called Edwards’ team’s race-baiting ads “disgusting” and ripped Edwards and his pals for “playing the race card again.”
“They’re comparing Donald Trump and me to David Duke, that’s how low they will stoop to win this race. It’s incredible,” Rispone said, adding: “Nothing could be further from the truth than me being a racist.”
Rispone has even launched radio ads of his own exposing the Edwards team’s exploitation of race to try to win the election.
“How desperate is liberal career politician John Bel Edwards?” a narrator says in the Rispone radio ad. “So desperate that instead of denouncing radical leftwing attacks on Eddie Rispone and Donald Trump, he’s relying on them. Just listen.”
Then the ad plays the entire Banks BOLD ad that Edwards is using to try to win.
﻿
“John Bel Edwards–too weak to stop these hateful attacks,” the narrator concludes. “Too cowardly to condemn them. John Bel Edwards, too liberal for Louisiana.”","['racist', 'infamous', 'pushing', 'narrative', 'white']"

While Politifact reports Sanders “did vote against the Brady bill, including a shifting mix of background check provisions, five times,” Biden is not addressing the fact checks have proven to be no hindrance to determined, mass public attackers.
In fact, nearly every mass public attackers of recent memory–going back some 12 or 13 years–acquired his guns via a background check.
Here is a short list of attackers who acquired their guns via background checks:

the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009)
the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007)
The handful of mass public attackers who did not acquire their guns via background checks–attackers like the one who struck Sandy Hook Elementary School—got their guns via thievery, so no amount of point-of-sale gun control would have stopped them. This is important at a time when Democrats in the House and Senate, and the presidential primary race, are all pushing an expansion of background checks as crucial for American safety.
On February 18, 2020, Breitbart News reported a John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study showing that expanded backgrounds do not reduce the mass shooting rate. Thus, whereas Democrats are fond of pushing even more background checks as a way of stopping future attacks, Johns Hopkins study found that expanded background checks are not “associated with lower rates of fatal mass shootings.”

On February 14, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) marked the one-year anniversary of a horrific school shooting by threatening that President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall could be used as precedent for future gun control.
Calling the 2018 massacre of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America,” Pelosi remarked, “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President?”
“A Democratic president,” she threatened, “can do that.”
By painting the tragic Parkland shooting as a failure of gun control, however, Pelosi disregards the indisputable fact that the shooter’s rampage was enabled by years-long, system-wide failures of policy and personnel.
Andrew Pollack, the father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, is on a campaign to hold those who failed the Parkland victims accountable. This includes the resource officer and deputies whose inadequate response allowed the shooting spree to continue for 11 long minutes, the FBI officials who ignored a tip about the shooter’s intentions just over a month prior to the attack, the Broward County superintendent whose “Promise” program kept students’ criminal activities from being reported to police, and the school officials, mental health providers, and officials from the Broward Sheriff’s Office who ignored a series of red flags, not to mention murderer’s lengthy history of violence and mental health issues.
These Tragedies Happened Despite Legal Barriers
Judging by the sheer number of pending legal claims against Broward Country Public Schools (103 as of December 2018), Pollack is not the only parent of a victim or survivor to find that fault extends beyond the shooter and his weapon. The families of two Parkland victims are also filing suit against the manufacturer of Cruz’s AR-15, and the store where he purchased it.
On Friday, just one day after Pelosi threatened future gun control initiatives, America experienced another preventable and horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois. After he was fired from his job, Gary Martin used a pistol he unlawfully possessed to shoot employees in his workplace. Martin killed six employees, and wounded five of the police officers who responded to the scene before he was killed by police.
As a convicted felon, Martin should not have possessed a weapon. When applying for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card in January 2014, he lied about his previous felony conviction for aggravated assault. After he purchased his pistol in March, Martin also applied for a concealed carry permit. When the fingerprinting process revealed Martin’s criminal history in Mississippi, police turned down Martin’s application, revoked his FOID card, and informed him that he must relinquish his weapon within 48 hours. Instead, Martin kept the pistol.
Non-compliance with police orders regarding weapons and FOID turnover is not uncommon. In 2018, 10,818 FOID cards were revoked by the Illinois State Police, who admitted on Monday that “in most instances” a weapon and official record are not returned. Law enforcement is able to petition a judge for a search warrant to retrieve guns that are not turned over, but according to Illinois law, they are not required to do so.
In Aurora, existing gun laws failed. In Parkland, a host of authorities and policies failed. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.
Pelosi’s threat of future gun control initiatives does not stand alone. During the 2018 midterm elections, more candidates aired “spots promot[ing] gun control than oppos[ing] it.” In the wake of the Aurora attack, Democratic presidential candidates are loudly decrying gun violence, and advocating for stricter gun control measures.
Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. Last Wednesday, while the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to require background checks on every gun sale or transfer, Democrats rejected Republicans’ efforts to add an amendment that would ensure law enforcement is notified “when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check.”
Most Americans Favor Legal Gun Ownership
A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. According to a March 2018 poll, 58 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “increase[s] public safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.”
James Craig, who returned to his native Detroit as its chief of police in June 2013, believes in the strength of a legally armed populace. After working as a police officer for nearly three decades in Los Angeles, “where ‘it took an act of Congress’ to get permission to carry a gun,” Craig transferred to Portland, Maine. There, he discovered a vastly safer city, and one where gun ownership was common. It was in Portland that Craig realized “the effect…good Americans who are armed can have on reducing violence.”
Prior to Craig’s arrival, Detroit was among the most violent cities in the country. According to FBI statistics, 80 in 1000 Detroit residents “became victims of violent or property crime each year.” In 2012, 386 criminal homicides had been reported in the city. To bring down crime rates, the new chief of police urged Detroit residents to legally and safely arm themselves.
In 2014, Craig’s department issued 1,100 handgun permits. That year, the number of home invasions decreased by 38 percent, with the numbers of shootings and robberies likewise decreasing. Of the 1,800 felons queried in a 2015 survey, 57 percent identified their biggest fear as “armed citizens.”
Since Craig took over the department, Detroit has experienced “double-digit drops” in “nonfatal shootings, robberies, and carjackings.” Although the city’s levels of violence still leave much to be desired, in 2017, Detroit recorded its “lowest number of homicides since 1966.”
Craig believes a conversation surrounding guns should not be about gun control, but “crime control.” As he explains, “individuals who are criminally inclined…when in possession of a weapon, create the problems.”
Before Democrats look to new measures of gun control, they should concern themselves with the enforcement of existing gun laws, keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, and holding accountable institutions and policies which allow threats to go undetected.
If Democrats impede law-abiding Americans from arming themselves to protect their fellow citizens, and themselves, then the only people with access to weapons will be those who purchase them illegally, with criminal intent.",['two-faced']

Because art, or something.
The exhibit, on display at CulturalDC’s former Flashpoint Gallery in Washington, D.C., is a piece of “performance art” where an Ivanka Trump lookalike wearing a pink dress with bows and stiletto shoes vacuums crumbs off a plush, pink carpet. To make the spectacle interactive, onlookers are encouraged to take crumbs from a pedestal and throw them at her to vacuum up.
“Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities – daughter, wife, mother, sister, model, working woman, blonde – Ivanka Vacuuming is simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary feminine icon; a portrait of our own relationship to that figure; and a questioning of our complicity in her role-playing,” a press release on the project reads. “The public is invited to throw crumbs onto the carpet, watching as Ivanka elegantly vacuums up the mess, her smile never wavering. This process repeats itself for the entire duration of the performance.”
The irony, of course, is that the exhibit reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against, oversexualizing Ivanka’s body and ignoring her hard work. (One can only imagine the feminist rage if it were, say, Michelle Obama on display.)
In addition to mocking Ivanka for her looks, the exhibit demeans the First Daughter’s success as a business woman and White House advisor to that of a woman with a vacuum—as if something’s wrong with that, too. Worse, in the process of shaming stay-at-home mothers, “Ivanka Vacuuming” encourages onlookers to throw trash at her. Again, because “art,” or something.
Therein lies the only interesting insight offered by artist Jennifer Rubell, who is of course female because no male could get away with such sexism masked as art.
“Here is what’s complicated: we enjoy throwing the crumbs for Ivanka to vacuum. That is the icky truth at the center of the work. It’s funny, it’s pleasurable, it makes us feel powerful, and we want to do it more,” Rubell said. “We like having the power to elicit a specific and certain response. Also, we know she’ll keep vacuuming whether we do it or not, so it’s not really our fault, right?”
Rubell is right that under President Donald Trump, Americans get a rise out of insulting the first daughter or anyone who dares to wear a MAGA hat. Therein lies the truth of this exhibit: There’s far more wrong with the person who revels in hurling trash at others than there is with the person who’s willing to pick it up.
Anyone who cares enough to go see “Ivanka Vacuuming” or watch the spectacle on its livestream is likely too blinded by his own hate to realize the joke of the whole thing is actually on them. It’s not Ivanka’s vacuuming that’s the problem, but the heart of the person who feels pleasure from bullying and humiliating others.
It’s more than “icky” to feel this way. It’s immoral. That is why, for “Ivanka Vacuuming,” the real exhibit worth going to see is the people throwing the crumbs, not the person picking them up.","['mocking', 'demeans']"

This was not the president’s first gesture of warmth in the wake of Limbaugh’s sad revelation. The president took to Twitter to cheer him on, saying, “Many people do not know what a great guy & fantastic political talent the great Rush Limbaugh is. There is nobody like him.

The two men are known to be friendly and frequently golf together at Mar-a-lago. But apart from their friendship, Trump should feel a great bond with Limbaugh. After all, without his three decades of on-air bombast, bluster, and fearless defense of his audience, there likely would not be a President Trump.
Although few could have known it then, Limbaugh seems to have been the voice calling out in the wilderness, preparing America for a Trump presidency. As America came to love Limbaugh, it would soon come to love Trump. Here are four ways Limbaugh paved Trump’s way to the White House.
1. Not Accepting the DC Elite’s Excuses
When Republican lawmakers had every excuse for not defeating or repealing Obamacare after promising to do so for a decade, Limbaugh wasn’t hearing any of it. “In the past, we’ve gotten lip service…but if you listen carefully, you’ll hear them say, ‘Well we actually can’t. Yeah, we want to repeal it, but it would be very tough to do, and besides, we can’t really do it until we get the White House back…’”
Limbaugh called these excuses out for what they were: a smokescreen for thwarting the will of the people. In some cases, that’s even meant Limbaugh not taking excuses from Trump himself. When Trump signed the massive omnibus spending bill in 2018, Limbaugh gave the president flak for it. Both men see that Washington’s “business as usual” has done little for the average American, so both balk at the ways of Washington’s deep state elite.
2. Bringing Big Ideas Home for Average Americans
When Limbaugh first went on the air 32 years ago, it was unheard of that a conservative commentator would fill three hours of air time with few phone calls and almost no guests. Instead, it was just one guy with a microphone, an opinion and guts.
People were transfixed. Limbaugh educated a generation of casually conservative voters about the fundamental principles and concepts behind their beliefs. Especially to Boomers, he took conservative principles out of the Buckley-esque ivory tower and put them where they mattered: in their daily lives.
While no one is praising Trump as a thought leader in the way Limbaugh has been, he’s undeniably made conservative ideas tangible for average Americans. In the chants “Lock her up” or “Build a wall,” he may not be quoting Cato, but he’s making a connection between policy and Americans’ everyday lives.
3. Cutting Through B.S. with Surgical Accuracy
If Limbaugh and Trump shared a mantra, it would be, “Sorry, not sorry.” They call them like they see them and don’t flinch. One of Limbaugh’s signature moves is taking down opposing opinions with both bravado and merciless logic. Sure, he might dress down a liberal caller as a “cheap bastard,” but not without eloquently explaining why his argument on the minimum wage is wrong.
Long before the Trump “Access Hollywood” tape was a gleam in CNN’s eye, the liberal media jumped on Limbaugh in 2012 for calling a female law student a “slut” and “prostitute” for advocating for employer-funded birth control. While Limbaugh did apologize for the personal insults, he stood by the nerve he struck.
Americans heard the left arguing that unlimited birth control, paid for by taxpayers, is a fundamental right. As he does, Rush called B.S., and his fans cheered. Such a masterful takedown would not be seen again until the 2016 election, when Donald Trump called nonsense on Elizabeth Warren’s bogus Native American heritage, dubbing her “Pocahontas.”
4. Reassuring Americans Their Values Are Worth Upholding
Like Trump, sadly Limbaugh’s private life sometimes runs counter to conservative ideals. He’s been married multiple times. He came out publicly about his addiction to prescription painkillers in 2003, struggling for several years after with relapses, drug charges, and stints in rehab. Still, his audience was fiercely loyal.
In both Limbaugh and Trump’s cases, their public has forgiven them sins that would have destroyed many others. In fact, many choir boys rush to their defense. Why? Because they are a powerful voice that defends their audience’s right to believe as they do and not be judged for it.
In a too-perfect example, comedian Al Franken once wrote a book titled “Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot.” It’s true that Franken eventually became a senator, but both Limbaugh and Franken have faced very public accusations of sexism. Today, only one of them still has a successful public career—and it’s not Franken.
Ultimately, Limbaugh and Trump are loved and hated for the same reason: because they’re successful. Limbaugh revolutionized talk radio and spawned a generation of fierce conservatives.
Some people hate Trump and mock everything from his geography gaffes to his appearance. They’ve done the same thing with Rush. All of this mockery and vitriol is just an attempt to thwart their real success in revolutionizing American culture and politics. But just as Limbaugh has succeeded, so will Trump—because they, not their adversaries, understand what makes America tick.","['mockery', 'vitriol', 'revolutionizing']"
"H.R. 8, as well as other new gun control legislation currently being considered by the House Democrat majority do not accomplish the goal of reducing gun violence.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-steve-scalise-democrats-dont-want-you-to-hear-what-i-have-to-say-about-guns-and-the-second-amendment,federalist,gun-control,right,52.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing Wednesday on new gun control legislation Democrats plan to push on the American people. The top Republican on the committee, Doug Collins, R-Ga., asked committee Democrats if I could testify about this legislation in an appropriate setting to offer another perspective as both a survivor of a shooting attack and strong supporter of our Second Amendment rights. But the Democrats said no. While liberals may try to silence conservative voices, I will not be silenced. The American people deserve to hear all perspectives. Here is the testimony I planned to give:
Statement for the Record
Republican Whip Steve Scalise
House Committee on the Judiciary
February 6, 2019
My name is Steve Scalise. I am the Congressman for Louisiana’s 1st District. I am the Republican Whip. I am also a target of gun violence.
Many of you may be familiar with the events of June 14, 2017. Around 7:00 AM, at the last morning practice before the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity, an Illinois man named James Hodgkinson opened fire on myself and a group of Republican legislators and volunteers on an Alexandria, Va. baseball field.
REP. STEVE SCALISE: ‘PLEASE GOD, LET ME SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN’ – WHAT WENT THROUGH MY MIND THE DAY I WAS SHOT
Fortunately, as a member of House leadership, I was accompanied by my Capitol Police security detail who were able to return fire and engage the shooter until additional law enforcement officers arrived and ultimately took down the shooter. I was shot and nearly fatally wounded, and both of my detail agents were shot as well. I am alive today thanks to the bravery of U.S. Capitol Police and the Alexandria Police, heroes like Congressman Brad Wenstrup and the first responders who rushed to the scene, the incredible medical team at Washington MedStar Hospital Center, and most importantly the grace of God.
I applaud the intentions behind this hearing and believe we are all pursuing the same goal of reducing gun violence. As someone who experienced gun violence, I do not want anyone else to go through that trauma. However, it is also important to me that we be honest with ourselves and the American people about what will -- or won’t -- actually prevent these tragedies. The shooter who targeted me that morning was armed with an SKS rifle and a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun, both of which were purchased in compliance with Illinois gun laws.
The new gun control restrictions currently being considered by the Democratic majority in H.R. 8 would not have prevented my shooting.
In fact, these new gun control measures being proposed in H.R. 8 would not have prevented any number of recent mass violence events. Several perpetrators of recent multi-victim shootings also purchased their guns legally. In some instances, the background check system failed, and lack of intervention from law enforcement failed to intercept potential threats.
I want to stress that the man who shot me was issued a permit to purchase firearms by the state of Illinois, and had acquired them legally. At Virginia Tech, Charleston, and Sutherland Springs failures in the background check system allowed individuals to illegally obtain the firearms they used to commit their crimes. The alleged loopholes that H.R. 8 claims to fix would not have prevented these tragedies either.
Instead, whether intentionally or not, the gun control proposals in H.R. 8 could turn law abiding citizens into criminals while also failing to achieve the stated purpose of reducing gun violence.
A recent study by the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis and Johns Hopkins University into California’s effort to implement “comprehensive background checks” found that, “The simultaneous implementation of [the Comprehensive Background Check policy] and [prohibitions on firearm purchase and possession for persons convicted within the past 10 years of certain violent crimes classified as misdemeanors] was not associated with a net change in the firearm homicide rate over the ensuing 10 years in California.” Even though California implemented more stringent background checks, this study shows that these measures did not reduce gun violence.
In fact, most criminals obtain firearms through unlawful means -- whether through theft, straw purchases, or lying on the required paperwork. A DOJ study of federal inmates found that only seven percent who possessed a firearm while committing the crime they were serving time for purchased it legally from a firearms dealer under their own name. Based on similar gun control measures in states like California, H.R. 8 would not deter a criminal from engaging in criminal activity, and it won’t decrease gun crime. Instead, it only succeeds in limiting the ways that law-abiding citizens could exercise their Second Amendment rights.
Every single month in America, law-abiding citizens with concealed carry permits defend themselves and others against criminals who have guns. For example, on January 8th, a man approached a 25-year-old woman in Chicago, displayed a weapon, and attempted to rob her at a bus stop. The woman had a concealed carry permit. She drew her own weapon and fired a shot, killing the armed robber. The owner of a nearby pharmacy said such violence happens “all over” Chicago. However, in this case, the intended victim was able to defend herself with her own gun.
On January 2nd, a Good Samaritan in California with a concealed carry permit used his firearm to stop an attempted stabbing of a security guard and held the perpetrator until law enforcement could arrive at the scene.
On January 17th, a man at an IHOP in Alabama opened fire on employees, killing one before another employee pulled his handgun and killed the shooter in self-defense.
On January 29th, an armed robber held up a Family Dollar Store in Georgia. A customer was able to use a personal firearm to shoot and kill the robber before the criminal could hurt any of the many employees or customers in the store.
These are just some examples from the last month alone. There are hundreds of stories like these every single year from law-abiding Americans all over the country.
I am alive due to the effective and immediate response of my Capitol Police detail, and the Alexandria Police Department. Most victims of gun violence do not have law enforcement already on the scene to respond to a violent gunman. Instead of making it harder for citizens to defend themselves until law enforcement arrives, Congress should consider legislation like H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill that would help law-abiding citizens have the same tools to defend themselves as a criminal has of trying to inflict harm, regardless of where they travel.
I firmly believe we must never forget, nor minimize, the importance of the Second Amendment to our Constitution.
H.R. 8, as well as other new gun control legislation currently being considered by the House Democrat majority do not accomplish the goal of reducing gun violence.

If our goal is to reduce gun violence, then we should focus on penalizing criminals, not law-abiding citizens.

"The First Amendment forbids the establishment of a state church in the United States, but it in no way imposes the incoherent burden of religious neutrality on our civic institutions",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/13/need-christian-nationalism-religious-neutrality-failed/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,52.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Our religious liberty never proceeded from attempts at religious neutrality. It came precisely from the privileged position that Christianity has historically held in America and in the West.
A gaggle of representatives from theologically liberal denominations recently issued a statement against Christian nationalism in America, claiming that it threatens both American democracy and the ability of our religious communities to live in peace.
To be sure, Christian nationalism is an extremely odd place to find the threat to religious freedom in a world that increasingly makes demands like “shut up and wax that woman’s b-lls.” But the irony goes deeper than that. It’s not some stroke of blind chance that lead to religious freedom in the Christian West—it was, in fact, due to our Christian faith.
To be sure, although I know self-described Christian nationalists, I’m aware of no organized political movement for this statement to oppose and so, no standard definition. Nevertheless, I have never found the label to apply to some of what the statement opposes—calls for theocracy, a conflation of American and Christian identities, and certainly not a “cover for white supremacy,” which the statement tosses in to poison the well. I’ve no interest in contending on behalf of such things.
Nevertheless, until “Christian nationalism” coalesces into something more definitive, in my experience the phrase best describes something much simpler: a rejection of the religious neutrality of the late 20th century in favor of 1) a recognition that Christianity has had a unique and privileged influence on our American heritage that overshadows the influences of other faith traditions, 2) a conviction that a Christian understanding of the world should predominate over other worldviews in American civic life, and 3) an understanding that a nation that successfully excised or sufficiently diluted this influence could no longer be called “American” in the same sense as before. Although more general than what the statement condemns, this understanding would actually encompass many Americans, whether they accept the label or not.
Regardless of its other issues, the statement’s crosshairs certainly fall squarely on this simpler understanding as well. The statements condemns the preference for one religion over another, expresses the irrelevancy of religion for civic standing, and contends for all manner of religious neutrality in American civic life.
But our religious liberty never proceeded from attempts at religious neutrality. It came precisely from the privileged position that Christianity has historically held in America and in the West.
Early States Established Churches with Tax Support
The First Amendment forbids the establishment of a state church in the United States, but it in no way imposes the incoherent burden of religious neutrality on our civic institutions, nor demands that the right to free exercise of religion end when one crosses from private life into the public sphere. We are already experiencing the erosion of religious liberties that these erroneous presumptions have caused, with Christian business owners and officials forced to promulgate ideas they abhor and facilitate celebrations that are incompatible with the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Today, when the American left speaks about religious freedom at all, it speaks in terms of “freedom of worship” rather than of free exercise. But freedom of worship is nothing more than the right to go into a private building and follow one’s preferred liturgy on any day of the week so long as it is out of the public view.
The right of free exercise of religion cannot end there, for no religion on earth ends there. Life is a series of choices in which we each decide what’s most important to us. As we order these priorities, every knee eventually bows to something more important than the rest—the “god” we consider to be the Most Important Thing. Whatever the specific details of one’s god, the very nature of a god is that it is supreme—it lays claim to one’s entire life rather than merely one’s private life.
This is true regardless of whether one follows a traditional religion or even refers to one’s highest value as a “god” at all. Even the hedonist, whose god is personal pleasure, does not leave his worship of pleasure behind when he enters the public sphere. If he refrains from certain pursuits in the public eye, it is only because such restraint will net him more pleasure in the long run. Pleasure therefore remains the god that dictates his public activities.
So it is also with the Christian, the Muslim, the secular humanist, and the utilitarian. So when the follower of a god enters into civic life—as anything from a simple voter all the way up to president—he does not and cannot cease following that god. He will instead look to what that god demands of someone who holds the positions he occupies.
Different gods make different demands. One of the reasons theological liberals are so blind on this issue is their ignorant presumption that, at their root, all religions are basically the same—that they all worship the same God, proclaim the same general values and ideals, and merely have different cultural trappings or modes of expression. In such a fantasy, a neutral pluralism is conceivable, but reality is a different matter.
Although there is only one God, there are many gods (i.e., idols) in this world. The extent to which a person will support or even accept things like secular democracy and religious pluralism depends on that person’s god.
Apply This to Today’s Public Life
What then does that mean for American democracy and religious freedom? It means neither can ever be religiously neutral. Some gods demand such things; some gods merely tolerate them; and other gods abhor them. To embrace these things as worthy of our support and protection and prioritize them over other concerns is to favor some gods and therefore some religions above others.
Rather than submitting to a fantasy of religious neutrality, Christian nationalism accepts and adapts to this reality. After all, the Christian faith is the root from which our form of religious freedom grew, and the American nation is the heritage in which it is enfleshed. The positive forms of secularism and religious liberty that had been enjoyed in America grew out of the specifics of Christianity.
Christians, for example, have always held that there is a fundamental distinction between worldly government and the kingdom of heaven. Even the statement acknowledges this. You can see it in the teachings of Jesus—that his kingdom was not of this world, and that we should render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s.
You can see it in St. Augustine, when he wrote of the City of Man and the City of God. You can see it in Martin Luther’s Two Kingdoms theology. You can see it in the Church of Rome’s doctrine of the Two Swords. Different Christian traditions have certainly differed as to how these two realms relate to one another, and some have separated them far more than others. Nevertheless, the distinction has always been there. Civil government can be disentangled from the church precisely because of that Christian distinction.
Every Religion Doesn’t Do Separation of Church and State
But not every religion makes that distinction. Islam, for example, is both a religion and a political ideology. It makes no real distinction between the two. The idea of the Ummah that Muhammad left his followers—a united religious community that transcends tribe and would one day encompass the entire world—has nothing within it to encourage secularism.
Even the simple idea that church and state have distinct authorities and responsibilities is by no means religious neutral.
Political conquest is Muhammad’s legacy because he explicitly commanded it of his devotees, and he established a sharia to which everyone is supposed to submit. According to Muhammad, a pertinent distinction among religions in the world is between Dar al Islam and Dar al Harb (the House of Islam and the House of War).
So in the end, even the simple idea that church and state have distinct authorities and responsibilities is by no means religious neutral. It blatantly gives Christianity a seat of privilege in the way government is organized, and it does so at the expense of some other religions.
The same can be said of American religious freedom. Americans have deliberately refrained from establishing a state church, and we allow extremely broad freedoms for the exercise of religion and the expression of religious ideas. This was a natural outgrowth of Christian ideas, since in Christianity, salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ—a faith that cannot be compelled by force. Accordingly, from the Christian perspective, there is very little point in using the state to enforce religious adherence.
Now, I’m neither claiming that Christians have always respected this reality nor that we’re the only ones who have. But this is precisely where the nationalism comes into the mix.
Western Toleration Comes from Christianity’s Growth
The Western tendency to tolerate different creeds proceeded from the blood and chaos that different Christians inflicted on one another during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. It took considerable time and effort to accept this understanding and begin teaching our governments to loosen their grip on the religious habits of their citizens. This effort hinged on the experiences of many different groups of Christians who sought out places where they could freely adhere to their creeds.
So our religious freedom is not simply an abstract ideal floating in the ether, but a heritage—a specifically Christian one. It is precisely English Christians of that sort who learned this very Christian lesson and brought it with them to this land, where they eventually grew into their own Christian nation. It was also those Christians who decided to extend that Christian freedom to the believers on other creeds.
Our religious freedom is not simply an abstract ideal floating in the ether, but a heritage—a specifically Christian one.
Nevertheless, extending that freedom to other faiths never made it religiously neutral. On the contrary, we embedded our religious understanding of such freedom into the way we governed—blatantly privileging Christianity over other religions.
After all, in most other religions, goodness—however it may be conceived—proceeds from a person’s works as much or more than from his faith. State requirements to make the right sacrifices, participate in the right ceremonies, or live in the proper manner make a great deal more sense in other religions. Likewise, religions that demand the infidels be slaughtered wherever they may be found tend to be far less willing to allow those infidels the same kind of freedoms.
So even when America decides to allow the free exercise of all religions, that very decision privileges religions like Christianity, which are more focused on faith than on following specific laws. This can be seen in the way that free exercise has been judged through our history. In a post-9/11 world, it’s become abundantly clear that even flying planes into buildings can be an exercise of religion.
Where Religious Neutrality Ends
Nevertheless, though we put no prohibition on free exercise per se, we always drew the line at publicly immoral behaviors even when those behaviors are also religious duties for some. Certain faiths, for example, have explicitly allowed or encouraged bigamy, but for most of our history, this was never seriously considered an allowable matter of free exercise.
Not every religion sees the matter the same way. Not every religion even has a natural law tradition.
In decisions like that, the state was not and cannot be morally neutral, any more than it was or can be religiously neutral. In every decision, it weighs one set of goods against another and decides which is of more value.
In America, the weight of those past decisions have always been rooted in the values of the Christians who founded and cultivated this nation. Their substance is indelibly colored by Christianity. Our Declaration of Independence hinges the entire matter of independence on the “Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” and ascribes our rights to endowment by the Creator.
These are by no means religiously neutral statements. They are not sectarian, grounded as they are in the language of natural law, but they are nevertheless grounded in a Christian understanding of that natural law. Not every religion sees the matter the same way. Not every religion even has a natural law tradition.
Common Objections Don’t Hold Water
Some would object to this line of thought, claiming that our nation really founded as much by deists rather than Christians. There were certainly a few prominent ones in the mix, but it doesn’t weaken my case in the slightest.
No nation is beholden to religious neutrality, no matter what freedoms it grants.
Deism itself was always an attempt to possess a Christian heritage without possessing a Christian faith. What’s more, the reason deism went defunct so quickly is that this attempt was almost immediately found to be a fool’s errand. The only remaining progeny of deism are those who returned to Christianity and those who proceeded down the road to atheism. Inasmuch as deists contributed to the founding of this nation, they were still operating under the inertia of the Christian heritage they had received.
Others would claim that our religious liberty is no longer Christian because many non-Christian nations have also provided measures of religious freedom. This is true, and I’m quite pleased that they’ve culturally appropriated religious liberty from the Christian West. I believe my heritage to be of value, so I think it’s great when others learn from it.
But that appropriation does not change where our own liberty came from. Neither does it change the fact that these other nations have modified religious liberty according to their own religious understandings. Israel, for example, allows for a great deal of religious liberty, but it is no more religiously neutral than America is. After all, simply believing that Jesus Christ is the messiah voids the right of return granted by Israel to other ethnic Jews. No nation is beholden to religious neutrality, no matter what freedoms it grants.
The Habit of Toleration Can Go Too Far
To be sure, our more recent history has seen a remarkable shift away from our Christian heritage and its moral wisdom. Under the guise of religious neutrality, too many Christians have been tricked into withholding their good judgment from matters of state. This has led to some profound changes, but there’s nothing religiously or morally neutral about them.
We have, for instance, allowed women to choose whether to murder their offspring, but this is not neutrality—in this, the state blatantly values personal autonomy and privacy more than it values love or the right to live. We have forced people to speak as though men are actually women or act as though two women can be married to one-another, but this is not neutral—it demands that Christians set aside their understanding of marriage and sex. Even something as simple as getting rid of blasphemy laws that respected the name of Jesus Christ was never “fair” or neutral—it only cleared the way for new blasphemy laws that respect sexual deviancy and other politically correct subjects du jour instead.
Christian nationalism is rising precisely because more and more Christians are realizing that we’ve been lied to on the matter. We were persuaded to set aside our heritage in public based on a faulty notion of neutrality and the expectation that everyone else would do the same. But everyone else has done no such thing, and we should never have expected or asked them to. We allowed our religious values to be replaced by others’ religious values and, unsurprisingly, have little to show for our foolishness.
If you Think Christianity Is Valuable, You’re a Nationalist
Christian nationalism is not an attempt to requisition the state to teach Christian theology—it would be even less competent at this than it is at all other types of education. Neither is it in any way an incitement to the largely hypothetical violence over which the statement’s authors wring their hands.
It is simply American Christians who believe that their religion is true and their nation valuable contending for their own convictions about goodness, truth, and beauty rather than for others’. We are not “merging” our two identities, as the statement alleges, but holding onto both of them in everything that we do.
Far from destroying American democracy and religious liberty, Christian nationalism embodies the very same spirit that built that heritage of ours in the first place.","['incoherent', 'burden']"

"After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/29/white-pride-creepy-black-pride-isnt/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,53.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Is it wrong to take pride in being white? This is not meant as a trick question, but it might be a little tricky. Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white.
There’s a complication, though. If whites can’t take pride in our ethnicity, is it okay for blacks or Hispanics to have ethnic pride? Our society looks on that kind of boosterism with a much more tolerant eye. What’s the difference? Have we so succumbed to the siren song of privilege theory that white people are the only ones left who are not allowed to feel good about ourselves?
That Damned ‘Invisible Backpack’
As David Marcus explained in this insightful essay, privilege theory is indeed a real problem. It helped re-awaken tribal loyalties that would have been better left shifting in their shallow graves. Everyone is better off when whites don’t think too much about their whiteness. It should be normal without being normative, and regular without being right. It’s having a one-story house. It’s writing in black pen. It’s Times New Roman.
Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman. They poked and they prodded, and eventually got the resentful backlash they were provoking. Privilege theory has done real damage, and white liberals should be assessing their mistakes. Nevertheless, it’s hard to believe that privilege theory is the only culprit.
When higher allegiances break down, lower ones become more prominent. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, and that involves finding reasons to align yourself with this group of people, instead of that other one. Group allegiances are not necessarily an excuse for hatred or bigotry (although they can give rise to those evils). They’re about belonging somewhere, and having people you can turn to when the road gets rocky. People need that.
It’s no secret that Trumpism and the alt-right have found their strongest footholds in places where social and economic breakdown are the worst. Family structures break down, church communities dwindle, the economy sags, and ethno-nationalism becomes more appealing.
Proud to Be a (White) American?
Is Trumpism racist? It’s been a contentious question of late. While it’s perfectly evident that Trump does have racist supporters (which he is suspiciously reluctant to condemn), many contend that Trumpism is itself not racist, but merely a justified reaction to the Left’s racial patronage. All Trump’s supporters really want is a properly colorblind society.
It’s not a terribly convincing argument because, among other reasons, Trumpism so obviously represents a desperate cry for group recognition and a demand for group patronage. How has the market been good for us? Bring back our jobs. Even the “America first” motto is clearly focused on a particular vision of America that only a minority of its citizens seem to share.
We may be reaching the point where we need to define more carefully what “racism” really means. To that end, the rhetoric of the alt-right may perhaps be worth examining as an indicator of what some of our “white boosters” are thinking nowadays. There’s admittedly some distance between ordinary Trump supporters and alt-right quasi-intellectuals, but the latter have clearly attracted a non-trivial following in the Trump camp. Alt-rightism shouldn’t be lazily dismissed as a totally detached, insane fringe. It has hit a chord with many ordinary Americans, thriving on the mainstream’s predictable preference for shunning its arguments instead of answering them.
Many alt-right thinkers are willing to argue openly that race matters, that genetics play a non-trivial role in the progression of cultures, and that race is naturally a deep component of personal identity. These arguments can get a lot of oxygen in a world already obsessed with race. Liberals have had their identity politics parties and now alt-righters want theirs, which they expect will be truly amazing because they are in possession of western culture, the best cultural heritage there is.
Conquering Western Civilization
Hear them roar! Alt-righters love to talk about how smart and strong and savvy they are. (Fun game: count the number of times this article brags about those smarty-pants alt-righters and their incredible intellectual heft.) They usually get away with it because they surround themselves with amateurs, who are unprepared for their juvenile jibes. After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler.
Try again, Hayes. Don’t validate the white supremacist’s claim to own Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Boetheus, Bonaventure, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Milton, Da Vinci, Tolstoy, Columbus, Newton, our Founding Fathers and alright, yes, possibly Hitler. Instead, ask him to justify his emphasis on whiteness as a cornerstone of western thought.
Undoubtedly, white men feature prominently among the heroes and visionaries of the West, and it’s reasonable to conclude on those grounds that white men can’t just be natural degenerates, as some liberals seem to suppose. Still, the greatness of the Western tradition doesn’t lie in its whiteness and maleness. It lies in its breadth, adaptability, and universality.
Terence, great playwright of the Roman Republic, told us “I am a man; nothing human is alien from me.” St. Paul told us that in Christ, “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female.” The great thinkers of the high Middle Ages were intensely focused on the human condition, not the Italian or French or male condition. No student of the Western canon ever pauses in the middle of “City of God” to ask, “Wasn’t St. Monica born in Northern Africa? Why are we reading this Augustine clown?”
In short, the Western ethos at its best is profoundly un-tribal. To claim this rich tradition specifically for whites, therefore, is to muddy it and betray its core tenets. American whites can absolutely take pride in their Western heritage. They came from the old world and settled this immense, wild place, extending the great traditions of their forefathers to a whole new land. But if we’re going to take pride in our Western heritage, we should understand that legacy calls for transcending xenophobic ethno-nationalism. We shouldn’t need that, and we have something much better.
The downside of the glorious Western tradition, though, is that its perversion can be ugly, raising dreams of totalitarian domination. (Now a Hitler reference would be acceptable.) Especially here in America, a young nation founded by old-world immigrants with classically liberal commitments, there just isn’t a healthy or grounded way to take pride in whiteness per se.
Slouching Towards Bethlehem
Let’s return to the title question. Why is white pride creepy when black pride isn’t? Shouldn’t we have to choose between a universal ethic of colorblindness, and one that endorses ethnic tribalism at least to some degree?
It turns out that white pride really is categorically different. To understand why, though, we have to think carefully about traditions and their role in lives and cultures. Melanin levels are not in themselves a significant indicator of human character or worth, and whites are not morally inferior (or superior) to any other ethnic group. Nevertheless, cultures do matter, and it could be that “white culture” just isn’t a healthy or organic phenomenon in the way that black culture is or at least can be.
Ethnic pride really isn’t a necessary feature of a healthy psychology, but it can be acceptable when attached to a meaningful tradition that also imposes expectations and requirements. Most of us have probably known kids from Asian backgrounds whose elders are constantly reminding them that their behavior and work ethic will reflect back on their family and clan. That ethos definitely seems to contain an element of ethnic pride. However, it’s incorporated into a tradition and community ethos in such a way as to be a mostly positive influence.
Black pride is connected to a minority subculture that developed in response to intense historical oppression. For most of American history, the non-integration of blacks into mainstream culture was imposed from the outside, so taking offense over the existence of a distinct black subculture would hardly be reasonable. (Of course it doesn’t follow that this culture should be impervious to critique.) It’s an authentic tradition that incorporated an ethnic element for extremely understandable historical reasons. Something similar could be said of most Native American traditions.
Blacks and Native Americans, as the most obviously oppressed ethnic groups in our nation’s history, have also been the most averse to mainstream integration. Other ethnic groups tend to be absorbed more organically into mainstream American culture with the second, third, and fourth generations. They may retain a certain cultural distinctiveness in their names, diets, or cultural festivals, but insofar as they do stand apart, these groups generally adhere to traditions that are substantive enough to keep megalomaniacal urges in check. Ethnic pride isn’t just an entitlement; it’s also an expectation.
Will the Real Cuckservatives Please Stand Up?
White pride really doesn’t have an honorable tradition to call its own. Its claims on Western culture are tenuous, and none of the other reference points (segregation and skinheads) are particularly admirable. So it really does seem reasonable to say that whiteness, although in no way shameful, is not per se a healthy source of pride.
Viewing the matter in this light, it’s somewhat unsurprising that our alt-right partisans actually seem to pride themselves on being brainy rebels and devil-may-care pranksters. They’re not traditionalists in any normal sense, because they stand outside the circle of ordinary civil discourse, and even take joy in the fact. They’re what happens when traditionalism meets expressive individualism, in a world with too many resentful loners and not enough churches. They brilliantly combine the worst of cosmopolitanism (its rootlessness) with the worst of provincialism (its narrow-minded tribalism).
Just as much as the progressives they loathe, alt-righters are the bad fruit of a collapsing culture, taking pride in whiteness because they’re too alienated from more-substantive cultural institutions (family, church, community) to find a more fitting link to their Western forbears. Will the real cuckservatives please stand up? I don’t think it’s the Paul Ryans of the world who are disgracing the legacy of the West.
As every literate conservative has now realized, the collapse of Middle America is one of the great challenges that faces our society in the present moment. We need to rebuild our families and our cultural institutions so people of all backgrounds can find meaningful community and personal identity. White pride is a bad starting point, however. Let’s not sell our Western heritage for a mess of identity-politics pottage.","['offensive', 'idiotic', 'remark', 'predictably', 'Hitler', 'Western', 'civilization']"
The National Republican Senatorial Committee slammed Senate Democrats for blocking the legislation.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/22/democrats-block-senate-coronavirus-package/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,53.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would provide economic relief to businesses and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Senate GOP package failed, with 47 votes in favor and 47 against, which fell 13 votes short of what was necessary to advance the legislation.
An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package.
“I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” the Senate leader said on Sunday.
McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.”
“She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.”
In contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blamed Republicans for advancing legislation without an agreement.
Schumer said on the Senate floor:
The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing. So who’s playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we’re committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee slammed Senate Democrats for blocking the legislation.
NRSC Communications Director said in a statement on Sunday:
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats allowed partisan fervor to thwart a critical coronavirus relief package while our country faces a crippling pandemic. DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren’t beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats’ unthinkable decision to filibuster.
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said in a statement on Sunday:
‪How pathetic. Tonight’s vote was not even on passing a bipartisan plan, it was merely to begin debating it. The American people are hurting, the clock is ticking, but Senate Democrats would rather cave to Speaker Pelosi’s eleventh-hour demands. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should worry more about getting relief to their constituents and less about the House Speaker’s partisan wish list. This cannot go another day.
After congressional Republicans and Democrats were in the final stages of negotiating a long-term coronavirus package deal with the White House, Pelosi announced that House Democrats will move forward with their own bill.
“From my standpoint, we’re apart,” she said earlier on Sunday.

Trump kicked off his second day on the subcontinent with an elaborate outdoor welcome ceremony in front of the grand Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential Palace in New Delhi.
Cannons fired as the president's armored car, nicknamed ""The Beast,"" rolled through the palace gates accompanied by a parade of red-uniformed guards on horseback. The ceremony included hundreds of military officials, marching with instruments and swords, as well as an official greeting by India's president and its prime minister, Narendra Modi.

A day earlier in New Delhi, at least seven people, including a police officer, were killed and dozens were injured in clashes between hundreds of supporters and opponents of a new citizenship law in India that provides fast-track naturalization for some foreign-born religious minorities but not Muslims, police said Tuesday.
There were no protests in New Delhi on Tuesday, when Modi hosted Trump at Hyderabad House in the capital for the official portion of the president's visit to India.
“The last two days were amazing in every sense of the word,"" Trump said as he and Modi briefly addressed reporters. Trump said progress was being made on trade, fighter-jet purchases and energy.
Modi said he was thankful Trump visited despite the presidential campaign underway in the United States. Trump has said the short India visit was partly due to presidential politics.
“I know that it’s busy time for you in the United States,” Modi told Trump. ""But despite that, you accepted an invitation to visit India. I welcome you and your delegation.”
The leaders were also expected to announce an arms deal Tuesday as part of Trump's jam-packed day in the Indian capital that will include a joint statement with Modi, meetings with business leaders and embassy officials, a solo news conference and an opulent state dinner before the president heads back to Washington.
But Trump has made clear that little progress is expected on the trade front, despite rising tensions between the countries after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium exports. India responded with higher penalties on U.S. agricultural goods and restrictions on medical devices, prompting the U.S. to strip India of its decades-old trade preferences.
Trump told reporters Monday that he's in “no rush” for a trade agreement with India.
Eyes also will be on whether Trump will criticize Modi over the new citizenship law, which has raised fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Trump typically refrains from publicly rebuking world leaders for human rights abuses during his overseas trips. He spoke at length on Monday about measures his administration had taken to combat the threat of “radical Islamic terrorism.”
TRUMP RECEIVES WARM WELCOME IN INDIA
During Monday's protests, police fired tear gas and used canes as they charged at the protesters in several districts of New Delhi. The rival groups hurled rocks at each other and set some houses, shops, vehicles and a gasoline pump on fire. Police closed access to two metro stations in the area.
Trump's comments came during a mega-rally in the world's largest cricket stadium — part of an elaborate welcome for a president who revels in pomp and pageantry.
Trump joked Tuesday that the crowd had been there more for Modi than for him, saying people cheered every time he mentioned Modi's name.
“So they love you in India and that's a good thing.,” Trump said.
Everywhere he went on Monday, Trump was greeted by thousands of cheering Indian citizens, troops of traditional dancers and roadways lined with posters and billboards celebrating his visit. Trump and first lady Melania Trump also went on a stunning sunset tour of the famed Taj Mahal.

On January 8, 2019, Breitbart News reported that House Democrats introduced legislation to criminalize private gun sales. They are using universal background checks as a means of criminalizing the sales, and they do not mention such checks are unenforceable without firearm registration.
Instead, the Democrats keep talking of how their bill will “prevent” or reduce “gun violence.”
Politico quoted Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) saying:
Since the shooting at Sandy Hook, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has been fighting for a chance to pass legislation that will help save lives. Finally, with our new majority that ran on helping to prevent gun violence, we will introduce a bipartisan, universal background checks bill. We will hold hearings, we will have a vote, and this legislation will finally pass the House.
But the reality is that universal background checks open the door to a gun registry inasmuch as the government has to know every gun owners’ name and the guns he or she owns in order for the checks to work.
Think about it — universal background checks require that Americans get permission from the government before buying a gun in any setting, retail or private. This means the government knows every time a gun changes hands, and this includes knowing the name of the buyer and the seller, of the make and caliber of the gun, etc. But the only way the government can know these things is to know exactly who owns guns — and what guns he or she owns — at every moment of every day.
Breitbart News reported the relationship between universal background checks and gun registration on April 14, 2013, when the Democrats were pushing the checks as a response to the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. Breitbart News noted that “The government has to know where every gun is in order to know that [one neighbor] is not selling a gun to [another] neighbor.”
House Democrats are not currently pushing a firearm registry, but without a complete knowledge of the location of all firearms, universal background checks simply will not work. So registration will have to be added down the road if universal background checks are passed now. And California’s example teaches us that confiscation will follow the establishment of universal checks and firearm registration.

A U-turn, an angry president and a fateful walk to a churchBy ROBERT BURNSAP National Security WriterThe Associated PressWASHINGTON
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Mark Esper was three blocks from the FBI’s Washington field office. He had planned to confer there at a security command center, but plans changed with an unexpected call to divert immediately.
Go the White House. President Donald Trump wanted a briefing from him and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on how the military was handling security as protests grew on the streets of the nation’s capital.
Esper’s driver pulled a U-turn in the middle of the street and flipped on the flashing lights, and they rushed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
It was late afternoon on Monday, June 1 — one of the more consequential days of Donald Trump’s presidency, when he was forced to reckon with rapidly swelling demonstrations after George Floyd’s death in the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
This account of Trump’s decision-making, based on a senior defense official as well as several others in the Trump administration, offers insight into how the president was pushing for the fastest, most extreme measures while advisers at the Pentagon tried to persuade him to take a more moderate approach.
The officials asked that their names not be used to describe sensitive deliberations.
At an Oval Office meeting late Monday morning, tempers were flaring. Trump and some of his senior aides wanted federal troops on the streets, and fast.
Some Washington businesses had been vandalized Sunday night and St. John’s Church, near the White House, had sustained fire damage. Trump was unhappy. Some governors, and local authorities in the District of Columbia, were not doing enough to stop violence, Trump believed.
By Monday morning he was considering a dramatic move — invoking the Insurrection Act so that he could use federal troops to enforce the law.
According to a senior defense official, Trump wanted 10,000 federal troops immediately on the streets to control a situation some aides believed could escalate dangerously.
Esper and Milley, however, argued against calling out the active-duty forces, fearful that it would militarize a problem that should be handled by civilian law enforcement. Violent elements among the protest crowds, the two men believed, were too small and manageable to justify calling out the military.
Attorney General William Barr on Sunday denied Trump asked for 10,000 troops. When asked on Saturday, the White House would neither confirm nor deny the figure. On Sunday, the White House director of strategic communications, Alyssa Farah, said in a tweet that Trump directed a surge of Guardsmen, not active-duty troops.
A senior White House official recalled Trump urging Esper and Milley to get as many troops as needed to secure the city. The president stressed that Sunday night’s unrest, in which St. John’s Church sustained fire damage and some businesses were vandalized, had shown that security was inadequate.
With the president’s demands in mind, and hoping they could stall his move to use federal troops, Esper and Milley moved swiftly to try to get governors to send as many National Guard troops from their states as possible to supplement the roughly 1,300 District of Columbia National Guard members and a hodgepodge of Park Police, Secret Service and other federal law enforcement officers dealing with protesters.
Because of the District of Columbia’s special status and its dizzying mix of jurisdictions, the FBI field office had been selected to serve as a command post to coordinate the movements and functions of various security forces. Attorney General William Barr was in charge. That’s why Esper was headed there from the Pentagon on Monday afternoon when he got the call to go see Trump again.
Milley had gone to the command center, also. And figuring he had seen the last of the White House for the day, he made a decision he later regretted — changing from his dress uniform, which is standard for a White House visit, to his battle fatigues, everyday wear at the Pentagon and when mixing with troops. Milley figured he would have a long night, including time with troops on the street.
Another surprise was in store for Esper and Milley when they reached the White House. After meetings, Trump went to the Rose Garden, where he noted Americans’ revulsion at Floyd’s death and declared himself the “president of law and order.”
“In recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, antifa and others,” he said. “A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents.”
That failure, in Trump’s view, made it urgent to get more security on the streets, even if it meant using active-duty forces, about 1,300 of which had been moved to military bases just outside of Washington, just in case.
Esper and Milley, joined by Barr, opposed the use of federal troops at that point. To Esper, a failure to get more Guard troops called up would mean there would be active-duty troops all over the country confronting protesters, a scene he and Milley saw as unwise and untenable.
After Trump finished his remarks in the Rose Garden he gathered aides and officials, including Esper and Milley, for a walk across Lafayette Park to St. John’s Church. The president held up a Bible to pose for photographers.
Critics would slam both Esper and Milley for their presence at the photo op — especially with Milley in battle fatigues. The scene fed a perception that Milley was giving tangible meaning to Trump’s threat to use the military on city streets, and that Esper was allowing himself to be used to advance a political agenda.

White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea.,https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/23/how-anti-white-rhetoric-is-fueling-white-nationalism/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,54.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea.
I opened Twitter recently and saw 20+ notifications. Most of the time that means the new generation of white nationalist Twitter trolls are filling my feed with racist and anti-Semitic cartoons. It was the trolls, but this was different. They were celebrating my use of the word “anti-white” in a tweet. They saw it as a victory that a “mainstream conservative” was using this term that for so long has been their calling card.
They had a point. Until recently I would have been unlikely to use the term. Not because I didn’t believe some people harbored animosity towards whites, but because that was a fringe attitude removed from power, which represented little real threat. That is no longer the case. Progressive rhetoric on race has turned an ugly corner and the existence of “anti-white” attitudes can no longer be ignored.
In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Loosely backed up by historical inequities and disparities in mass shootings, this position has begun to take a serious foothold.
Don’t Ask White People to Be More Tribal
Strikingly, this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.
Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race.
White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. The last thing our society needs is for white people to feel more tribal. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.
A big part of the reason white Americans have been willing to go along with policies that are prejudicial on their face, such as affirmative action, is that they do not view themselves as a tribe. Given the inequality of resources favoring whites in our society, it is a good thing that white people view themselves as the ones without an accent. Should that change, white privilege (whatever one views that to be) will not be eviscerated—it will be entrenched.
The Tipping Point of Whiteness
All of this comes at a time when the last immigrants from the great wave of white immigration from 1850-1920 have died off. In the past, most whites identified with their European ethnicity: Irish, Italian, German, etc. As white people gravitate away from such identities, many see themselves as a neutral, “non racial” population. The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as “white,” but it is far preferable to the alternative: an American white population that views itself as a special-interest group.
The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as ‘white,’ but it is far preferable to the alternative.
The recurring, tired refrain that we should have a white history month if there is a black history month, or white student unions on campuses, is unintentionally being given new life by the Left. Celebrations or organizations of whiteness do not exist because we don’t need them. White people do not face the same kinds of systemic discrimination that people of color do. But progressives are doing a very good job of convincing white people that they do.
When parents of Virginia high school students complained about a white privilege video being shown to their kids, they rightfully noted that their kids were being singled out based on their race. The video featured a foot race in which people of color were burdened by impediments while the white people ran free. It was absolutely fair for them to interpret this as a message to their kids saying, “Your accomplishments are easier and less valuable than those of your peers of color.”
Many parents object to this method of teaching about race relations. While some white people, especially those in the academy and the arts, find the acceptance of privilege and its associated guilt liberating, many do not. Privilege theory is also not being offered as one of many ways to confront and consider racism; it is being offered as the central way. This was brilliantly explored in 2010 by the Midwestern Critical Whiteness Collective’s (MCWC’s) article in Harvard Education Review, “McIntosh as Synecdoche: How Teacher Education Focus on White Privilege Undermines Anti Racism.”
Privilege Theory Is the Wrong Track
The McIntosh in question is Peggy McIntosh, whose 1988 essay “Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack” formed the foundation of privilege theory. The essay is mostly a list of ways in which white people receive better treatment in society. The MCWC describes McIntosh’s theory as a synecdoche because it has come to define the totality of education’s anti-racism efforts. It is meant to be the magic pill that clarifies things and sets us on the right course once consumed.
Many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.
They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. One case study involved an education student named John, from a small, non-diverse town. In his final essay for the class John explained his reaction to McIntosh: “I got the feeling from it that it was more about trying to make white males feel guilty for things they most likely had no control over. Being a white male I got a little worked up about the whole list since I don’t feel like I have anything to apologize for.”
John rolled his eyes at privilege theory. However, his teacher reported that other ways of exploring racism and multiculturalism such as films on race relations and historical texts broadened John’s empathy towards non-white people. John was able to reject confession while still becoming a better anti-racist educator. This made John’s teacher wonder whether confessional white privilege is the universally beneficial educational tool it is made out to be. The collective found that it is not.
In its blunt conclusion, the collective writes: “McIntosh’s conception of white privilege has been at the center of anti-racist thought and action in teacher education. We argue, however, that McIntosh’s ideas simplify white racial identity in dangerous ways. We also demonstrate that white privilege pedagogy demands confession, but that confession is a dead end. Finally, we propose that white supremacy needs to replace white privilege as the central concern of our anti-racist efforts.”
Abetting White Supremacy
When privilege theory took root in the 1990s, society roundly condemned the outward expression of racist attitudes. This is why the focus shifted to the ways in which white people were racist without even knowing it. Importantly, all white people were guilty of this form of racism. The act of confessing privilege became the means through which white people discovered this hidden racism.
The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
But, as the past year has shown us, good old-fashioned white supremacy was not gone; it was simply driven underground. Not only was white supremacy still extant, it was going more or less unaddressed. The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
One can teach against white supremacy by encouraging students to treat everyone as equal, or at least as individuals not defined in important ways by their race. Privilege theory does not allow for this approach. It demands that differences be front and center and that we always consider a person’s race in considering him. This focus on “valuing differences” over “the colorblind model” unlocked the door to the white supremacist revival that today’s anti-white rhetoric has kicked open.
White Grievance On the Rise
It surprises many people that an increasing number of white Americans over the past decade believe whites face more discrimination than blacks. Obviously this feeling is inconsistent with economic data. Many have argued that a white fear of losing the dominant economic place in society is behind this belief. But what if the discrimination that white people are feeling and expressing is not primarily economic in nature?
He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way.
This brings us back to John. What got him “worked up” about privilege theory was not that he’d have to compete for jobs with minorities. He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way. Moreover, many resent the pedagogical transformations that their history and culture are undergoing. White historical figures once held in too high esteem have swung the other way into utter disrepute. Also, the histories of no other peoples are being held to these lofty standards.
Mohandas Gandhi’s racism, the Black Panthers’ vicious murders, and Santa Anna’s barbarism are understood within the context of their positive contributions. Increasingly, white Americans perceive that Columbus, Jefferson, Jackson, and many other core white historical figures are consistently brought down a peg in order to decentralize whiteness in history. This assault on their history has a deeper impact than many on the Left are aware of, or willing to admit.
Rise of the White Race Baiters
The combination of the confessional and universal aspects of white privilege and the reconstruction of white history has opened the door for white racial grievance-mongers. From 2014 to 2015, the number of active Klu Klux Klan chapters in the United States grew from 72 to 190, a massive increase for a group so closely associated with hatred. Along with these organized efforts, social media has given a dangerous new platform to white supremacists.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers, specifically on college campuses. Conservative media seize upon disputes over the cultural appropriation of taco night or banning hoopskirts as evidence that minority racial grievance has gotten unhinged.
In emerging white nationalist journals such as Radix, this constant drumbeat of attack against white insensitivity is viewed gravely. What results is a belief among a growing number of whites in the concepts of “white genocide” and “racial realism.”
Both “white genocide” and “racial realism” harken back to the worst elements of American racial history. The former reacts in horror to the races mixing sexually for fear of resulting offspring being impure. The latter pretends to take a cold, scientific look at demography to prove the superiority of the white race. Ideas of this ilk, until recently thought to be confined to a fringe dustbin, have taken on new life in our hyper-racialized society.
Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. They are very aware of the dichotomy between non-white culture, which must be valued at all times (even in the midst of terror attacks), and white culture, which must be criticized and devalued. They don’t like it.
Same Tactics, Different Sides
The result of these societal double standards is for many a desire to lash out against it. For every white college student who dutifully accepts his privilege, many more resent the idea and wish to fight it. The sharpest arrow in their quiver is to be offensive.
In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
This desire to be offensive has given rise to the “alt right.” Supporters of this loosely assembled white nationalist movement understand a playful aspect to its use of slurs. But just as the Left shifted from using anti-white rhetoric as an ironic device to an actual indictment of white culture, so has the alt right come to believe much of its troubling rhetoric.
Do the alt right Twitter trolls really want Jews turned into lampshades, or believe blacks are apes? Many of their supporters say no, that such rhetoric is simply meant to shock the system. They feel oppressed by political correctness and they challenge it, in over-the-top, offensive ways.
If this seems familiar, it should. It is exactly the same approach taken by social justice warriors and purveyors of anti-white rhetoric. The shocking “White Men Are Bad” hot takes serve the same purpose. They are also meant to shock the system. Just as the alt right is willing to denigrate minorities to make plain what they view as racist speech codes, the Left is willing to denigrate straight, white men to make plain what they view as widespread systemic racism.
For both groups the central theme is identity. That theme quickly calcifies into attitudes too brittle to hold up serious discourse. In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
Let’s Find Another Way Forward
W.E.B. Du Bois was born just three years after the end of slavery, but was bullish on the prospects of equality, he writes in “The Souls of Black Folks.”
Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic…
Modern progressives don’t talk about the “greater ideals of the American Republic.” Rather, those ideals have become suspect, empty words used to justify slavery and genocide. But for Du Bois, who was closer to slavery than any of us will ever be, this was not the case. The facile notion that some inherent evil of whiteness must be expunged is anathema to his entire vision of equality and reconciliation.
Put simply, our anti-racism efforts must be refocused away from guilt and confession and towards equality and eradicating irrational judgments based on race. Some on the Left will object, saying that racism is so systemic in society it must be purged before anyone can pretend to treat of others without taking race into account. Some on the Right will object, saying that everything from IQ tests to crime statistics prove something meaningful about the capabilities of individuals based on their race.
Both of these perspectives must be rejected. In their place, we must return to the goal of treating people as individuals, not as representatives of their race.","['pushed', 'remarkably', 'bad']"

“My name is Alyssa Milano, and in 2019 I do not have equal rights in the Constitution,” the activist said, according to The Hill.
“That’s right, because I have a vagina I do not have equality and justice.”
Milano was joined by fellow celebrity activist Patricia Arquette as well as Democratic congresswomen Carolyn Maloney and Jackie Speier. The rally took place in support of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).
The 46-year-old previously rallied for the ERA in June 2018, saying, “It’s hard to empower women when they are not recognized as part of our constitution. Now is the time for that to change and for the ERA to become part of the law for our nation.”
More recently, the Sundays at Tiffany’s star sparked controversy for comparing the “Make America Great Again” hat to a Ku Klux Klan hood.
“The red MAGA hat is the new white hood,” she said in a social media post. “Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself.”
Following backlash to her comment, Milano penned an essay for The Wrap where she doubled down and defended her comments.
“Still, you know what? I am sorry. I’m sorry for the decades and decades of oppression and abuses people of color have faced in this country,” the Charmed actress said.
“I’m sorry that as part of a privileged white majority we did not stop this Administration from happening. I’m sorry to those who have suffered at the hands of the Red Hats and the policies their leadership implements. See, I’m not apologizing to the Red Hats. I’m apologizing for them.”",[]

A piece published by the New York Times this week reflects on the tragic white nationalist rally that took place in Charlottesville last year. The piece primarily focuses on the failure of white nationalists to stage a similar event this year. Just a handful of attendees showed up at a planned follow-up event that took place over the weekend in Washington D.C.
While the piece fairly analyzes the fracturing of the white nationalist movement, it makes the bizarre claim that ideas that are widely popular amongst mainstream conservatives, such as ending affirmative action, are actually white nationalist in origin.
“But some experts on white nationalism say the movement’s political agenda remains disconcertingly widespread,” the piece reads. “And some policy issues the far right has promoted, including immigration restrictions, ending affirmative action and instituting trade protections, have been embraced by mainstream right-wing politicians and pundits.”
To the thinking person, the claim doesn’t make sense. How could this be a new phenomenon adopted from the small white nationalist movement when mainstream conservatives have been fighting to end affirmative action for decades?
Conservative author and economist Thomas Sowell has been arguing against affirmative action for decades. Economist Milton Friedman argued against it in the 1980s. President George W. Bush argued against it in the early 2000s.
Users on Twitter quickly pointed out the absurdity of this claim.

Breitbart News has extensively written about affirmative action. Most recently, coverage has focused on a pending lawsuit against Harvard University filed by an activist group which claims that the Ivy League school’s admission’s practices are biased against Asian applicants.
Thoughtful critics of affirmative action have pointed out that race-based admissions policies are vulnerable to perpetuating specific injustices. For example, the children of a wealthy black entrepreneur may be favored over the white children of absent or abusive parents. A truly holistic admissions approach might allow admissions officers to take race into the equation only when it is demonstrated that race-based discrimination posed a significant barrier to the applicant’s life, if at all.",['bizarre']

While Democrats were diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal, the coronavirus pandemic was beginning in China and arriving in the United States.
The timeline of the two developments — impeachment and coronavirus — is shocking, and reveals the true cost of hyper-partisanship.

For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks.
To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States.
In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China.
For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival.
When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them.
Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner.
But we know why.

This rejection of male-and-female society — including singles, parents, and children — is now the norm in the new Democratic Party, which has embraced the transgender ideology.
That ideology says each persons’ preferences are — and should be — unconnected from their bodies. It says that men and women are interchangeable, and can switch their sex by switching their own sense of “gender identity” so that men who say they are women really do become biological women, complete with female penises.
Also, progressives want the government to clear away the “social construction” — laws and civic norms — which supposedly prevent small women from wrestling large men to the ground, and which deter large men in tutus from trying to Jette far above tall female dancers.
For Democrats, this wave or new regulation, censorship, and civic pressure will free the less-than-one-percent of people who say they are transgender from the oppressive, outdated rules of male-dominated supremacy. People will discard the oppressive “gender binary” of male or female sexes and will embrace the freedom of new “genders” — transgender, bi-gender, non-conforming, etc, etc, etc., progressives say.

In contrast, conservatives say that men and women are legally equal, but their bodies give them different and complementary skills, abilities, and preferences. For example, conservatives point out that men tend to be stronger and will aggressively compete against other men to support their wives and children, while women have the remarkable ability to grow babies and moderate male aggression. Teenage boys and girls also compete and cooperate among themselves in their very different ways, while also finding much time to cooperate across the sexual divide.
Conservatives also point out that transgenderism requires intense government regulation of society to prevent women from ejecting men from their showers and bathrooms, to stop girls complaining when teenage boys run away with the sports titles, and to block female students when scholarships for women go to men.
Rep. Jayapal (and nearly all Dems.) feels Congress must tightly regulate all 330M Americans to ensure ""freedom"" for the less-than-1% of people who wish to switch their sex. But the imp. news is that GOP Leaders have begun opposing the transgender ideology. https://t.co/o80TXo9xzR — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) April 4, 2019
Democrats are fast discarding this ancient understanding of the two sexes.
On March 28, for example, nearly all House Democrats — including Ocasio-Cortez — backed a resolution calling on the Pentagon to recruit “transgender” people who openly insist they are members of the opposite sex.
Whereas President Trump’s ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces would affect all transgender members of the Armed Forces and force them to serve under a policy that stigmatizes and devalues their contributions to our Nation’s defense: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That at the House of Representatives— (1) strongly opposes President Trump’s discriminatory ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces; (2) rejects the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based; and (3) strongly urges the Department of Defense to not reinstate President Trump’s ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces and to maintain an inclusive policy allowing qualified transgender Americans to enlist and serve in the Armed Forces.
Only one Republican denounced the contents of the resolution, Missouri Rep. Vickey Hartzler.
In contrast, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and other Democrats lashed at the GOP. The Pentagon’s decision to define soldiers’ sex by their biology “is an act of cruelty … [and] bigoted,” said Pelosi. It “violates every value of American democracy … [it]would undermine our military readiness … [it is] prejudice, not patriotism … We will never allow hate and prejudice to dictate our national security,” Pelosi said.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama told National Public Radio that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are members of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by his feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, as well as progressives, plus feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women’s rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In February, for example, an Ohio judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she could begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that would allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K–12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in child-rearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.","['normal', 'transgender']"

Are they right?
Earlier this week in the Washington Post, George Will declared that the current riots, COVID, and the collective economic fallout are the death knell of the Trump presidency. Will admits Trump is not the genesis of any of the aforementioned crises but blames him for making them worse. Will believes this can, and should, lead to Trump’s downfall.
Until a few months ago, the booming economy made Trump an all-but-unbeatable incumbent. But with the ongoing pandemic and the unrest of recent days, the nation may be swayed by low morale, economic devastation, and loss of confidence in the commander in chief.
Then again, the media continues its deceptive coverage of the riots and accuses all white people of racism—as though Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd’s murders are not repulsive to all Americans. These are the same failed leftist tactics that helped get Trump elected in 2016. If they keep it up, Trump’s defeat may become wishful thinking on the part of those who have never understood Trump’s people or his appeal.
The Left Still Doesn’t Get Trump or the American People
Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them?
Admittedly, Donald Trump is not who I would have chosen for our nation’s highest office. But the fact remains our fellow Americans elected him. He reflects our current political experience. We cannot dismiss Trump and what he stands for without also dismissing the views of the millions of men and women who choose him to be president. Who in their right mind watches these riots and begs for a Biden presidency?
Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Even if Trump loses in November, millions will still want the kind of policies and leadership that Donald Trump gave them. To ignore them is to invite further division and civil unrest.
No One Makes Americans Feel More Understood than Trump
Will’s rant calls to mind a trip I took to NYC with a friend a few months ago. On our drive home, the car stalled. We ended up taking an hour and a half ride in a tow truck to drag the car from Staten Island to Trenton, NJ.
As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. I can only imagine what he thinks of these protests rage through Manhattan and into his neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Here’s why the Never Trumpers can’t succeed: there’s nothing George Will, Joe Biden, or anyone else can say to this tow truck driver to make him feel more understood, validated, and empowered than Donald Trump does. Frankly, they don’t want this man’s support—but Donald Trump does.
After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government.
Can Anything Stop Donald Trump?
There’s another reality the Never Trumpers and the left can’t see: if you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he’s delivered on almost every promise he’s made to you. No, there is no border wall that Mexico has paid for. Still, this is largely the fault of Congress and the judiciary. On issues like deregulation, economic growth, and the federal courts, Trump has exceeded the expectations of his voters.
Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. So long as the left keeps violating Americans’ sense of justice, voters will stick with the guy they trust to restore it.
They’re Not After Trump, They’re After You
Trump himself put it best in a tweet posted last year.
“In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way.”
This is what causes the loyalty that Trump supporters have for their Commander-in-Chief. They recognize that the left’s attacks on Trump are actually attacks on them. Just like the left has attacked Trump for his SCOTUS picks, or pro-life stance, now they’re attacking him for “stoking racial tensions” and accuse him of using “aggressive tactics” to restore law and order.
Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.
After this national tragedy quiets down, there will be no shortage of voices telling the American people that they should be ashamed of themselves. I assure you, Joe Biden will be chief among them. Donald Trump will lose no support if he can keep doing what he’s always done for his loyal followers: make them feel proud to be American.","['screeds', 'invertebrates', 'abjectness', 'institutional', 'vandalism']"

Owens, who said in her opening remarks that she is a Democrat who supports President Donald Trump, said Democrat policies have harmed blacks.
“The biggest scandal in American politics is that Democrats have been conning minorities into believing we are perpetual victims all but ensuring our failure,” Owens said.
Owens also said the hearing was more about the 2020 election than white nationalism, which she pointed out was much worse in the United States than during the lifetime of her grandfather, who was with her at the hearing.
“He grew up in an America where words like racism and white nationalism held real meaning under the Democrats Jim Crow laws,” Owens said.
“The hearing today is not about white nationalism or hate crimes,” Owens said. “It’s about fear mongering, power and control.”
“It’s a preview of the Democrats’ 2020 strategy,” Owens said.
“Reparations and white nationalism,” Owens said. “That is the Democrats’ preview.”
Later in her remarks, Owens said she has suffered continuous mocking and hatred from Democrats because she is a conservative, including many calling her the N-word and “Uncle Tom.”
She said she came to her conservatism by studying history without the filter Democrats have put on racism in the United States, including the Party’s opposition to ending slavery and its involvement in the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacy.
The committee, led now by the Democrat majority, wrote about the hearing on its website:
“This hearing will examine hate crimes, the impact white nationalist groups have on American communities and the spread of white identity ideology,” the committee’s website states. “The hearing will also foster ideas about what social media companies can do to stem white nationalist propaganda and hate speech online.” “Communities of color and religious minorities have long been subject to discrimination and have been targeted by groups who affiliate with ideologies of hate,” the website states. “White identity groups have a long history of oppressing racial and religious minorities and promote individual expressions of violence with the aim of preserving white racial and political hegemony.”

"In the video, while answering a question of whether conservatives have legitimate fears of Islamic terrorism and therefore justification for measures to stop it, she appears to say that white men are in fact a greater threat.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/29/omars-comments-on-white-men-arent-racist-but-they-are-dangerous/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,55.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"What started as an ironic rhetorical tool has become a real belief among many that white men are inherently more dangerous than any other group.
Last week, controversy erupted over an edited clip from a 2016 Al Jazeera interview with U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) when she was a state assemblywoman. In the video, while answering a question of whether conservatives have legitimate fears of Islamic terrorism and therefore justification for measures to stop it, she appears to say that white men are in fact a greater threat.
Here is her full answer: “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country, and so if fear was the driving force of policies to keep America safe, Americans safe inside of this country, we should be profiling, monitoring, and creating policies to fight the radicalization of white men.”
Over at Reason, Robby Soave argues that this context shows that Omar is not saying anything racist, but instead that conservatives are being hypocritical when analyzing the threats from different groups. I agree with Soave that the remarks are not racist, but I think he’s being a bit too generous in his full-throated exoneration of the statement. The comments are not racist, but they are dangerous.
Omar was using an ironic rhetorical tool to make her point. In 2016 and the years leading up to it, this was an extremely common rhetorical device among progressives on social media. In 2016 I described it, and how it transforms into actual beliefs:
One of the tricky things about irony as a rhetorical device is that it only works if there is some element of truth in the ironic statement. Although Soave might be correct that Omar is talking more about conservatives’ hypocrisy than the violent tendencies of white men as a group, she is pretty clearly doing both.
As Soave also goes on to point out, it is not at all clear that the facts back up her claims about the dangers of white men. Either way, this is a dangerous way to talk about problems of crime and violence. Her claim that white men are more violent than Muslims legitimizes the idea that there are implicit tendencies in racial groups as a whole towards crime and violence.
Just as claiming that higher murder rates by percentage committed by black men suggests some implicit truth about black men, Omar’s argument suggests that something is going on with white men, writ large, that should be addressed. In fact, race is clearly not a determinative factor in violence. There are myriad other factors, such as class, education level, having two parents, neighborhood, etc., that affect whether men of all races commit violent acts.
Racial profiling in law enforcement is a complicated issue. When battling Islamic terror it makes sense to focus on Muslim communities, just as when battling the Italian Mafia or MS-13 it makes sense to focus enforcement energy on Italian and Central American communities. This is especially true when the criminal enterprise itself embraces or enforces ethnicity or religious identity as part of their core mission.
Where people on all sides go off the rails is when they look for traits or inherent qualities in entire groups — be they Italians, Central Americans, Muslims, or white men — to explain why certain, but very few, men in those groups resort to violence. Yes, in targeting white supremacist violence we should focus on white men, but this doesn’t suggest, as Omar does, that there is something inherently more violent about white men.
As the anti-white male articles listed above, and many more in the years since show, the ironic aspect of statements like Omar’s are quickly cleaved from the false assertion that “white men are our greatest threat.” This leaves the entire country more tribalized, not less, and tends to set groups against each other.
Perhaps Omar can be forgiven for not knowing that the ironic device she was employing was metastasizing into real beliefs about some amorphous threat from white men. After all, that phenomenon was relatively new in 2016. But it should be obvious by now that this construct is not a helpful one. It’s much the opposite, actually.
This is a rhetorical device that the left should put to bed. Pretending that the answer to white supremacist violence is to find some fault or underlying cause in the nature of all white men is silly and counterproductive. As we have seen, however, it has become all too common. Violence, intolerance, and hatred know no race or religion, and it is these vices that should be targeted, not some vague notion that entire demographic groups are somehow are inherently more prone to them.","['greater', 'threat']"
Franklin Graham: Democrats Exploit Coronavirus to ‘Defeat Donald Trump in the Election’,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/04/18/franklin-graham-democrats-exploit-coronavirus-defeat-donald-trump-election/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,55.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The Democrat Party is attempting to exploit the coronavirus pandemic to defeat Donald Trump in the November election, evangelical leader Franklin Graham stated on Twitter Friday.
Rev. Graham, the president of Samaritan’s Purse relief fund and son of “America’s pastor” Billy Graham, said that Democrat politicians and the liberal media want to see this lockdown “drag out & further weaken the economy — not to save lives — but to try to use this to defeat Donald Trump in the election.”
Graham has said he finds it encouraging to hear President Trump announce guidelines for reopening America.
“We thank God that it looks like we are past the peak of the #COVID19 infection rate,” Graham wrote in a separate tweet. “We’ve got to get our country up & running before the economy & people’s lives are damaged more.”
Graham added that “we also have to learn how to conduct business & keep production going during a pandemic.”
The evangelical leader came under fire recently for coronavirus relief efforts in New York City carried out by Samaritan’s Purse when the LGBT lobby learned that Graham recruits like-minded Christians as volunteers for his outreach.
LGBT lobby group Accountable for Equality said Graham and Samaritan’s Purse are guilty of “putting New Yorkers’ lives on the line” by recruiting Christians who believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman.
The many Christian volunteers working for Samaritan’s Purse adhere to a statement of Christian principles, including the nature of matrimony as taught by the Christian church.
Chris Fleming, spokesman for Accountable for Equality, stated the group’s behavior is “despicable and flat out blasphemous.”

"Such criminalization would be accomplished via universal background checks, which Harris strongly supports.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/03/kamala-harris-gun-control/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,55.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Democrat presidential hopeful Kamala Harris has a long history of gun control support.
Some of her best known gun control pushes have been for bans on commonly-owned semiautomatic firearms and firearm accessories. But the historical record also finds her taking pains to make concealed carry permits more difficult for law-abiding citizens to obtain.
Taken together, her gun control history presents a would-be presidential candidate at war with Second Amendment in the same way that Hillary Clinton warred against it in 2016.
Ban on Commonly-Owned Semiautomatic Firearms–Whether you look at Harris’ time as California Attorney General or view her through the prism of her current office as Senator, she is opposed to Americans owning some of the most popular semiautomatic firearms on the market. Harris wants a ban that covers AR-15s and AK-47s, as well as numerous semiautomatic shotguns and similar firearms. She presents such a ban as a solution to crime, as if such firearms are a weapon of choice for criminals. However, FBI crime stats show that over four times as many people are stabbed to death annually than are killed with rifles of any kind.
Ban on Bump Stocks–Bump stocks are a firearm accessory that allow semiautomatic firearms to mimic fully automatic ones for a brief time. Such stocks do not convert semiautomatics into automatics. Rather, they help the gun owner use a bump fire technique to shoot faster, but with far less accuracy. Bump stocks have been used criminally one time since they were invented. A ban on the devices would not have prevented a single mass shooting in the U.S. during the 21st century.
Ban 18-20 Year Olds from Buying Long Guns–Harris wants to ban 18-20 year olds from buying long guns. She undertook this push after the February 14, 2018, attack on the Parkland high school, in which a gunman opened fire inside a building while a deputy stood outside and refused to confront him. She has not said whether other constitutional rights of 18-20 year olds, like freedom of speech and of religion, would remain inviolate, but Second Amendment rights would not be enjoyed until the age of 21.
Criminalization of Private Gun Sales–Harris supports the criminalization of private gun sales. Such criminalization would be accomplished via universal background checks, which Harris strongly supports. Americans have enjoyed private gun sales since 1791, the year the Second Amendment was ratified. But under a framework supported by Harris (and House Democrats), it would be a criminal act for a neighbor to sell a gun to a lifelong neighbor without getting government permission via a background check. In the same way, it would be criminal for a friend to sell a gun to a lifelong friend without government permission. Yet while neighbors and friends were being criminalized, Harris’ efforts would do nothing to stop mass shooters because nearly every mass shooter already acquires his guns via background checks.
Fight Against Concealed Carry–During her time as California Attorney General, Harris fought against citizens’ ability to secure a concealed carry permit. She did this most obviously in her fight to preserve the “good cause” requirement in California’s concealed carry law. That requirement means a citizen who has no criminal record, and therefore no reason to be denied a concealed permit, must still convince the state that he or she has “good cause” for carrying a gun for self-defense. On February 13, 2014, Breitbart News reported that a three judge panel from the Ninth Circuit struck down the “good cause” requirement. AG Harris responded by pressuring the court to rehear the case en banc, which the court did. As a result, they overturned the earlier decision and upheld the “good cause” requirement, giving the state final say in who can or cannot get a concealed carry license.

"Of course, the demands of tolerance are not universal. The strong gods are still suppressed and exiled, and the heretic-hunting inquisitors of diversity have become more paranoid and vindictive in triumph.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/08/nationalism-populism-and-saving-ourselves-from-a-dark-future/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,56.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"First Things editor R.R. Reno's book, 'Return of the Strong Gods,' persuasively argues that tolerance and liberalism are now at odds with our community bonds and spiritual convictions.
A specter is haunting the West; our elites see intolerant authoritarianism—along with a plethora of related “-phobias” and “-isms”—everywhere. Populist eruptions and governments from Brexit to Budapest to President Trump are perceived as confirmation of their fears, necessitating increasingly ferocious efforts to defend liberal democratic pluralism and its virtues of openness, tolerance, and inclusivity.
In his new book, Return of the Strong Gods: Nationalism, Populism, and the Future of the West, First Things editor R.R. Reno argues that these fears are mistaken. Rather than protecting us from intolerance and fascism, they are casting out the human loves that sustain cultures and nations against such darkness.
Unlike many writers sympathetic to nationalism and populism, Reno does not direct the blame for our present discontents upon anything so broad as liberalism, modernity, or the Reformation, or anyone so specific as John Locke or William of Ockham.
Rather, he addresses the postwar consensus that blamed the horrors of two World Wars on the “strong gods” that inspire strong loves and strong truth claims. The strong gods are not “golden idols or characters in ancient mythologies…They are whatever has the power to inspire love.” In public life, they are “the objects of our shared loves,” including not only the nation but also its symbols and heroes. And they have been banished as disturbers of the peace.
‘Negative Piety’
Reno presents the philosopher Karl Popper, author of The Open Society and Its Enemies, as a preeminent apostle of this “negative piety.” Popper argued that the Western philosophical tradition inaugurated by Plato was oppressive because it sought to know the truth, and “insofar as truth is known, it must be affirmed, which is to say obeyed. Therein lies the danger…Popper sees any form of transcendence as implicitly totalitarian.” In this analysis, we would be better off without capital-T Truth, for it divides us; it does not bring peace, but a sword.
Therefore, the postwar imperative of “never again!” necessitated disenchantment, openness, and weakness to dissolve the “strong beliefs and powerful loyalties thought to have fueled the conflicts that convulsed the twentieth century.” For instance, the project of the European Union is not just of easier trade and travel, but a deliberate dissolution of national identity and loyalty.
Reno demonstrates the development and eventual dominance of this viewpoint by examining a variety of figures, including George H. W. Bush, Friedrich Hayek, Albert Camus, and Jacques Derrida. Each contributed to the consensus against the strong gods and the trend, only accelerated by the end of the Cold War, toward greater openness: open minds, open economies, open borders, and open marriages.
Reno does overlook John Lennon, whose “Imagine” might be the purest popular expression of this: “Imagine there’s no countries/It isn’t hard to do/Nothing to kill or die for/And no religion, too.” A peaceful “brotherhood of man” will be achieved by weakening and dissolving strong loves and loyalties, when there are no differences worth killing or dying for.
Reservations about this program have withered among Western elites. Reno notes that “the center-left reconciled itself to openness in the economy, the center-right made its peace with ever-greater cultural openness.” The letters LGBT are now brought to you by Wall Street.
Of course, the demands of tolerance are not universal. The strong gods are still suppressed and exiled, and the heretic-hunting inquisitors of diversity have become more paranoid and vindictive in triumph. Pronouns are policed, nonconformist bakers are punished, and from the campus to HR, the bureaucracy of tolerance is a hybrid of the Kafkaesque and the Orwellian. New forms of intolerance and oppression are constantly discovered, and the exquisite sensibilities of the “woke” are able to detect racism, sexism, and so on down to 1 part per million.
Becoming Homeless
Advocates of the postwar consensus point to populist outbreaks as evidence that these repressive measures are necessary to protect the open society from its enemies. But the current populisms in the West are responses to the excess and failures of the postwar consensus, not to its absence. The immediate danger is not that of dark, strong gods, but of a vacuum. Our problems are not those of a closed society, but of one that is too open. We are not suffering from too much solidarity and loyalty, but dissolution.
This is exemplified by a leadership class that is disloyal to those it seeks to lead. On issues of economics and immigration, the rhetoric of openness has gone hand in hand with the ruthless exploitation of cheap labor and the disavowal of economic solidarity with fellow citizens. As Reno notes, “Our center-left leadership class will promise to subsidize working-class consumption, but it won’t reorient the global economy toward their employment.” Welfare, yes; jobs, no—just give the proles some cash so they can distract themselves with cheap consumer goods made in China. The costs of working-class decline are just one more thing for corporations to outsource.
Populist claims that the system is rigged resonate because there is truth in them. Elites are insulated from the worst effects of the cultural and economic dissolution they support. Reno observes that, “For all their talk of an open economy and open society, those in the upper echelons of our society work very hard to protect their children.” Everyone wants a secure future for their children, even if it requires ideological hypocrisy—just look at well-off white liberal parents in New York City and the schools they send their children to.
A broader sense of solidarity no longer informs our culture and economy. We are becoming homeless; a place to live is not the same as a place to belong, and the postwar consensus has deconstructed the sources of belonging. We were told that diversity and inclusion would provide “a home without walls” in which everyone felt welcomed and accepted, but this has not come to pass. Those subjected to these therapies of the open society still seek loyalty and solidarity, which often leads to nurturing grievances and embracing identity politics.
The postwar consensus is in crisis because it is unbalanced; the more dominant it becomes, the more destabilizing its neglect of basic human needs for belonging and solidarity becomes. Reno therefore declares that “We don’t need more diversity and innovation. We need a home. And for that, we will require the return of the strong gods.” The peace and prosperity the postwar consensus promised (and to some degree delivered) is not enough, for humans are not livestock.
The Anti-Human Consensus
We are not fulfilled by a boundless world of autonomous individuality and weak loves. We long to love and be loved. We long for a “we” to belong to and share our love with. In Reno’s words:
We desire to live shoulder to shoulder with our fellow man in the service of shared loves. So no, we are not safer with never-ending critique, the spontaneous order of the free market, technocratic management of utilities, and the other therapies of weakening. Disenchantment will not make our society more humane. When the open society becomes an enemy of shared loves, when critical intelligence wages total war against our anchoring convictions, our spiritual, cultural, and political consensus becomes anti-human.
Discontent is the inevitable result of a political and cultural consensus that is, “at root, fearful of love.” Men may do terrible things for strong loves and loyalties. The strong gods may demand dreadful sacrifices. But “the project of peace without love cannot go on much longer. Man was not created to be alone…We yearn to join ourselves to others, not only in the bond of matrimony, but in civic and religious bonds as well.” Thus, it is not a question of whether the strong gods will return, but what they will be.
The strong gods are coming back. They cannot be wished or sneered or critiqued away. Denouncing tribalism and complaining about ingratitude (as many advocates of the current consensus do) will not keep populism and other passions at bay. Limiting and restraining the dark potential of the strong gods of politics requires the stronger gods of family and faith.
G.K. Chesterton’s observation regarding the Roman Republic remains relevant, for “only men to whom the family is sacred will ever have a standard or status by which to criticize the state. They alone can appeal to something more holy than the gods of the city; the gods of the hearth.” We may also appeal to a God above the gods of the city. A man’s love for God above him, and for his family around him, provide strength that can defy the demands of the state.
As Reno puts it, “The perverse gods of blood, soil, and identity cannot be overcome with the open society therapies of weakening.” They can only be defeated by strong gods that ennoble and elevate. Therefore, he concludes that our task “is to restore public life in the West by developing a language of love and a vision of the ‘we’ that befits our dignity and appeals to our reason as well as to our hearts.”
Reno ends with this call to action, but he has not provided a definitive treatise. Rather, this slim volume is a self-conscious conscious reframing that surveys subjects from statesmen, theologians, and philosophers to architects, authors, and economists. Readers may quibble with parts of it (I would place much more emphasis on the continuity between liberal ideology and the postwar consensus), but the broad argument is persuasive and timely.
This book provides a disenchantment and deconstruction of the postwar consensus itself, revealing that it is not an eternal verity or the sole legitimate basis for culture and government, but a contingent response to the catastrophes of the last century. As such it was understandable, but mistaken. The goal of preventing fanaticism and authoritarianism was laudable, but the method of draining away particularity and its loyalties was not.
Endless openness is making us lonely, homeless, and anxious amidst our material plenitude, and has enervated the elevating loves that alone can resist the strong, dark gods of this world. The strong gods are returning. We will choose whom we serve by who and what we love.","['heretic-hunting', 'vindictive', 'paranoid', 'inquisitors']"
"He’s a 78-year-old white male millionaire seeking the affections of the wokesters, a gruff socialist with bedraggled hair and terrifying policy proposals.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/24/bernie-sanders-is-crazy-but-the-only-candidate-voters-actually-like/#.XlQSQ7jGNzU.twitter,federalist,gun-control,right,56.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display.
The results are in, and the socialist swept Nevada. That’s right, Bernie Sanders soared to victory Saturday for his third straight win — first Iowa, then New Hampshire, and now the Silver State. Things are looking pretty good for the Vermont senator, the 2020 presidential front-runner who leads second-place candidate and gaffe-machine Joe Biden by more than 12 points in the latest polls.
Notwithstanding the media’s endless campaign to smear Sanders, his support is stronger than ever — and, it appears, so is he. Despite a health scare in October, Sanders soldiers on determined and forceful at his rallies and on the debate stage. Next to the former vice president, Sanders presents like a spring chicken.
But aside from his physical resilience, how is he doing so well? He’s a 78-year-old white male millionaire seeking the affections of the wokesters, a gruff socialist with bedraggled hair and terrifying policy proposals, a 2016 presidential reject, and a divisive populist — which, in case you hadn’t noticed, we already have one of those.
Sanders praises the radical Green New Deal, champions a Medicare for All plan with a $34 trillion price tag, nods to abortion as a means of population control, and defends bread lines and Fidel Castro’s Cuba. How is this fanatical rerun boomer mopping the floor with a Rhode’s scholar veteran, two progressive women, the other half of the beloved Obama administration, and Michael Bloomberg?
Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display. Every time Sanders opens his mouth, I believe he believes everything he’s saying. Unlike Obama-wannabe Buttigieg, Sanders feels real. His authentic brand is a perfect blend of “I wrote the damn bill!” fire and witty one-liners. Passion over pandering. Compassion over calculation. Compared to the other candidates, Sanders is the obvious choice.
Sanders Is So Much Stronger Than Biden
Biden is struggling. With each debate, he appears increasingly frail, lacking the crucial stamina Sanders would bring against President Donald Trump in a general election. Since the beginning, Biden has been grasping at the coattails of America’s first black president and relying on his administration’s laurels related to Obamacare, race relations, gun restrictions, and climate change. He’s flaky, having flip-flopped his stance on China and the Hyde amendment, which bars the use of federal funding for abortion in most circumstances.
Biden’s Hyde reversal was “never a good thing in politics,” said David Axelrod, an Obama senior adviser. “And it raises questions about his own performance and his own steadiness and his campaign’s performance.”
This isn’t to say Sanders’ policy has undergone zero evolution over his long tenure in the public eye. Critics assailed him during the 2016 cycle, saying he flipped on gun control and health care, switching from a state-run model to favoring federal administration. But unlike other 2020 contenders, Sanders says what he means and means what he says, remaining overwhelmingly consistent in his advocacy even if his forecasted outcomes for democratic socialism are irrational.
Biden’s endless lane-changing between moderate and progressive induces unpredictable whiplash. In 2020, voters know Sanders offers a much smoother ride.
Michael Bloomberg Can’t Keep up with Bernie
Speaking of whiplash, let’s talk about Michael Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat. Bloomberg may be outspending every other candidate by vast margins, but his Super Tuesday strategy, resulting in a non-presence in all but the last debate and absence in Iowa and New Hampshire, isn’t a great look.
“In Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states in the presidential nomination process, candidates brave freezing temperatures to get out and shake hands. In those states, voters don’t expect to be won over with ad buys and policy papers, they want to meet the candidates personally and be wooed,” wrote Rich Cromwell in The Federalist this month. “Mike Bloomberg doesn’t have time for that.”
Not the case with Sanders, who called out Bloomberg for his absence. “I didn’t see Mike in Iowa when we were holding town meetings with folks there,” Sanders said. “Didn’t see him in New Hampshire, hey you know what, I didn’t see him here in Nevada. Didn’t see him in South Carolina. But he thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.”
Not to mention, Bloomberg’s first debate showing was abysmal — while Sanders never broke stride, even ripping Bloomberg for his filthy billions.
Sanders Discards Buttigieg and Warren Robotics
At her peak, Elizabeth Warren led Sanders in the polls by 12 full points, and now she trails him by over 16 points. In an intersectionality battle, Warren should come out on top, but she isn’t. And it isn’t as if the two progressive icons are running on vastly different policy platforms.
Unlike Sanders, Warren wreaks of insincerity. If she can’t even be honest about her heritage, how are voters supposed to trust her promises and endless plans? Despite her best efforts to appear nonchalant and relatable — think Instagram beer video — Warren just can’t quite get the authenticity thing down. It’s as if all her rehearsed-to-appear-unrehearsed talking points pass through a cringe machine on the way out of her mouth.

Former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg is another robotics champion. The media has propped up Buttigieg as smooth and articulate, but his once-punchy and polished phrases, such as “future former Republicans” and “God doesn’t belong to a political party,” are tired. The novelty has worn off. Having apparently learned nothing from the failed campaigns of Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro, Buttigieg continues “Hispandering” in a way that feels forced.

But authenticity matters to voters, and they seem to see it in Sanders. One of Sanders’ volunteers, 33-year-old Shawn Nevarro, thinks of Sanders like a grandfather. “He’s kind of stern, a little grumpy at times. But, at the same time, you really know he’s looking out for you,” Nevarro said recently after a Nevada Spanish-language campaign event. “There is a huge distrust among the Latinx community with the Democratic party that they’re not following through on their promises. … Bernie is the exact opposite. He has a real authenticity.”
That authenticity could shore up the nomination for Bernie Sanders. Wonks in Washington, journalists buzzing around D.C. newsrooms, Twitter pundits, and campaign strategists would all do well to realize most people vote with their gut. They care more about who candidates are than what they say. Donald Trump wasn’t the smoothest candidate in 2016. He didn’t do Instagram lives from his kitchen, didn’t break out in Spanish at his rallies. He made forgotten voters believe he cared about them — because he did. And now Sanders is doing the same. So far, it’s paying off.","['bedraggled', 'terrifying', 'wokesters', 'gruff']"
"Of course, regionally, the Democrat base consists nearly exclusively on top income earners and rich executives who live in metropolitan areas and major cities along the coasts.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/16/dems-rep-rich-working-class-gop/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,56.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The Democrat Party now represents the nation’s wealthiest citizens, while working-class Americans have flocked to the Republican Party over the last decade, analysis finds.
In research produced by the Wall Street Journal, Democrats and Republicans have seemingly switched voter bases through the decades, shifting political positions on trade and immigration to benefit those voters.
For instance, in 2008, Democrats pulled most of their votes from congressional districts with some of the least economic output and toward those with the highest economic output. Fast-forward to 2018, and Democrats now largely represent voters who live in districts with the largest economic output with only a sliver of low economic output districts.
On the other hand, Republicans have increasingly become the party of the nation’s working and middle class — those living in districts whose economic output is relatively low or average. In 2018, Republican lawmakers do not represent a single section of the nation’s highest economic output districts. Instead, their voter base is concentrated in the lower tiers of economic output.
Likewise, Democrats represent voters whose median household incomes have jumped more than 15 percent over the last decade. For Republican voters, median household incomes have increased only about three percent, according to the Journal‘s analysis.
The trend continues when voters’ jobs are taken into consideration. For example, Democrats represent the overwhelming majority of professional, high-paying industries that are not threatened by free trade and foreign imports — including workers in the financial, insurance, and tech industries.
Oppositely, Republicans increasingly represent workers in the agriculture industry, the mining industry, and low-skilled manufacturing industry — sectors that have been readily gutted because of global free trade and dumping of foreign imports in the American economy.
The Democrats’ voter base of the wealthiest billionaires in the country or professional white-collar employees who work in fields unthreatened by free trade can explain the party’s shift toward a globalist free trade agenda that seeks multilateral trade negotiations and the elimination of all tariffs.
The vast majority of 2020 Democrats running for president have said they would lift the job-creating tariffs that President Donald Trump has placed on foreign steel and aluminum imports.
Meanwhile, Republican voters — the majority of whose jobs are threatened by free trade, as the research notes — have become the most supportive demographic group of tariffs on foreign imports and an economic nationalist agenda that reduces foreign competition in the labor market and American economy.
Of course, regionally, the Democrat base consists nearly exclusively on top income earners and rich executives who live in metropolitan areas and major cities along the coasts.
In the 2016 election, failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won the vast majority of high-income coastal congressional districts in the West Coast and the Northeast.
Trump, who decisively won the election, took home electoral college votes from the heartland of the U.S., winning states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia, the very communities that had been devastated by the Washington, DC, free trade apparatus of the last three decades.

"The coronavirus lockdowns are America’s most regressive government actions since the draft. Even as liberals have quickly noted the virus’s disparate incidence, they have ignored the inequities of government responses.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/28/drastic-coronavirus-lockdowns-are-the-most-regressive-policies-since-the-draft/,federalist,coronavirus,right,56.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The coronavirus lockdowns are America’s most regressive government actions since the draft. Even as liberals have quickly noted the virus’s disparate incidence, they have ignored the inequities of government responses. Ironically, these responses have been most regressive in states with the most “progressive” governments.
In just four months, coronavirus has gone from takeoff to lockdown in the U.S. America’s first Wuhan virus case appeared on Jan. 21, and the first American died Feb. 12. California went into lockdown March 19, followed by New York the next day, and New Jersey on March 21.
Two months later, America is only now emerging from the lockdowns’ unprecedented social and economic cessation. The most restrictive — and longest-lasting — have occurred in blue states. The New York Times observed, “States in the Northeast and on the West Coast, as well as Democratic-led states in the Midwest, have moved the slowest toward reopening.”
The Wall Street Journal currently lists 21 states with “comprehensive, or some,” restrictions on business and travel. Of these, 17 had Democratic governors. Of the four that did not, three had Democrat-controlled legislatures (Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire). Only one of the “restricted” states, Ohio, had a Republican governor and Republican legislature.
The overall cessation has been harsh on nearly all of America — 38.5 million unemployed amid a precipitous plunge in economic activity — but it has been harshest on those with lowest earnings and least savings. In a word, it has been regressive.
Not since the last military draft has the U.S. had a policy so regressive or of such scope. The draft’s last iteration began in 1955 and lasted until 1973. Indelibly linked to the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War, its regressive nature was clear. In its last years, a lottery attempted to make everyone theoretically equal. Still, the draft’s basic character was inescapable.
“A tax in kind” was conservative economist and Nobel laureate Milton Friedman’s description for the draft: “When he is forced to serve, we are in effect imposing on him a tax in kind.” This “tax” fell heaviest on those of least means. If you went to college, you got a deferment. Of course, you had to be able to afford college. The same financial disparity applied to those going to Canada. The draft’s “regressivity gap” only widened: Those who went to college received training, which increased earning potential; those who served lost higher wages they could have earned working.
A half-century removed, Friedman’s draft observations are amazingly prescient to the coronavirus lockdown experience: “Military service is now synonymous with enforced incarceration.” While lockdowns are hard on everyone, they are a “hard time” for those with least resources.
Those people working in lower-earning occupations are most victimized by lockdowns, as they more likely lack work-at-home options. The same regressive dynamic applies to business-owners. Those with limited capital and limited opportunities to borrow suffer most. And it applies to those forced back onto their savings: The smaller, the more vulnerable.
The same regressive effects reverberate throughout different aspects of the lockdowns. In transportation, those with lower incomes face the risks of public transit, or its absence. For those whose children are trapped in inferior public school, their kids lack the same remote learning opportunities of better public and private schools. In child care, outside day care is lost, or its risk increased. Inevitably, bankruptcies will come, and these too will be concentrated here. Full recoveries may take years, if they ever occur.
Despite these increasing regressive effects, the lockdowns spawning them are in the most self-styled “progressive” states. Aiming for what they insist is the public good, these liberal governments have “shot first and asked questions later,” firing from the hip, regardless of those in their line of fire.
Yet as regressive as the lockdowns clearly were from the outset, the most liberal state governments were not only the first to rush into them, but have been the most reluctant to loosen them despite duration amplifying the harms. Nor have these governments been very willing to tailor lockdowns to counties’ specific threats, in spite of the virus’s extremely localized effects.
The draft’s inequities were clear, and efforts to address them failed because the policy was inherently regressive. So too are lockdowns. Understandably, rushing to wage war on the little-understood coronavirus, overly aggressive responses occurred.
Writing in 1967, Friedman recognized this exceptional aspect to the draft too. However, he also observed the draft was the exception, and voluntary service the norm: “This is the method the United States has traditionally used except in major wars. The past two decades are the only exception. It is time we brought that exception to an end.”
As the coronavirus ripple effect expands, the question of allowing such regressive policies to continue as “exceptional” also grows. These policies are clearly becoming less acceptable. As with the draft, this may become the ultimate determinant for regressive lockdowns too.",['regressive']
The declaration that a man’s penis becomes a female penis once a man declares himself to be transgender is built on the transgender claim that men who say they are women are actually women. ,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/21/transgenderism-a-mans-penis-can-be-a-female-penis/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,56.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A man’s penis becomes a female penis once a man declares himself to be transgender, says Indya Moore, one of the players in a transgender-themed TV show on FX network.
If a woman has a penis, her penis is a biologically female penis. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 17, 2019
The declaration is built on the transgender claim that men who say they are women are actually women. But once the men are women, their bodies are women’s bodies. So men’s penises become female penises.
Moore extended the “female penis” claim by declaring the existence of ‘male vaginas,’ which are presumably carried by women who are living as men.
The “female penis” claim went viral because it spotlights the logic of the transgender ideology, which insists the Department of Justice must blur and forbid any legal or civic recognition of the biological distinctions between the two different and complementary male and female sexes.
This policy must be imposed to ensure that children and adults can easily discard their female or male sex by simply declaring they have an opposite-sex “gender,” or have a “gender identity” which is between male and female, say transgender activists.
A person’s “gender,” say activists, is their personal feeling about being female or male, or something in between. For example, Moore’s feelings are described as “binary,” or neither male nor female.
I am a biological non binary. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 20, 2019
Moore’s feelings-are-more-important-than-biology logic was explained by another transgender writer:
Moore took the often-heard rallying cry “trans women are women” one step further: She argued that if trans women are biological women, by definition, a trans woman’s penis is “a biologically female penis.” That’s a radical point missing in mainstream discussions on trans bodies, as trans women are often made to feel as if they should be ashamed of their genitals if they don’t have a vagina.
“Don’t use science to justify your bigotry,” Moore tweeted at critics of the “female penis” claim. “The world is way too weird for that s**t.”
The transgender effort to suppress any recognition that men and women are different and complementary would not matter except for the movement’s political alliance with wealthy progressives and radical feminists who wish to destroy the political power of the male-and-female family.
For example, editors at the New York Times invited a February 7 op-ed which smeared women who reject the political claim that gender is more important than biology. Author Sophie Lewis described the vast majority of women as “terfs”:
… the most vocal trans-exclusionary voices are, ostensibly, “feminist” ones, and anti-trans lobbying is a mainstream activity. Case in point: Ms. Parker told the podcast “Feminist Current” that she’d changed her thinking on trans women after spending time on Mumsnet, a site where parents exchange tips on toilet training and how to get their children to eat vegetables. If such a place sounds benign, consider the words of British writer Edie Miller: “Mumsnet is to British transphobia,” she wrote “what 4Chan is to American fascism.” The term coined to identify women like Ms. Parker and Dr. Long is TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In Britain, TERFs are a powerful force. If, in the United States, the mainstream media has been alarmingly ready to hear “both sides” on the question of trans people’s right to exist, in Britain, TERFs have effectively succeeded in framing the question of trans rights entirely around their own concerns: that is, how these rights for others could contribute to “female erasure.” Many prominent figures in British journalism and politics have been TERFs; British TV has made a sport of endlessly hosting their lurid rudeness and styling it as courage; British newspapers seemingly never tire of broadsides against the menace of “gender ideology.” (With time, the term TERF has become a catchall for all anti-trans feminists, radical or not.)
Lewis’ radical support for the transgender ideology is logical because she wants to minimize the role of male-and-female families. A review of her book, Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family, says:
Rather than making [birth] surrogacy illegal or allowing it to continue as is, Sophie Lewis argues we should be looking to radically transform it. Surrogates should be put front and center, and their rights to the babies they gestate should be expanded to acknowledge that they are more than mere vessels. In doing so we can break down our assumptions that children necessarily belong to those whose genetics they share. This might sound like a radical proposal but expanding our idea of who children belong to would be a good thing. Taking collective responsibility for children, rather than only caring for the ones we share DNA with, would radically transform notions of kinship. Adopting this expanded concept of surrogacy helps us to see that it always, as the saying goes, takes a village to raise a child.
But Lewis’ ‘Terf’ smear is also aimed at lesbians who wish to maintain a clear distinction between women and men. For example, former tennis star Martina Navratilova is being slammed by political activists for her growing opposition to transgenderism in sports. The Guardian reported February:
The former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has been criticised for “disturbing, upsetting, and deeply transphobic” comments after she argued that allowing transgender women [men] to compete in women’s sporting tournaments was “insane and cheating”. The tennis player and gay rights campaigner first drew criticism from equalities activists and trans athletes when she tweeted in December: “You can’t just proclaim yourself a female and be able to compete against women. There must be some standards, and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.” … “To put the argument at its most basic: a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to [fathering] babies if he so desires. “It’s insane and it’s cheating. I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair.”
The Guardian also saw fit to quote a man who is living as a woman describing Navratilova as beset by “transphobia,” as if the former tennis star is mentally ill.
Democrats argue that It is “cruel and unscientific” to define each person’s legal sex by biology. But if sex is not defined by biology/human nature, it will be redefined by politicians & the transgender lobby – regardless of damage to women, men & children https://t.co/4sjsAj9PrN — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 12, 2018
Navratilova’s criticism of the transgender ideology is increasingly echoed by women who say the ideology will erase society’s understanding of women — and of lesbians — as biologically, sexually, and socially very different from men.
This “biology matters” argument is also being made by Andrew Sullivan, a British-born gay advocate who led the political push to allow single-sex marriages. In a February article titled “The Nature of Sex,” Sullivan argues that a pending Democratic-drafted bill which provides legal recognition and rights to people who try to live as members of the opposite sex:
could put all single-sex institutions, events, or groups in legal jeopardy. It could deny lesbians their own unique safe space, free from any trace of men. The bill, in other words, “undermines the fundamental legal groundwork for recognizing and combating sex-based oppression and sex discrimination against women and girls.”
The transgender push to create legal rights for people living as members of the opposite sex would also threaten the legal rights won by gays and lesbians, Sullivan writes:
If you abandon biology in the matter of sex and gender altogether, you may help trans people live fuller, less conflicted lives; but you also undermine the very meaning of homosexuality. If you follow the current ideology of gender as entirely fluid, you actually subvert and undermine core arguments in defense of gay rights. “A gay man loves and desires other men, and a lesbian desires and loves other women,” explains Sky Gilbert, a drag queen. “This defines the existential state of being gay. If there is no such thing as ‘male’ or ‘female,’ the entire self-definition of gay identity, which we have spent generations seeking to validate and protect from bigots, collapses.” Contemporary transgender ideology is not a complement to gay rights; in some ways it is in active opposition to them.
And the truth is that many lesbians and gay men are quite attached to the concept of sex as a natural, biological, material thing. Yes, we are very well aware that sex can be expressed in many different ways. A drag queen and a rugby player are both biologically men, with different expressions of gender. Indeed, a drag queen can also be a rugby player and express his gender identity in a variety of ways, depending on time and place. But he is still a man. And gay men are defined by our attraction to our own biological sex. We are men and attracted to other men. If the concept of a man is deconstructed, so that someone without a penis is a man, then homosexuality itself is deconstructed. Transgender people pose no threat to us, and the vast majority of gay men and lesbians wholeheartedly support protections for transgender people. But transgenderist ideology — including postmodern conceptions of sex and gender — is indeed a threat to homosexuality, because it is a threat to biological sex as a concept.
A growing percentage of progressives oppose any recognition of the reality that men and women are different. But conservatives and feminists are championing the normal view that women and men are different, Sullivan wrote:Pol
It might be a sign of the end-times, or simply a function of our currently scrambled politics, but [in late January], four feminist activists — three from a self-described radical feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front — appeared on a panel at the Heritage Foundation. Together they argued that sex was fundamentally biological, and not socially constructed, and that there is a difference between women and trans women that needs to be respected. For this, they were given a rousing round of applause by the Trump supporters, religious-right members, natural law theorists, and conservative intellectuals who comprised much of the crowd. If you think I’ve just discovered an extremely potent strain of weed and am hallucinating, check out the video of the event.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say are entitled to women’s’ rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug-companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.",['transgender']

"Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th.

Are they right?
Earlier this week in the Washington Post, George Will declared that the current riots, COVID, and the collective economic fallout are the death knell of the Trump presidency. Will admits Trump is not the genesis of any of the aforementioned crises but blames him for making them worse. Will believes this can, and should, lead to Trump’s downfall.
Until a few months ago, the booming economy made Trump an all-but-unbeatable incumbent. But with the ongoing pandemic and the unrest of recent days, the nation may be swayed by low morale, economic devastation, and loss of confidence in the commander in chief.
Then again, the media continues its deceptive coverage of the riots and accuses all white people of racism—as though Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd’s murders are not repulsive to all Americans. These are the same failed leftist tactics that helped get Trump elected in 2016. If they keep it up, Trump’s defeat may become wishful thinking on the part of those who have never understood Trump’s people or his appeal.
The Left Still Doesn’t Get Trump or the American People
Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them?
Admittedly, Donald Trump is not who I would have chosen for our nation’s highest office. But the fact remains our fellow Americans elected him. He reflects our current political experience. We cannot dismiss Trump and what he stands for without also dismissing the views of the millions of men and women who choose him to be president. Who in their right mind watches these riots and begs for a Biden presidency?
Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Even if Trump loses in November, millions will still want the kind of policies and leadership that Donald Trump gave them. To ignore them is to invite further division and civil unrest.
No One Makes Americans Feel More Understood than Trump
Will’s rant calls to mind a trip I took to NYC with a friend a few months ago. On our drive home, the car stalled. We ended up taking an hour and a half ride in a tow truck to drag the car from Staten Island to Trenton, NJ.
As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. I can only imagine what he thinks of these protests rage through Manhattan and into his neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Here’s why the Never Trumpers can’t succeed: there’s nothing George Will, Joe Biden, or anyone else can say to this tow truck driver to make him feel more understood, validated, and empowered than Donald Trump does. Frankly, they don’t want this man’s support—but Donald Trump does.
After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government.
Can Anything Stop Donald Trump?
There’s another reality the Never Trumpers and the left can’t see: if you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he’s delivered on almost every promise he’s made to you. No, there is no border wall that Mexico has paid for. Still, this is largely the fault of Congress and the judiciary. On issues like deregulation, economic growth, and the federal courts, Trump has exceeded the expectations of his voters.
Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. So long as the left keeps violating Americans’ sense of justice, voters will stick with the guy they trust to restore it.
They’re Not After Trump, They’re After You
Trump himself put it best in a tweet posted last year.
“In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way.”
This is what causes the loyalty that Trump supporters have for their Commander-in-Chief. They recognize that the left’s attacks on Trump are actually attacks on them. Just like the left has attacked Trump for his SCOTUS picks, or pro-life stance, now they’re attacking him for “stoking racial tensions” and accuse him of using “aggressive tactics” to restore law and order.
Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.
After this national tragedy quiets down, there will be no shortage of voices telling the American people that they should be ashamed of themselves. I assure you, Joe Biden will be chief among them. Donald Trump will lose no support if he can keep doing what he’s always done for his loyal followers: make them feel proud to be American.","['reality', 'unraveling', 'Never', 'Trumpers', 'leftists']"
"Remember how incensed people got when Trump floated his (admittedly, impractical) ideological test for immigrants.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/14/how-not-to-defend-western-civilization/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,56.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Being an American isn't about your color or ethnicity. Steve King doesn't get it. Nor do many of his detractors
“To be an American is an ideal,” the political theorist Carl Friedrich wrote in 1935, “while to be a Frenchman is a fact.” Iowa’s Steve King doesn’t seem to grasp this distinction. Nor do many of his detractors, who regularly conflate any defense of Western civilization with “white nationalism” or racism.
Commenting on the Dutch politician Geert Wilders this weekend, King caused a furor, tweeting that, “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” Well, why not? If newcomers embrace the principles and virtues of American life and its traditions, the more babies they have the better. Unless your fears are pinned to skin pigmentation rather than assimilation, what difference does it make?
King went on to defend his tweet with a number of confused and contradictory statements. “It’s the culture, not the blood,” King explained on CNN. “If you could go anywhere in the world and adopt these little babies and put them into households that were already assimilated into America, those babies will grow up as American as any other baby with as much patriotism and as much love of country as any other baby. It’s not about race, it’s never been about race … It’s a clash of cultures, not a race.”
That’s fine. But King, a “champion of Western civilization,” soon waded into disconcerting messaging about taking care of “someone else’s babies” and claiming that “intermarriage” will make America “homogeneous.” When you start talking about human beings in this way, you’re framing the argument in ethnocentric and racial terms — culture as blood — and it undercuts the ideals you’re supposedly defending.
So King deserves the condemnation he’s been getting for making the immigration debate about people rather than their ideas. Yet most coverage of congressman’s statement also seems to take offense at his defense of “Western civilization.” Once it was merely in poor form to claim our system was better. Now, evidently, it’s racist.
Steve King is wrong: Civilization is threatened by racism & xenophobia that divide us & encourage violence. I condemn hate & welcome all — Judy Chu (@RepJudyChu) March 13, 2017
Fact is, the modern Left debates immigration using the very same ethnocentric and racial ideas as King, but for entirely different reasons. While one side adopts it for exclusionary purposes, the other uses it as a cudgel of relativism. These days, there is precious little difference between ideas and identity on the Left. So we are asked to treat Islam as a racial or ethnic designation rather than a philosophical/religious/ideological one. This way we don’t debate ideas, history, or beliefs, but color. And if you fail to accept the debate on these terms, you will be subjected to vacuous accusations of “Islamophobia.”
Yet, the rise of the far-Right seems, in part, to be a reaction to the Left’s abdication of defending liberalism. I mean, does anyone believe the Dutch became inveterate racists overnight? Or is the competitiveness of Wilders’ party in Holland predicated on a long-term struggles that have generated upheaval across Europe? The flow of refugees into these nations has featured many people with ideologies and theologies that are in conflict with the values of their new homes. Not all, but enough.
As Sam Harris noted in a 2006 Los Angeles Times piece:
… the failure of liberalism is evident in Western Europe, where the dogma of multiculturalism has left a secular Europe very slow to address the looming problem of religious extremism among its immigrants. The people who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are actually fascists. To say that this does not bode well for liberalism is an understatement: It does not bode well for the future of civilization.
When newcomers aren’t asked to embrace your ideas and are sheltered from the responsibility of assimilation, they created “parallel societies,” as German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently put it. Today, American liberals find the idea of demanding, or even nudging, newcomers to assimilate to be disagreeable and disrespectful act. Judy Chu, for example, welcomes “all;” every single person who has desire to come here, no matter what they believe or how likely they are to become Americanized.
Remember how incensed people got when Trump floated his (admittedly, impractical) ideological test for immigrants. This wasn’t a test for color, race, or ethnicity, but one that gauged beliefs — which is not new to immigration policy. The problem is that many assumed philosophical tests would have a disproportionate effect on Islamic refugees — a de facto ban. But if Chileans, Japanese, and Indians can pass American literacy tests but Pakistanis, Saudis, and Iraqis can’t, doesn’t it tell us something about Islam rather than the test or the color of the person taking it?
It must be pointed out that Muslims have, for the most part, successfully integrated into American society. Unlike Europe, we are structurally and geographically built to assimilate diverse populations. But if we’re going to allow more people to come here from parts of world infested with illiberalism, it seems rational to be cautious and avoid Europe’s mistakes. Because the idea that mass immigration – and I prefer a lot more of it than most conservatives — doesn’t come with any attendant problems is simply ludicrous.
Moreover, why would anyone be offended by someone saying that “Western civilization” is preferable to the alternative? No one is forced to come here. So why would any newcomer be insulted if his prospective home expected him to adopt Western values? That’s what we do here. To be American is an ideal. Sometimes, of course, this civilization fails in the most violent or brutal or embarrassing ways. But, in the aggregate, human flourishing does better, by any measure, under this tradition than others. We shouldn’t let people on the Right or Left distort what it means.","['incensed', 'impractical']"
House Democrats’ Chinese coronavirus relief package bails out coastal millionaires and billionaires while ensuring big businesses are able to freely hire illegal aliens and visa overstayers over unemployed Americans.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/16/pelosi-coronavirus-plan-bails-out-the-rich-with-tax-breaks-cheap-labor/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,57.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"House Democrats’ Chinese coronavirus relief package bails out coastal millionaires and billionaires while ensuring big businesses are able to freely hire illegal aliens and visa overstayers over unemployed Americans.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) HEROES Act would end the cap on a little-known SALT tax deduction that has been strictly limited by President Trump, offering the top one percent in coastal states like New York, Massachusetts, and California a huge tax break.
The maneuver would give millionaires and billionaires, for 2020 and 2021, a windfall of more than $100,000 for taxpayers with annual incomes over $1 million.
“Completely repealing the cap retroactively for the last two years would cost over $130 billion, with about half the benefit going to households making over $1 million a year,” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) analysts write. They add:
Repealing the SALT cap retroactively for two years will also send out checks as people amend their 2018 and 2019 taxes, but those checks would be almost exclusively sent to high-income households. The average household making over $1 million would receive over $100,000. Households making less than $50,000 would receive almost no benefit from repealing or raising the SALT cap.
Likewise, Pelosi’s HEROES Act would provide business with a neverending flood of cheap, illegal foreign labor that they would be legally allowed to hire over the roughly 36.5 million Americans who are jobless due to the crisis.
The provision would suspend the Department of Labor’s ability to prosecute any employer hiring illegal aliens and visa overstayers. A separate provision would drive up foreign competition against unemployed Americans by allowing illegal aliens taking “essential” U.S. jobs to receive work authorization.
Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota reveals that the country’s current mass immigration system burdens U.S. taxpayers and America’s working and middle class while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth every year to major employers and new arrivals. Similarly, research has revealed how Americans’ wages are crushed by the country’s high immigration levels.

No, 2016 was a revolt against the entire Washington establishment, both on the left and the right. Don’t forget, Trump blew away everyone in the Republican primary too, from accomplished governors to Jeb Bush (R) from Tea Party darlings to washed up Senators. Trump wiped the floor with them.
And the message from this trouncing is clear: the American people are tired of the status quo, of business as usual.
So while these Republicans in D.C. are still lost in the mindset that voters will still support them because ""they're not the other guys,"" that's not entirely true: promises were made, tens of millions of dollars were raised off said promises. Time to man up, Republicans, and fulfill those promises or else people might call you for what you're acting like right now: liars.
However, some, seemingly because they lack the courage to do what they said they were going to do, are retiring. I call them the Binky Brigade. As in whining and crying about how that mean big, bad man in the White House is saying hurtful things about them. Memo to the Binky Brigade: this is politics. It's a full contact sport, a blood sport.
It's the battleground of ideas. And why are you worried about Trump saying ""mean"" things about you on Twitter when you should be damn well concerned about your constituents who are going to either vote for you, or not.
The retirements, both voluntary and forced with Luther Strange Luther Johnson StrangeSessions hits back at Trump days ahead of Alabama Senate runoff The biggest political upsets of the decade State 'certificate of need' laws need to go MORE (R), are the beginnings of the Bannon Doctrine: there will be consequences for inaction, and for every establishment action against the America First agenda and its advocates, there will be an even greater reaction.
Elected Republicans had better prepare for primary challengers from the right, just like the Tea Party candidates in 2010. The same forces that sent conservatives to Congress in waves are ready and waiting to remove the members of Congress that refuse to do what they promised.
As Sen. Flake saw in the polls, throw in with the Democrats against the president at your own risk. And by the way, if some had spent the last ten months passing meaningful legislation instead of hand-wringing on Morning Joe and selling your anti-Trump retirement book, or taking an unwarranted August recess, maybe there would be fewer tweets to complain about.
Unfortunately, too many Republicans in Congress are spending more time preparing to respond to tweets than they are to passing legislation. These 17 minute speeches, like Flake’s on Tuesday, don’t come out of nowhere. Flake has been planning his grandstanding on the Senate floor more than he’s been planning to pass legislation the president can pass to address ObamaCare, tax reform, infrastructure, or the myriad of other problems facing our country.
While Flake’s audience ate up every moment of this speech, who really cares? His approval rating is at 18 percent, as in most of the Phoenix phone book has a higher approval rating than he does. Sadly, Flake was preaching to the liberal choir in the Acela corridor, not his voters out in Arizona. So to other members of Congress, feel free to literally knock yourselves out and play to the D.C. and New York City elites. I mean, they're not voting for you, but I bet they’ll buy your book.
So give me a break, Jeff Flake. Put a cork in it, Bob. Do the work you were elected to do, or get out. Remember, winners make policy and losers go home. I'd love for you to go out as winners, but since some of your loser colors have shown through, maybe it is just best you go home.

“I think our immigration policy should take into account the sharp rise in inequality over the last few decades,” David Leonhardt wrote July 17. He explained:
Leonhardt’s column is a modest step but is notable because nearly all former liberals have remained silent about the huge economic and political consequences of their high-migration/cheap-labor economic strategy. The silence is all the more remarkable because one of the most obvious consequences has been the 2016 election of a New York real-estate entrepreneur to the White House.
But Leonhardt’s admission will likely go nowhere because his proposed fix for the current inequality is to shift the pain of cheap-labor migration from blue-collar Americans to his own influential professional class and their cosseted college-graduate children.
Instead of lowering or ending immigration, he suggests the inequality problem can be addressed by reducing, “or at least hold constant, the level of immigration by people who would compete for lower- and middle-wage jobs while increasing immigration among people who would compete for higher-wage jobs.
His column provides more evidence that elite Americans are so enamored of immigration and diversity that they would throw the college graduate class under the bus rather than give up their visions of ruling over a chaotic and fractured “diverse” society.

Breitbart News has provided the most extensive and detailed coverage in the media of the many links between the federal economic policy of migration and the widening economic gap between investors and employees, between the few coastal states and the heartland states, and between the civic status of elitists and ordinary Americans.
Few establishment reporters can follow the money through the immigration debate, partly because their careers are risked by exposing the elites’ economic, statu, and political gains from mass migration. The major risk for journalists is the likely backlash from their own peers and customers — the progressives in the Democratic base, the business elites, and high-status university leaders who pride themselves on their self-serving support for divide-and-rule diversity.","['elite', 'enamored', 'chaotic', 'fractured', 'diverse', 'under', 'the', 'bus']"

While Democrats were diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal, the coronavirus pandemic was beginning in China and arriving in the United States.
The timeline of the two developments — impeachment and coronavirus — is shocking, and reveals the true cost of hyper-partisanship.

For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks.
To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States.
In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China.
For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival.
When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them.
Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner.
But we know why.

"Cuomo has been championed by the mainstream media for his response to the coronavirus pandemic in New York City, but his state-wide response to nursing homes deserves anything but the glowing praise he’s received.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/22/janice-dean-tragic-loss-exposes-andrew-cuomo-failed-response-coronavirus-nursing-homes/,federalist,coronavirus,right,58.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"On Thursday’s edition of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean shared the story of losing her mother-in-law and father-in-law to COVID-19 in a New York City nursing home.
Dean is a largely apolitical figure on the Fox News channel but believes Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s advisory to send COVID-19 elders back into nursing homes is the reason her in-laws are gone. On March 25, Cuomo issued an advisory for hospitals to discharge elderly patients with COVID-19 back to nursing homes to combat alleged discrimination against those diagnosed with coronavirus.
Dean said she is shocked at how underreported this story is. This an intentional policy that has major consequences for elderly people and their families across not only New York, but other states as well.
“I have not seen the coverage of this. You’ve covered it, Martha [McCallum] covered it, the New York Post has covered it. This should be one of the biggest stories of this pandemic, of 2020. Twenty percent of our lost loved ones are from nursing homes. And, it’s because Governor Cuomo, and several other Governors, by the way, in different states, forced COVID-recovering patients into nursing homes,” Dean said.
Dean explains how her father-in-law was transferred to a new floor in his nursing home, out of the blue, and contracted COVID-19. He passed away three hours after nurses discovered he had the virus.
“A week before [my husband’s] dad died, they called [my husband] to tell him they were moving [his dad] to another floor. And I believe that floor was used for recovering COVID patients. I can’t prove that, we can’t get any confirmation on any of this,” Dean said.
Dean also noted the family did not find out that her father-in-law died of COVID-19 until the death certificate was handed to them. Dean’s husband got a call saying his dad “wasn’t feeling well,” and three hours later his father passed away.
The death of Dean’s mother-in-law exemplifies another flaw in the way New York City counts death by coronavirus. According to Dean, her mother-in-law was rushed to the hospital after exemplifying COVID symptoms and on her death certificate she was declared dead in a hospital, not in a nursing home, where she contracted the virus.
The disease has plagued nursing home and elderly care facilities in a disproportionate manner, killing upwards of 10,500 residents and staff in such facilities nationwide. That’s nearly one-fifth of the U.S. coronavirus death total. Cuomo’s decision to allow nursing homes to continue caring for COVID-19 patients is to blame for a large portion of this atrocity.
Cuomo has been championed by the mainstream media for his response to the coronavirus pandemic in New York City, but his state-wide response to nursing homes deserves anything but the glowing praise he’s received. The Dean family’s tragic loss exposes Cuomo’s shoddy job as governor of New York during the coronavirus pandemic.","['championed', 'glowing', 'praise']"
"Democrats are also using the crisis to push for greater immigration, despite the overwhelming public demand that Americans get hired for any jobs during the crash.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/13/democrats-coronavirus-bill-imports-more-foreign-doctors-nurses/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,59.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The House Democrats’ next coronavirus bill will help centralize the nation’s healthcare system by giving hospital chains more power to import many more doctors from overseas, say critics.
The wider pipeline of migrants would help healthcare companies expand their marketplace reach, but it would also sideline many U.S. healthcare professionals and many Americans who want to become doctors, said Kevin Lynn, the founder of Doctors without Jobs and U.S. Tech Workers.
“What we don’t see in this bill is an investment in our people,” he said. “We’re going to make it easier for foreign healthcare workers to come here and work under the umbrella of fighting ‘COVD-19.'”
That is bad news for many thousands of Americans who have passed medical tests but have been denied a slot in the limited number of gateway residency jobs at hospitals, he said. Congress should help Americans help each other by providing more funds to train Americans to become doctors and nurses, he said.
More training of Americans would also reduce the corporate extraction of doctors and nurses from poor countries, such as India, Nigeria, and Sudan, he said. “If you are a doctor from Sudan, would the value-added of remaining in Sudan be greater than adding one more doctor in the United States?”
The Democrats’ bill is dubbed the HEROES Act, and it:
provides fast-track green cards for immigrant doctors who have coronavirus patients, and creates a new block of 12,000 green cards for foreign doctors plus their families. gives fast-track work permits for foreign medical professionals, including doctors and nurses who work with victims of China’s coronavirus. grants work permits for foreign nurses, doctors, and scientists who are working on coronavirus care and treatments. requires the Department of Homeland Security to accept state medical-licensing rules, so helping companies import more foreign medical professionals via the least-demanding state. allows foreign doctors in the U.S. on H-1B work visas to treat patients via telemedicine. This would help hospital chains to treat Americans with long-distance foreign doctors instead of with face-to-face interactions with American doctors.
The legislation also provides work permits for a huge number of illegal migrants who have jobs in the very broad category of “essential critical infrastructure.” That category includes janitors and food workers in hospitals, as well as stoop labor in agriculture.
The demand for foreign medical workers comes as many thousands of U.S. doctors and nurses have been furloughed amid the collapse in consumer demand following the coronavirus crash. In April, the medical sector lost 1.4 million jobs.
The new unemployment adds to the nation’s huge number of retired and part-time medical professionals.
Advocates & media claim 200K DACA migrants are 'crucial' in coronavirus fight.
Umm. Whatever their indiv merits, DACA are a tiny % of America's healthcare grads, of retired or sidelined HC profesnls, & of jobless Americans.
Americans get the job done. https://t.co/HH6yDYEMHd — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) April 8, 2020
Democrats are also using the crisis to push for greater immigration, despite the overwhelming public demand that Americans get hired for any jobs during the crash.
Many GOP legislators oppose legislation that would expand the award of green cards to migrants. So the bill claims not to create new green cards, but only to “recapture previously unused immigrant visas” that were available in prior years but which were not used.
In the short term, the ‘HEROES’ bill is unlikely to pass, but it shows that the nation’s healthcare industry wants to flood the market with hospital-managed foreign doctors and nurses, said Lynn.
Congress is stingy about funding hospital residencies for medical graduates — so 1,000+ doctors fail to get residencies at hospitals in 2020.
That puts many young doctors on the sidelines during a national epidemic.
But Congress has a fix. https://t.co/acDmO0YcIO — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 22, 2020
This rush of new workers will be used by hospital chains to boost revenues and forced down wages — and to undermine Americans’ preference for dealing with familiar, local doctors, he said.
The hospital chains are already boosting their market share in the nation’s healthcare sector by buying up doctors’ officers, Lynn said. As the hospitals used imported doctors to fill the former offices of local doctors, they can funnel patients towards high-profit hospital services, he said.
The Democrats’ draft bill would allow the hospital chains to import more doctors to expand those vertical networks, he said. “It would preserve the profit margins — it doesn’t lead to better healthcare outcomes,” he said.
However, the healthcare sector is winning support in the Senate for a broader bill that would help healthcare companies gain more power over the supply of new doctors and nurses.
GOP Sen. David Perdue, (R-Ga.) is championing a companion bill that would provide 40,000 extra green cards for healthcare employers to import more foreign-trained doctors and nurse.
The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act is backed by the major industry groups in the healthcare sector, including the American Medical Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Hospital Association, American Immigration Lawyers Association, and FWD.us, an advocacy group for West Coast investors.
The bill is backed by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL), Todd Young (R-IN), Chris Coons (D-DE), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT).
The coronavirus crash has decisively shifted the public's ambivalent priorities on immigration:
Away from politely welcoming migrants, and towards loudly demanding more jobs for American grads & blue-collars.

Despite no video or audio evidence corroborating Warren’s allegation against Sanders — and Sanders’ denials that he made the statement — CNN’s Abby Phillip characterized Warren’s claim as factual.
Partial transcript below (emphasis added):
ABBY PHILLIP: Let’s now turn to an issue that’s come up in the last 48 hours. Sen. Sanders, CNN reported yesterday that — and Sen. Warren confirmed in a statement — that in 2018, you told her that you did not believe a woman could win the election. Why did you say that? BERNIE SANDERS: Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t say it, and I don’t want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump — and maybe some in the media — want. Anybody [who] knows me, knows that it’s incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States. Go to YouTube today. There’s a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the United States. In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Sen. Warren. There was a movement to draft Sen. Warren to run for president. And you know what? I stayed back. Sen. Warren decided not to run and then I did run afterwards. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the United States? … ABBY PHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, I do want to be clear, here. You’re saying that you never told Sen. Warren that women could not win the election? BERNIE SANDERS: That is correct. ABBY PHILLIP: Sen. Warren, what did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election? ELIZABETH WARREN: I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie.
Despite Democrats regularly characterizing America as socially pathologized with anti-woman “sexism” and “misogyny” — where women face greater cultural, economic, political, and social adversities relative to men — Warren framed her sex as a political asset in comparison to her male competitors for the Democrats’ presidential nomination to defeat President Donald Trump in November’s general election.
“The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women, Amy and me,” said Warren.
“So true,” concurred Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who is polling at 3.2 percent support in her bid for the Democrats’ presidential nomination, according the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls.

It is therefore no surprise that Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the term “Democratic socialism.”,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/most-democrats-identify-as-liberals-for-first-time-underscoring-leftward-tilt-of-party?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20foxnews%2Fpolitics%20%28Internal%20-%20Politics%20-%20Text%29,fox-news,middle-class,right,59.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Most Democrats identify as liberals for the first time, according to an analysis released Tuesday -- marking the latest sign of a leftward shift of the Democratic Party as it lurches to the fringes on issues such as Medicare-for-all, amnesty for illegal immigrants and a “Green New Deal.”
According to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.
The study is the latest evidence of a party that is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate -- particularly on health care, economics and immigration.
SOCIALISM RISING: DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION, AS PARTY LURCHES LEFT
On Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to launch “the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation” to guarantee health care for all in the city -- including illegal immigrants.
“While the federal government works to gut health care for millions of Americans, New York City is leading the way by guaranteeing that every New Yorker has access to quality, comprehensive access to care, regardless of immigration status or their ability to pay,” he said in a statement.
De Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting ObamaCare. Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, up from 19, according to Newsom's new agenda.
Those left-wing voices presenting once-fringe ideas are also growing louder in Washington, particularly among the new intake of members in the House who have been bolder in embracing left-wing policy proposals and terms like “Democratic Socialism.”
A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the new members in the House and a rising Democratic star, has pushed universal health care as well as a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive “Green New Deal” that she said would be a “wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.”
A draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and “dramatically” expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.
If that wasn’t ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as “a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation."" Its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers “a living wage job to every person who wants one,” a “just transition” for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care “and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.”
So far a number of House members, as well as top 2020 prospects, have offered their support to the proposal.
It is therefore no surprise that Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the term “Democratic socialism.” Another new House member Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the Senate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called himself a Democratic socialist and ran a vigorous 2016 primary challenge to ultimate nominee Hillary Clinton.
The mood in Congress has extended to voters, in particular young people and Democrats, who polls have shown are warming to socialism over capitalism.
AMERICANS WARMING TO SOCIALISM OVER CAPITALISM, POLLS SHOW
A Gallup poll in August showed that 51 percent of 18-29 year-olds back socialism, compared with 47 percent who back capitalism. Meanwhile, 57 percent of Democrats say they hold a positive view of socialism, compared with just 47 percent who support capitalism.

This is a remarkably bad idea.
I opened Twitter recently and saw 20+ notifications. Most of the time that means the new generation of white nationalist Twitter trolls are filling my feed with racist and anti-Semitic cartoons. It was the trolls, but this was different. They were celebrating my use of the word “anti-white” in a tweet. They saw it as a victory that a “mainstream conservative” was using this term that for so long has been their calling card.
They had a point. Until recently I would have been unlikely to use the term. Not because I didn’t believe some people harbored animosity towards whites, but because that was a fringe attitude removed from power, which represented little real threat. That is no longer the case. Progressive rhetoric on race has turned an ugly corner and the existence of “anti-white” attitudes can no longer be ignored.
In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Loosely backed up by historical inequities and disparities in mass shootings, this position has begun to take a serious foothold.
Don’t Ask White People to Be More Tribal
Strikingly, this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.
Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race.
White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. The last thing our society needs is for white people to feel more tribal. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.
A big part of the reason white Americans have been willing to go along with policies that are prejudicial on their face, such as affirmative action, is that they do not view themselves as a tribe. Given the inequality of resources favoring whites in our society, it is a good thing that white people view themselves as the ones without an accent. Should that change, white privilege (whatever one views that to be) will not be eviscerated—it will be entrenched.
The Tipping Point of Whiteness
All of this comes at a time when the last immigrants from the great wave of white immigration from 1850-1920 have died off. In the past, most whites identified with their European ethnicity: Irish, Italian, German, etc. As white people gravitate away from such identities, many see themselves as a neutral, “non racial” population. The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as “white,” but it is far preferable to the alternative: an American white population that views itself as a special-interest group.
The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as ‘white,’ but it is far preferable to the alternative.
The recurring, tired refrain that we should have a white history month if there is a black history month, or white student unions on campuses, is unintentionally being given new life by the Left. Celebrations or organizations of whiteness do not exist because we don’t need them. White people do not face the same kinds of systemic discrimination that people of color do. But progressives are doing a very good job of convincing white people that they do.
When parents of Virginia high school students complained about a white privilege video being shown to their kids, they rightfully noted that their kids were being singled out based on their race. The video featured a foot race in which people of color were burdened by impediments while the white people ran free. It was absolutely fair for them to interpret this as a message to their kids saying, “Your accomplishments are easier and less valuable than those of your peers of color.”
Many parents object to this method of teaching about race relations. While some white people, especially those in the academy and the arts, find the acceptance of privilege and its associated guilt liberating, many do not. Privilege theory is also not being offered as one of many ways to confront and consider racism; it is being offered as the central way. This was brilliantly explored in 2010 by the Midwestern Critical Whiteness Collective’s (MCWC’s) article in Harvard Education Review, “McIntosh as Synecdoche: How Teacher Education Focus on White Privilege Undermines Anti Racism.”
Privilege Theory Is the Wrong Track
The McIntosh in question is Peggy McIntosh, whose 1988 essay “Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack” formed the foundation of privilege theory. The essay is mostly a list of ways in which white people receive better treatment in society. The MCWC describes McIntosh’s theory as a synecdoche because it has come to define the totality of education’s anti-racism efforts. It is meant to be the magic pill that clarifies things and sets us on the right course once consumed.
Many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.
They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. One case study involved an education student named John, from a small, non-diverse town. In his final essay for the class John explained his reaction to McIntosh: “I got the feeling from it that it was more about trying to make white males feel guilty for things they most likely had no control over. Being a white male I got a little worked up about the whole list since I don’t feel like I have anything to apologize for.”
John rolled his eyes at privilege theory. However, his teacher reported that other ways of exploring racism and multiculturalism such as films on race relations and historical texts broadened John’s empathy towards non-white people. John was able to reject confession while still becoming a better anti-racist educator. This made John’s teacher wonder whether confessional white privilege is the universally beneficial educational tool it is made out to be. The collective found that it is not.
In its blunt conclusion, the collective writes: “McIntosh’s conception of white privilege has been at the center of anti-racist thought and action in teacher education. We argue, however, that McIntosh’s ideas simplify white racial identity in dangerous ways. We also demonstrate that white privilege pedagogy demands confession, but that confession is a dead end. Finally, we propose that white supremacy needs to replace white privilege as the central concern of our anti-racist efforts.”
Abetting White Supremacy
When privilege theory took root in the 1990s, society roundly condemned the outward expression of racist attitudes. This is why the focus shifted to the ways in which white people were racist without even knowing it. Importantly, all white people were guilty of this form of racism. The act of confessing privilege became the means through which white people discovered this hidden racism.
The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
But, as the past year has shown us, good old-fashioned white supremacy was not gone; it was simply driven underground. Not only was white supremacy still extant, it was going more or less unaddressed. The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
One can teach against white supremacy by encouraging students to treat everyone as equal, or at least as individuals not defined in important ways by their race. Privilege theory does not allow for this approach. It demands that differences be front and center and that we always consider a person’s race in considering him. This focus on “valuing differences” over “the colorblind model” unlocked the door to the white supremacist revival that today’s anti-white rhetoric has kicked open.
White Grievance On the Rise
It surprises many people that an increasing number of white Americans over the past decade believe whites face more discrimination than blacks. Obviously this feeling is inconsistent with economic data. Many have argued that a white fear of losing the dominant economic place in society is behind this belief. But what if the discrimination that white people are feeling and expressing is not primarily economic in nature?
He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way.
This brings us back to John. What got him “worked up” about privilege theory was not that he’d have to compete for jobs with minorities. He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way. Moreover, many resent the pedagogical transformations that their history and culture are undergoing. White historical figures once held in too high esteem have swung the other way into utter disrepute. Also, the histories of no other peoples are being held to these lofty standards.
Mohandas Gandhi’s racism, the Black Panthers’ vicious murders, and Santa Anna’s barbarism are understood within the context of their positive contributions. Increasingly, white Americans perceive that Columbus, Jefferson, Jackson, and many other core white historical figures are consistently brought down a peg in order to decentralize whiteness in history. This assault on their history has a deeper impact than many on the Left are aware of, or willing to admit.
Rise of the White Race Baiters
The combination of the confessional and universal aspects of white privilege and the reconstruction of white history has opened the door for white racial grievance-mongers. From 2014 to 2015, the number of active Klu Klux Klan chapters in the United States grew from 72 to 190, a massive increase for a group so closely associated with hatred. Along with these organized efforts, social media has given a dangerous new platform to white supremacists.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers, specifically on college campuses. Conservative media seize upon disputes over the cultural appropriation of taco night or banning hoopskirts as evidence that minority racial grievance has gotten unhinged.
In emerging white nationalist journals such as Radix, this constant drumbeat of attack against white insensitivity is viewed gravely. What results is a belief among a growing number of whites in the concepts of “white genocide” and “racial realism.”
Both “white genocide” and “racial realism” harken back to the worst elements of American racial history. The former reacts in horror to the races mixing sexually for fear of resulting offspring being impure. The latter pretends to take a cold, scientific look at demography to prove the superiority of the white race. Ideas of this ilk, until recently thought to be confined to a fringe dustbin, have taken on new life in our hyper-racialized society.
Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. They are very aware of the dichotomy between non-white culture, which must be valued at all times (even in the midst of terror attacks), and white culture, which must be criticized and devalued. They don’t like it.
Same Tactics, Different Sides
The result of these societal double standards is for many a desire to lash out against it. For every white college student who dutifully accepts his privilege, many more resent the idea and wish to fight it. The sharpest arrow in their quiver is to be offensive.
In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
This desire to be offensive has given rise to the “alt right.” Supporters of this loosely assembled white nationalist movement understand a playful aspect to its use of slurs. But just as the Left shifted from using anti-white rhetoric as an ironic device to an actual indictment of white culture, so has the alt right come to believe much of its troubling rhetoric.
Do the alt right Twitter trolls really want Jews turned into lampshades, or believe blacks are apes? Many of their supporters say no, that such rhetoric is simply meant to shock the system. They feel oppressed by political correctness and they challenge it, in over-the-top, offensive ways.
If this seems familiar, it should. It is exactly the same approach taken by social justice warriors and purveyors of anti-white rhetoric. The shocking “White Men Are Bad” hot takes serve the same purpose. They are also meant to shock the system. Just as the alt right is willing to denigrate minorities to make plain what they view as racist speech codes, the Left is willing to denigrate straight, white men to make plain what they view as widespread systemic racism.
For both groups the central theme is identity. That theme quickly calcifies into attitudes too brittle to hold up serious discourse. In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
Let’s Find Another Way Forward
W.E.B. Du Bois was born just three years after the end of slavery, but was bullish on the prospects of equality, he writes in “The Souls of Black Folks.”
Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic…
Modern progressives don’t talk about the “greater ideals of the American Republic.” Rather, those ideals have become suspect, empty words used to justify slavery and genocide. But for Du Bois, who was closer to slavery than any of us will ever be, this was not the case. The facile notion that some inherent evil of whiteness must be expunged is anathema to his entire vision of equality and reconciliation.
Put simply, our anti-racism efforts must be refocused away from guilt and confession and towards equality and eradicating irrational judgments based on race. Some on the Left will object, saying that racism is so systemic in society it must be purged before anyone can pretend to treat of others without taking race into account. Some on the Right will object, saying that everything from IQ tests to crime statistics prove something meaningful about the capabilities of individuals based on their race.
Both of these perspectives must be rejected. In their place, we must return to the goal of treating people as individuals, not as representatives of their race.","['dangerous', 'immoral']"

Trump kicked off his second day on the subcontinent with an elaborate outdoor welcome ceremony in front of the grand Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential Palace in New Delhi.
Cannons fired as the president's armored car, nicknamed ""The Beast,"" rolled through the palace gates accompanied by a parade of red-uniformed guards on horseback. The ceremony included hundreds of military officials, marching with instruments and swords, as well as an official greeting by India's president and its prime minister, Narendra Modi.

A day earlier in New Delhi, at least seven people, including a police officer, were killed and dozens were injured in clashes between hundreds of supporters and opponents of a new citizenship law in India that provides fast-track naturalization for some foreign-born religious minorities but not Muslims, police said Tuesday.
There were no protests in New Delhi on Tuesday, when Modi hosted Trump at Hyderabad House in the capital for the official portion of the president's visit to India.
“The last two days were amazing in every sense of the word,"" Trump said as he and Modi briefly addressed reporters. Trump said progress was being made on trade, fighter-jet purchases and energy.
Modi said he was thankful Trump visited despite the presidential campaign underway in the United States. Trump has said the short India visit was partly due to presidential politics.
“I know that it’s busy time for you in the United States,” Modi told Trump. ""But despite that, you accepted an invitation to visit India. I welcome you and your delegation.”
The leaders were also expected to announce an arms deal Tuesday as part of Trump's jam-packed day in the Indian capital that will include a joint statement with Modi, meetings with business leaders and embassy officials, a solo news conference and an opulent state dinner before the president heads back to Washington.
But Trump has made clear that little progress is expected on the trade front, despite rising tensions between the countries after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium exports. India responded with higher penalties on U.S. agricultural goods and restrictions on medical devices, prompting the U.S. to strip India of its decades-old trade preferences.
Trump told reporters Monday that he's in “no rush” for a trade agreement with India.
Eyes also will be on whether Trump will criticize Modi over the new citizenship law, which has raised fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Trump typically refrains from publicly rebuking world leaders for human rights abuses during his overseas trips. He spoke at length on Monday about measures his administration had taken to combat the threat of “radical Islamic terrorism.”
TRUMP RECEIVES WARM WELCOME IN INDIA
During Monday's protests, police fired tear gas and used canes as they charged at the protesters in several districts of New Delhi. The rival groups hurled rocks at each other and set some houses, shops, vehicles and a gasoline pump on fire. Police closed access to two metro stations in the area.
Trump's comments came during a mega-rally in the world's largest cricket stadium — part of an elaborate welcome for a president who revels in pomp and pageantry.
Trump joked Tuesday that the crowd had been there more for Modi than for him, saying people cheered every time he mentioned Modi's name.
“So they love you in India and that's a good thing.,” Trump said.
Everywhere he went on Monday, Trump was greeted by thousands of cheering Indian citizens, troops of traditional dancers and roadways lined with posters and billboards celebrating his visit. Trump and first lady Melania Trump also went on a stunning sunset tour of the famed Taj Mahal.

"We used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times, we know it’s just another sinister tool of white supremacy.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/12/new-york-times-needs-get-white-supremacy-fetish/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,60.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait like an article arguing white supremacists have an Asian woman fetish.
We used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times, we know it’s just another sinister tool of white supremacy.
Over the past few years, it seems like every week our media-academia complex discovers a new addition to the list of “things that seem completely innocuous but are actually white supremacist.” In recent months, for example, we’ve learned that math, logic, and even square dancing are “weapon[s] of white supremacy.” (You should feel a pang of guilt for every time you do-si-doed in elementary school.)
Here’s their latest hot take: in a recent essay for the New York Times Sunday Review, journalist Audrea Lim argues that “the white supremacists on the far right have ‘yellow fever’ — an Asian woman fetish.” Her evidence boils down to a few anecdotes about the worst-of-the-worst of white nationalism: perennial idiot Richard Spencer thinks Asian girls are “cute” and “smart,” Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin went to a shopping mall with his Filipina girlfriend, and Asian-American porn star Tila Tequila once did a Nazi salute.
To bolster her argument with historical context, Lim even includes a direct quote from Adolf Hitler expressing his admiration for the civilizations of China and Japan. Pro tip: when you’re quoting Hitler, you’re losing the argument.
How About Providing Some Evidence For Those Claims
Certainly, there is a stock character in American life of the lonely, socially awkward, middle-aged white man who wants a “submissive Asian wife.” A feature-length PBS documentary even follows one of these sad sacks in his quest to find a mail-order bride from China. It’s pathetic and trades in racial stereotypes, but that hardly makes it “white supremacist.” In fact, Lim provides no evidence that this phenomenon is even unique to white men, which begs the question: is it really true that white men have an “Asian fetish”?
Lim doesn’t say, but thankfully, we can find detailed statistical information through a simple Google search. According to research by the dating site OkCupid, American men of all racial backgrounds find Asian women highly attractive. In fact, Asian-American women are the only racial group to score net positive ratings from men of all ethnic groups.
If you think about it, Lim’s argument is bizarre. If someone told me Italians were the most handsome, creative, and intelligent people in the world, I would click my heels, praise their good sense, and go about my day. But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success.
More deeply, however, Lim’s argument is that the very idea that Asians are “civilized, advanced and highly intelligent … [has] roots in white supremacy.” Really? I worked as a journalist in China for more than a year, and it was clear to me that the Chinese think of themselves as civilized, advanced, and highly intelligent. If anything, it’s a self-identity that has been accepted, not invented, by the West.
Furthermore, in America, that positive image is a factual reality. Asian-Americans have higher median income and education levels than any other racial group does. Contra Lim, Asian-Americans are not a “model minority,” they’re model citizens with strong family bonds, high educational attainment, and high economic productivity. There’s nothing wrong with that — in fact, it’s a major accomplishment to celebrate.
This Argument Ends In Banning Interracial Marriage
Unfortunately, while the essay sets up the premise that white supremacy lurks at the heart of the relationships between white men and Asian women, it fails to deliver a conclusion. I’ll fill it in for you. If we take Lim’s argument to its logical end (and reject the idea that logic itself is “white supremacist”), maybe she’s suggesting that white men who marry Asian women are, in the language of the sociological literature, “colonizing their bodies.”
Or maybe white men are simply using their privilege as the progenitors of global beauty standards to extend their patriarchal dominance over a favored minority race. Or, to read into Lim’s ominous invocation of Hitler, maybe it’s all a secret plot to resurrect the Axis alliance between the great European and Asian powers. Of course, the author doesn’t go this far — her essay is ridiculous enough — but there’s no way you can accept her premise without concluding at the very least that interracial marriage between white men and Asian women is somehow wrong.
I take this insinuation personally. I’m a white man married to an Asian-American woman. We have two children together. Like the civil rights leaders in the 1960s, I believe interracial marriage is a sign of social progress. At its best, marriage is about human love, which transcends all considerations of race, class, and identity. One might even consider it to be the fullest expression of the idea of e pluribus unum, which I support by any means necessary — through assimilation, marriage, and the bonds of mutual citizenship.
While there may be awkward moments as we traverse the boundaries of ethnic identity, I believe that interracial marriage makes us stronger as a nation and will slowly help stamp out the real racism that still exists in America. Rather than conflate interracial marriage with the poisonous ideology of white supremacy, we should celebrate it as it’s practiced by millions of Americans: as an expression of love, unity, and tolerance.
Articles Like This Make Everything Worse
Ultimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They’re bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them. They’re a miniscule fraction of the population — numbering in the thousands in a nation of 323 million — and deserve to be snubbed out of public life.
Sadly, articles like “white supremacists have an Asian fetish” are counterproductive, bringing them even greater attention and trivializing the real legacy of white supremacy, the original sin of American history. The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater editorial discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait. In the past year, the Times has published articles about a white supremacist’s wedding registry, whether black and white preschoolers can really be friends, and how “nachos” and “Nazi” share the same etymological origin. The coverage has been so over-the-top, you might even say The New York Times has a “white supremacy fetish.”
Luckily, America is moving forward, with or without the Times. Interracial marriage is a fast-rising trend and leading to broader social tolerance. The percentage of multiracial children born in the United States has increased from 1 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 2013. The social taboos against racial mixing have begun to fade and a majority of multiracial Americans are proud of their blended heritage and more open to other cultures.
On a final note of optimism: mixed-race people are actually seen as the most attractive of all racial types. Thus, if this trend continues, we may soon be able to say objectively that America has the most beautiful people in the world. That’s something worth fighting for.","['white', 'supremacy', 'sinister']"
"Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them.",http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/EReXUAKj_UQ/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,60.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times on Thursday published an op-ed written by Sirajuddin Haqqani, deputy leader of the Taliban and a globally designated terrorist with a $5 million FBI reward on his head.
Haqqani used the opportunity extended by the Times to recite Taliban propaganda and lay out the terrorist organization’s terms for peace in Afghanistan.
The FBI wants Haqqani for “questioning in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen.” He is also wanted for participating in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan and planning the attempted assassination of former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2008.
Haqqani is not only deputy commander of the Taliban but also the operational commander of the Haqqani Network, the infamous criminal gang and internationally designated terrorist organization allied with the Taliban that is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl. Sirajuddin Haqqani’s father Jalaluddin, founder of the network, died after a long illness several years ago.
The New York Times did not see fit to provide any of this background information to readers, identifying Sirajuddin Haqqani as merely “deputy leader of the Taliban.”
In his op-ed, Haqqani portrayed the Taliban as reasonable negotiators appalled by the loss of life in Afghanistan, excusing his group’s atrocities and remorseless attacks on civilians as justified acts of self-defense. He blamed the United States for undermining previous efforts at working out a peace deal.
“We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,” Haqqani wrote.
The terrorist leader claimed that his side stuck with the current round of negotiations despite “the intensified bombing campaign against our villages by the United States and the flip-flopping and ever-moving goal posts of the American side.”
Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them:
We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference. It is important that no one front-loads this process with predetermined outcomes and preconditions. We are committed to working with other parties in a consultative manner of genuine respect to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected and where no Afghan feels excluded. I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity.
This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death.
Haqqani claimed concerns about the Taliban allowing Afghanistan to be used as a staging ground for international terrorist organizations are “politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war” and pledged to “take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil.”
“We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” he wrote.
The bottom line, laid out at the end of Haqqani’s op-ed, is that the United States is clearly interested in ending its nearly two-decade involvement in Afghanistan’s endless bloodshed, and the Taliban wants the U.S. to depart badly enough to make a few immediate practical concessions plus a few long-term rhetorical concessions that everyone will pretend to believe until American troops are gone:
We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation — or even a partnership — in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country — to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.
The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. There is not much left to do except hope the Afghans rise to the occasion and hold the Taliban to some of the promises it is making.
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) argued in August that Sirajuddin Haqqani’s position in both terrorist groups made him the man the Trump administration needed to talk to, in order to hammer out a workable exit plan from Afghanistan.
Among other factors, CFR noted the Haqqani Network is a more potent international terror threat than the Taliban and more interested in “international jihad,” while the Taliban is more focused on regaining control of Afghanistan. Haqqani’s patronage is also vital to the survival of jihadi groups in Pakistan and expanding jihad franchises beyond the Middle East.
CFR quoted the assessment of Gen. John R. Allen, former commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, saying, “Although many Jihadi groups are sending their rank and file to places like Syria, few of these groups have the close relations with al Qaeda, media savvy, military capability, and technical expertise for suicide attacks like the Haqqani network.” For example, not many other jihad groups are media-savvy enough to get op-eds published in the New York Times without any mention of the outstanding FBI warrants for their arrest.","['murderous', 'extremists', 'pretending', 'laughably', 'caves']"

Although little information is available regarding where the former vice president flew via the company, the trips likely took place during the month of May, as that is when Biden’s campaign made the payments. The first payment, coming only a week after Biden entered the presidential race, was a May 2-3 trip costing more than $123,000. Two other payments were made on May 10 and May 31 for a combined total of more than $133,000.
It is unclear if the payments were for more than four trips or what type of aircraft Biden’s campaign chartered. Advanced Aviation, which bills itself as providing “presidential level services,” allows individuals to charter eight different styles of aircraft, including helicopters and airliners with the capacity to transport 200 passengers.
The campaign’s decision to rely on private air travel is surprising considering the criticism Biden leveled at both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential campaign.
“It’s a seven hour ride from Chicago, I apologize—and I don’t have a plane,” Biden said in 2007 upon arriving late at the Brown and Black Presidential Forum in Iowa. The remark was widely seen as a rebuke of both Obama and Clinton, who had traveled to the event by chartered plane.
Even before jumping into the presidential race, Biden had showcased a taste for luxury air travel. In January, The New York Times reported that Biden often demanded private jets ferry him to and from speaking engagements.
For one such speech at the University of Utah, Biden’s public relations teams requested an additional $10,000 —on top of his $100,000 speaking fee — to accommodate the former vice president’s travel requirements.
Biden’s “contract with the University of Utah, obtained through the state’s freedom of information act, was for $100,000, plus $10,000 for the private plane,” the Times reported. “In an October email between university officials, one told the other that an agent for Mr. Biden had described that as a discount.”
The paper, however, noted that was only one demand Biden had for his speech to the school’s student body.
The University “would buy 1,000 copies of his recent memoir from a designated vendor,” the Times reported. “There would be no insertion of the word ‘former’ before ‘vice president’ in social media promotions.”
The revelation of Biden’s private jet travel comes to light as the former vice president is attempting to paint himself as the only Democrat capable of winning back working class voters in 2020.
“I’m called middle-class Joe. It’s not meant as a compliment. It means I’m not sophisticated,” Biden is known to say on the campaign trail. “But I know what made this country what it is, ordinary people doing extraordinary things.”
Despite the claims, Biden’s tax returns for the past two years show he is a multi-millionaire who earned than $15.6 million since leaving the White House.
The money has allowed the former vice president, who was once known as the poorest member of Congress, to upgrade his lifestyle substantially, including the rental of a 11,750 square foot Georgian-style mansion overlooking the Potomac River in McLean, Virginia.","['luxury', 'showcased']"

Rush Limbaugh stood to a room of cheers at Tuesday’s State of the Union address. After Limbaugh’s revelation Monday that he has stage four lung cancer, the president awarded him the highest civilian honor in the U.S., the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Limbaugh, visibly moved and humbled, stood beside his wife as the First Lady presented him the medal on the president’s behalf.
This was not the president’s first gesture of warmth in the wake of Limbaugh’s sad revelation. The president took to Twitter to cheer him on, saying, “Many people do not know what a great guy & fantastic political talent the great Rush Limbaugh is. There is nobody like him. Looking for a speedy recovery for our friend!”

The two men are known to be friendly and frequently golf together at Mar-a-lago. But apart from their friendship, Trump should feel a great bond with Limbaugh. After all, without his three decades of on-air bombast, bluster, and fearless defense of his audience, there likely would not be a President Trump.
Although few could have known it then, Limbaugh seems to have been the voice calling out in the wilderness, preparing America for a Trump presidency. As America came to love Limbaugh, it would soon come to love Trump. Here are four ways Limbaugh paved Trump’s way to the White House.
1. Not Accepting the DC Elite’s Excuses
When Republican lawmakers had every excuse for not defeating or repealing Obamacare after promising to do so for a decade, Limbaugh wasn’t hearing any of it. “In the past, we’ve gotten lip service…but if you listen carefully, you’ll hear them say, ‘Well we actually can’t. Yeah, we want to repeal it, but it would be very tough to do, and besides, we can’t really do it until we get the White House back…’”
Limbaugh called these excuses out for what they were: a smokescreen for thwarting the will of the people. In some cases, that’s even meant Limbaugh not taking excuses from Trump himself. When Trump signed the massive omnibus spending bill in 2018, Limbaugh gave the president flak for it. Both men see that Washington’s “business as usual” has done little for the average American, so both balk at the ways of Washington’s deep state elite.
2. Bringing Big Ideas Home for Average Americans
When Limbaugh first went on the air 32 years ago, it was unheard of that a conservative commentator would fill three hours of air time with few phone calls and almost no guests. Instead, it was just one guy with a microphone, an opinion and guts.
People were transfixed. Limbaugh educated a generation of casually conservative voters about the fundamental principles and concepts behind their beliefs. Especially to Boomers, he took conservative principles out of the Buckley-esque ivory tower and put them where they mattered: in their daily lives.
While no one is praising Trump as a thought leader in the way Limbaugh has been, he’s undeniably made conservative ideas tangible for average Americans. In the chants “Lock her up” or “Build a wall,” he may not be quoting Cato, but he’s making a connection between policy and Americans’ everyday lives.
3. Cutting Through B.S. with Surgical Accuracy
If Limbaugh and Trump shared a mantra, it would be, “Sorry, not sorry.” They call them like they see them and don’t flinch. One of Limbaugh’s signature moves is taking down opposing opinions with both bravado and merciless logic. Sure, he might dress down a liberal caller as a “cheap bastard,” but not without eloquently explaining why his argument on the minimum wage is wrong.
Long before the Trump “Access Hollywood” tape was a gleam in CNN’s eye, the liberal media jumped on Limbaugh in 2012 for calling a female law student a “slut” and “prostitute” for advocating for employer-funded birth control. While Limbaugh did apologize for the personal insults, he stood by the nerve he struck.
Americans heard the left arguing that unlimited birth control, paid for by taxpayers, is a fundamental right. As he does, Rush called B.S., and his fans cheered. Such a masterful takedown would not be seen again until the 2016 election, when Donald Trump called nonsense on Elizabeth Warren’s bogus Native American heritage, dubbing her “Pocahontas.”
4. Reassuring Americans Their Values Are Worth Upholding
Like Trump, sadly Limbaugh’s private life sometimes runs counter to conservative ideals. He’s been married multiple times. He came out publicly about his addiction to prescription painkillers in 2003, struggling for several years after with relapses, drug charges, and stints in rehab. Still, his audience was fiercely loyal.
In both Limbaugh and Trump’s cases, their public has forgiven them sins that would have destroyed many others. In fact, many choir boys rush to their defense. Why? Because they are a powerful voice that defends their audience’s right to believe as they do and not be judged for it.
In a too-perfect example, comedian Al Franken once wrote a book titled “Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot.” It’s true that Franken eventually became a senator, but both Limbaugh and Franken have faced very public accusations of sexism. Today, only one of them still has a successful public career—and it’s not Franken.
Ultimately, Limbaugh and Trump are loved and hated for the same reason: because they’re successful. Limbaugh revolutionized talk radio and spawned a generation of fierce conservatives.
Some people hate Trump and mock everything from his geography gaffes to his appearance. They’ve done the same thing with Rush. All of this mockery and vitriol is just an attempt to thwart their real success in revolutionizing American culture and politics. But just as Limbaugh has succeeded, so will Trump—because they, not their adversaries, understand what makes America tick.","['bombast', 'bluster', 'fearless', 'defense']"
House and Senate Democrats are responding to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States by supporting measures to effectively strip President Trump of his authority to impose travel bans to protect American citizens.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/11/democrat-response-to-coronavirus-end-trumps-travel-bans-on-china-iran/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,60.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"House and Senate Democrats are responding to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States by supporting measures to effectively strip President Trump of his authority to impose travel bans to protect American citizens.
While Trump has implemented travel bans on China and Iran — two of the most coronavirus-affected nations in the world — House Democrats are looking to roll back the president’s authority to enact travel bans from regions of the world.
The “No Ban Act,” introduced by Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA) and co-sponsored by 219 House Democrats, would have prevented Trump from immediately implementing a travel ban on China once the outbreak of the coronavirus spread past its origins of Wuhan.
Instead, the No Ban Act would have allowed travelers from Wuhan to continue to arrive in the U.S. while the president received guidance from Congress.
“This bill imposes limitations on the President’s authority to suspend or restrict aliens from entering the United States and terminates certain presidential actions implementing such restrictions,” a summary of the legislation reads.
The legislation would mandate Trump “only issue a restriction when required to address a compelling government interest,” though that interest is not defined. Before imposing a travel ban, Trump would have to “consult with Congress,” the legislation dictates.
Likewise, Democrat Senators Christopher Murphy (D-CT), Christopher Coons (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced legislation to stop Trump’s recent expansion of a travel ban on some legal immigration from Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Sudan, along with Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.
The legislation states:
No funds, resources, or fees made available to the Secretary of Homeland Security, or to any other official of a Federal agency, by any Act of Congress for any fiscal year may be used to implement or enforce Presidential Proclamation 9983 … which restricts the entry into the United States of nationals of certain countries.
The effort to end America’s ability to implement travel bans comes as the number of coronavirus cases hits 1,107 nationwide, including 32 deaths.
Democrats’ fight to keep U.S. borders open to the world during the spread of the coronavirus was echoed by 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) this week when he explicitly said he would not close America’s borders to protect Americans from the coronavirus.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) says.
During a speech to Young America’s Foundation’s 41st annual National Conservative Student Conference, Hawley slammed the “reigning consensus” of Washington, D.C.’s ruling class that asserts free trade and endless immigration are vital to meet the needs of corporate leaders, the business lobby, and the donor class while ignoring its impact on middle-class Americans.
Hawley said:
This sort of reigning consensus, the conventional wisdom of the leadership elite tells us things like patriotism are dangerous, too much emphasis on patriotism and nationalism, and the good things about America, that’s narrow-minded, that could even be bigotted… [Emphasis added] The same consensus says that we need to pursue and embrace economic globalization and economic integration at all costs — open markets, open borders, open trade, open everything no matter whether it’s actually good for American national security or for American workers or for American families or for American principles. [Emphasis added] These are the same people who tell us we need to have open immigration at whatever levels so that we can have more labor in the country that unfortunately drives down … wages for working Americans. These are the same people who want you on your college campuses to not say anything that offends anybody for heaven’s sake, who say that we can’t use trigger words … this is the elite consensus that has governed our politics for too long and what it has produced is a politics of elite ambition. [Emphasis added]
Hawley said the ruling class and their allies in the corporate class have long advocated national policies that help Americans become like them — that is, moving to metropolis cities on the coasts, taking corporate jobs, and leaving behind the traditions of faith, family, and community.
“Here’s what our leaders have said to the country and to the middle of America, they’ve said that ‘If you want to go and start a tech company in Silicon Valley, then we’re all for you,'” Hawley said.
“‘If you want to become elite, like us, go to an elite university, go to an elite graduate school, and embrace our elite point-of-view on the world,'” Hawley said the ruling class’s opinions of the middle class.
“‘If you want to put career achievement over community, if you think that change is more important than tradition, if you are skeptical of things like faith and family, that’s great. If that’s the views that you hold, that’s great for you, and our politics will help you get there. It’ll help you succeed.'”
Americans who choose a different route, Hawley said, are ostracized and looked down upon. Hawley asked:
But what if your ambition is not to start a tech company? What if your ambition is to work in the family business. What if your ambition is to raise a family in the town where you grew up? What if your ambition is to create something that you can pass on to your kids? What if one of your most prized values is your love of this country and believe that we are a good and decent people whose heritage is worth celebrating? What if that’s you? Well, if it is, then this town and the leadership of this country has said, ‘You’re on your own. And you’re either backward or you’re just pathetic, but we don’t have anything to say to you,’ And it is time for that to change. And the 2016 represents, I believe, the people of this country from the middle of our society — the backbone of the country — saying, ‘We want to be heard, we want to be respected, we want this country to stand for the principles it was founded on and we’re going to do something about it.’ And that’s our challenge now.”
For decades, free trade has helped gut working and middle-class jobs and stripped whole middle American towns of their industries and livelihoods. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed and China was allowed to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), nearly five million American manufacturing jobs and 50,000 manufacturing facilities have been eliminated from the U.S. economy.
Meanwhile, the Washington, DC-imposed mass immigration policy — where more than 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign workers are admitted to the U.S. to compete against Americans every year — has been a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates, as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an occupation’s labor force reduces Americans’ hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans’ overall wages by 0.8 percent.

The analogy is bad enough, however, that it certainly shouldn’t be on the president’s Twitter feed.
Actually, the analogy was so bad even Couy Griffin, the man who made it, conceded, “I could’ve chosen a different verbiage, you know. I guess I need to be more careful when I choose the words that I speak.”
At a May 17 rally, Griffin, the head of Cowboys for Trump, said, “I’ve come to the conclusion that the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat. I don’t say that in the physical sense, and I can already see the videos getting edited where it says [unintelligible] go murder Democrats. No, I say that in the political sense, because the Democratic agenda and policy is anti-American right now.”
The comment led to predictably misleading coverage in The Daily Beast. Cowboys For Trump posted an extended video of Griffin’s remarks on Twitter, showing the quote in fuller context, and declaring the Beast’s coverage “fake news.”

He does not want Democrats to die. The sky isn’t falling because Trump made a bad retweet. This is not a death blow to the country’s soul.
It is, however, a dangerous sentiment for the president to elevate with his platform. In the video, Griffin’s “only good Democrat is a dead Democrat” line draws cheers and applause before he even clarifies that it wasn’t meant “in a physical sense.” I’m not sure anyone who clapped seriously supports slaughtering Democrats, or believes Democrats are better dead than alive. Trump, once a longtime supporter of Democrats, obviously does not.
Still, it’s unhealthy for the president to spread language that bluntly extreme against his opposing party. It shouldn’t be normalized and it shouldn’t stay on his feed, an ostensible endorsement of unnecessarily extreme rhetoric that could help nudge it into the mainstream.
An edited video of Trump body slamming CNN? Who cares. It’s a joke. Sanctimonious complaints against Trump’s unorthodox presidential conduct are rarely constructive, so I’ll leave that to the folks in the corporate media. I’m not saying Trump has to issue an apology, I just think he should take the tweet down. It’s wrong, and that’s worth saying.","['daily', 'chorus', 'outrage', 'feigning', 'shock', 'combative']"

To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States.
In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China.
For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival.
When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them.
Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner.

They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.,https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/23/how-anti-white-rhetoric-is-fueling-white-nationalism/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,62.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea.
I opened Twitter recently and saw 20+ notifications. Most of the time that means the new generation of white nationalist Twitter trolls are filling my feed with racist and anti-Semitic cartoons. It was the trolls, but this was different. They were celebrating my use of the word “anti-white” in a tweet. They saw it as a victory that a “mainstream conservative” was using this term that for so long has been their calling card.
They had a point. Until recently I would have been unlikely to use the term. Not because I didn’t believe some people harbored animosity towards whites, but because that was a fringe attitude removed from power, which represented little real threat. That is no longer the case. Progressive rhetoric on race has turned an ugly corner and the existence of “anti-white” attitudes can no longer be ignored.
In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Loosely backed up by historical inequities and disparities in mass shootings, this position has begun to take a serious foothold.
Don’t Ask White People to Be More Tribal
Strikingly, this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.
Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race.
White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. The last thing our society needs is for white people to feel more tribal. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.
A big part of the reason white Americans have been willing to go along with policies that are prejudicial on their face, such as affirmative action, is that they do not view themselves as a tribe. Given the inequality of resources favoring whites in our society, it is a good thing that white people view themselves as the ones without an accent. Should that change, white privilege (whatever one views that to be) will not be eviscerated—it will be entrenched.
The Tipping Point of Whiteness
All of this comes at a time when the last immigrants from the great wave of white immigration from 1850-1920 have died off. In the past, most whites identified with their European ethnicity: Irish, Italian, German, etc. As white people gravitate away from such identities, many see themselves as a neutral, “non racial” population. The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as “white,” but it is far preferable to the alternative: an American white population that views itself as a special-interest group.
The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as ‘white,’ but it is far preferable to the alternative.
The recurring, tired refrain that we should have a white history month if there is a black history month, or white student unions on campuses, is unintentionally being given new life by the Left. Celebrations or organizations of whiteness do not exist because we don’t need them. White people do not face the same kinds of systemic discrimination that people of color do. But progressives are doing a very good job of convincing white people that they do.
When parents of Virginia high school students complained about a white privilege video being shown to their kids, they rightfully noted that their kids were being singled out based on their race. The video featured a foot race in which people of color were burdened by impediments while the white people ran free. It was absolutely fair for them to interpret this as a message to their kids saying, “Your accomplishments are easier and less valuable than those of your peers of color.”
Many parents object to this method of teaching about race relations. While some white people, especially those in the academy and the arts, find the acceptance of privilege and its associated guilt liberating, many do not. Privilege theory is also not being offered as one of many ways to confront and consider racism; it is being offered as the central way. This was brilliantly explored in 2010 by the Midwestern Critical Whiteness Collective’s (MCWC’s) article in Harvard Education Review, “McIntosh as Synecdoche: How Teacher Education Focus on White Privilege Undermines Anti Racism.”
Privilege Theory Is the Wrong Track
The McIntosh in question is Peggy McIntosh, whose 1988 essay “Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack” formed the foundation of privilege theory. The essay is mostly a list of ways in which white people receive better treatment in society. The MCWC describes McIntosh’s theory as a synecdoche because it has come to define the totality of education’s anti-racism efforts. It is meant to be the magic pill that clarifies things and sets us on the right course once consumed.
Many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.
They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. One case study involved an education student named John, from a small, non-diverse town. In his final essay for the class John explained his reaction to McIntosh: “I got the feeling from it that it was more about trying to make white males feel guilty for things they most likely had no control over. Being a white male I got a little worked up about the whole list since I don’t feel like I have anything to apologize for.”
John rolled his eyes at privilege theory. However, his teacher reported that other ways of exploring racism and multiculturalism such as films on race relations and historical texts broadened John’s empathy towards non-white people. John was able to reject confession while still becoming a better anti-racist educator. This made John’s teacher wonder whether confessional white privilege is the universally beneficial educational tool it is made out to be. The collective found that it is not.
In its blunt conclusion, the collective writes: “McIntosh’s conception of white privilege has been at the center of anti-racist thought and action in teacher education. We argue, however, that McIntosh’s ideas simplify white racial identity in dangerous ways. We also demonstrate that white privilege pedagogy demands confession, but that confession is a dead end. Finally, we propose that white supremacy needs to replace white privilege as the central concern of our anti-racist efforts.”
Abetting White Supremacy
When privilege theory took root in the 1990s, society roundly condemned the outward expression of racist attitudes. This is why the focus shifted to the ways in which white people were racist without even knowing it. Importantly, all white people were guilty of this form of racism. The act of confessing privilege became the means through which white people discovered this hidden racism.
The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
But, as the past year has shown us, good old-fashioned white supremacy was not gone; it was simply driven underground. Not only was white supremacy still extant, it was going more or less unaddressed. The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
One can teach against white supremacy by encouraging students to treat everyone as equal, or at least as individuals not defined in important ways by their race. Privilege theory does not allow for this approach. It demands that differences be front and center and that we always consider a person’s race in considering him. This focus on “valuing differences” over “the colorblind model” unlocked the door to the white supremacist revival that today’s anti-white rhetoric has kicked open.
White Grievance On the Rise
It surprises many people that an increasing number of white Americans over the past decade believe whites face more discrimination than blacks. Obviously this feeling is inconsistent with economic data. Many have argued that a white fear of losing the dominant economic place in society is behind this belief. But what if the discrimination that white people are feeling and expressing is not primarily economic in nature?
He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way.
This brings us back to John. What got him “worked up” about privilege theory was not that he’d have to compete for jobs with minorities. He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way. Moreover, many resent the pedagogical transformations that their history and culture are undergoing. White historical figures once held in too high esteem have swung the other way into utter disrepute. Also, the histories of no other peoples are being held to these lofty standards.
Mohandas Gandhi’s racism, the Black Panthers’ vicious murders, and Santa Anna’s barbarism are understood within the context of their positive contributions. Increasingly, white Americans perceive that Columbus, Jefferson, Jackson, and many other core white historical figures are consistently brought down a peg in order to decentralize whiteness in history. This assault on their history has a deeper impact than many on the Left are aware of, or willing to admit.
Rise of the White Race Baiters
The combination of the confessional and universal aspects of white privilege and the reconstruction of white history has opened the door for white racial grievance-mongers. From 2014 to 2015, the number of active Klu Klux Klan chapters in the United States grew from 72 to 190, a massive increase for a group so closely associated with hatred. Along with these organized efforts, social media has given a dangerous new platform to white supremacists.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers, specifically on college campuses. Conservative media seize upon disputes over the cultural appropriation of taco night or banning hoopskirts as evidence that minority racial grievance has gotten unhinged.
In emerging white nationalist journals such as Radix, this constant drumbeat of attack against white insensitivity is viewed gravely. What results is a belief among a growing number of whites in the concepts of “white genocide” and “racial realism.”
Both “white genocide” and “racial realism” harken back to the worst elements of American racial history. The former reacts in horror to the races mixing sexually for fear of resulting offspring being impure. The latter pretends to take a cold, scientific look at demography to prove the superiority of the white race. Ideas of this ilk, until recently thought to be confined to a fringe dustbin, have taken on new life in our hyper-racialized society.
Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. They are very aware of the dichotomy between non-white culture, which must be valued at all times (even in the midst of terror attacks), and white culture, which must be criticized and devalued. They don’t like it.
Same Tactics, Different Sides
The result of these societal double standards is for many a desire to lash out against it. For every white college student who dutifully accepts his privilege, many more resent the idea and wish to fight it. The sharpest arrow in their quiver is to be offensive.
In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
This desire to be offensive has given rise to the “alt right.” Supporters of this loosely assembled white nationalist movement understand a playful aspect to its use of slurs. But just as the Left shifted from using anti-white rhetoric as an ironic device to an actual indictment of white culture, so has the alt right come to believe much of its troubling rhetoric.
Do the alt right Twitter trolls really want Jews turned into lampshades, or believe blacks are apes? Many of their supporters say no, that such rhetoric is simply meant to shock the system. They feel oppressed by political correctness and they challenge it, in over-the-top, offensive ways.
If this seems familiar, it should. It is exactly the same approach taken by social justice warriors and purveyors of anti-white rhetoric. The shocking “White Men Are Bad” hot takes serve the same purpose. They are also meant to shock the system. Just as the alt right is willing to denigrate minorities to make plain what they view as racist speech codes, the Left is willing to denigrate straight, white men to make plain what they view as widespread systemic racism.
For both groups the central theme is identity. That theme quickly calcifies into attitudes too brittle to hold up serious discourse. In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
Let’s Find Another Way Forward
W.E.B. Du Bois was born just three years after the end of slavery, but was bullish on the prospects of equality, he writes in “The Souls of Black Folks.”
Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic…
Modern progressives don’t talk about the “greater ideals of the American Republic.” Rather, those ideals have become suspect, empty words used to justify slavery and genocide. But for Du Bois, who was closer to slavery than any of us will ever be, this was not the case. The facile notion that some inherent evil of whiteness must be expunged is anathema to his entire vision of equality and reconciliation.
Put simply, our anti-racism efforts must be refocused away from guilt and confession and towards equality and eradicating irrational judgments based on race. Some on the Left will object, saying that racism is so systemic in society it must be purged before anyone can pretend to treat of others without taking race into account. Some on the Right will object, saying that everything from IQ tests to crime statistics prove something meaningful about the capabilities of individuals based on their race.
Both of these perspectives must be rejected. In their place, we must return to the goal of treating people as individuals, not as representatives of their race.","['privileges', 'privilege', 'white']"
"Such a ban would have been of little impact because the key element in such mass attacks is time, and the Virginia Tech attacker had all the time in the world because his targets could not shoot back; they were in a gun-free zone.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/01/hawkins-bloomberg-uses-gun-control-failure-to-push-more-gun-control/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,62.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democrat presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg is running ads that use incidents in which gun control failed to bolster calls for mandating more gun control.
The ads do not mention gun control failures, rather, they simply point to incidents in which guns were used criminally and point to the resulting harm as justification for more gun laws.
For example, Bloomberg is running an ad that uses the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack to push more gun control now. The ad mentions the fact that 32 innocents were killed in the firearm-based attack but says nothing about the fact that the attack occurred in a gun-free zone. In other words, that attack occurred in an area with 100 percent gun control.
Moreover, the ad says nothing about the fact that the attacker used handguns, not an “assault weapon.” And the ad does not inform viewers that the attacker passed a background check to acquire the guns.
None of these failures are evident in Bloomberg’s ad. Instead, the focus is on how much gun control would supposedly make us safer:
In 2007, a gunman killed 32 people and wounded over a dozen others at Virginia Tech — including Colin Goddard. By making sure that guns don't fall into the wrong hands, we can save lives. Mike plans to do just that: https://t.co/rFldrBeb4H pic.twitter.com/qH6ZOEMWBk — Team Bloomberg (@Mike2020) January 31, 2020
Ironically, bans on “high-capacity” magazines are part of the Bloomberg campaign’s gun control push, yet a Virginia Tech review board found that such a ban would have had a negligible impact on the results of the 2007 attack.
On December 30, 2012, Breitbart News reported the review board’s finding that a ban forcing the attacker to use ten-round magazines instead of those that hold 15 rounds “would have not made that much difference in the incident.”
Such a ban would have been of little impact because the key element in such mass attacks is time, and the Virginia Tech attacker had all the time in the world because his targets could not shoot back; they were in a gun-free zone. In this sense, gun control actually contributed to the severity of the attack results.
But Bloomberg is pushing more gun control.","['little', 'impact', 'zone']"

Bush and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) will not support President Donald Trump’s re-election in November, according to a report.
The New York Times reports:
Former President George W. Bush won’t support the re-election of Mr. Trump, and Jeb Bush isn’t sure how he’ll vote, say people familiar with their thinking. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah won’t back Mr. Trump and is deliberating whether to again write in his wife, Ann, or cast another ballot this November. And Cindy McCain, the widow of Senator John McCain, is almost certain to support Mr. Biden but is unsure how public to be about it because one of her sons is eying a run for office. […] Former Republican leaders like the former Speakers Paul D. Ryan and John A. Boehner won’t say how they will vote, and some Republicans who are already disinclined to support Mr. Trump are weighing whether to go beyond backing a third-party contender to openly endorse Mr. Biden.
In a statement to the Texas Tribune, a spokesperson for Bush denied the Times‘ report, saying: “This is completely made up. He is retired from presidential politics and has not indicated how he will vote.”
Bush, who has largely avoided politics since leaving office in 2009, has recently weighed in on the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the death of George Floyd — and while neither statement mentioned President Trump by name, they were regarded as veiled swipes at his handling of both matters.
In May, Bush published a video message urging for unity and togetherness amid the outbreak, saying Americans are all God’s children and deserve equal treatment.
“[L]et us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat,” he said. “In the final analysis we are not partisan combatants, we are human beings equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God. We rise or fall together, and we are determined to rise.”
Shortly after, President Trump hit back at Bush with a reminder that the former president failed to defend him during his impeachment trial, saying: “He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!”
On Tuesday, Bush, along with the former first lady, Laura Bush, said in a statement that they were “anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.”
“Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures — and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths,” the couple added.
On Monday, former Bush Treasury Department official Karen Kirksey launched a super PAC in support of former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
The group, named 43 Alumni For Biden, lists Kirksey as its custodian of records and group’s treasurer.
Romney was the sole Republican senator to convict President Trump in the upper chamber’s impeachment trial.","['swipes', 'veiled']"

A plan known as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act introduced in the Senate by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), as well as Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), would eliminate the U.S. country caps in the legal immigration system that would fast track outsourcing of white-collar American jobs to mostly Indian and Chinese nationals imported to the country by businesses, outsourcing firms, and multinational corporations.
The country caps were originally implemented to prevent any one country from monopolizing the legal immigration system. Eliminating the country caps would immediately fast track up to 300,000 green cards, and eventually American citizenship, to primarily Indian nationals in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, so long as they agree to take high-paying white-collar jobs from Americans.
In the process, not only would other foreign workers be crowded out from receiving employment-based green cards, but the elimination of the country caps would fast track the outsourcing of high-paying American jobs that would otherwise go to U.S. graduates.
The Kochs’ Libre Initiative organization has announced their support for the mass middle-class outsourcing scheme, with the group’s president Daniel Garza saying in a statement:
We thank Senators Lee and Harris, as well as Representatives Lofgren and Buck, for introducing this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to eliminate an unfair policy that favors high-skilled workers from one nation over another. According to a recent estimate, workers from some countries will have to wait more than 150 years to obtain a green card, while others face no wait at all. This unfair system makes no sense, which is why there is such broad support in both the House and Senate to eliminate it. [Emphasis added] This is a good step towards positive reform of our immigration laws. Congress should consider bills like this, which will help deliver a more transparent, efficient, and navigable system that welcomes immigrants who will contribute to this country. We hope leaders will move promptly to debate and pass this worthwhile legislation. [Emphasis added]
There has been an enormous effort by Republicans and Democrats — including Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Corey Gardner (R-CO) — to ram the plan through Congress with huge donor class support.

The plan is a boon to Silicon Valley billionaires, big business elites, and outsourcing firms, as they would be able to readily import more lower-paid Indian and Chinese foreign workers to take American jobs that would have otherwise gone to American citizens.
Experts have said that should the country caps be eliminated, India would be able to monopolize the country’s legal immigration system for the next ten years. After that decade of an Indian-first legal immigration system, the legal immigration flow from India to the U.S. would likely stabilize to make up around 75 percent of all employment-based legal immigration.
Likewise, U.S. employers would be incentivized to more readily outsource American jobs through the H-1B visa and the L-1 visa programs.
The nation’s workforce now includes roughly 1.5 million foreign visa workers who are imported via the H-1B, L-1, OPT, O-1, J-1, and other visa programs. These outsourcing workers are not immigrants, but rather contract workers hired for one to six years, at lower wages, to take U.S. jobs that would otherwise go to American graduates.
Every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an American workers’ occupation reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta concludes. This means the average native-born American worker today has their wage reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.
Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent. Should 15 percent of low-skilled jobs be held by foreign-born workers, it would reduce the wages of native-born American workers by perhaps 12 percent.
Overall, four million young Americans enter the workforce every year, but their job opportunities are further diminished as there are roughly two new foreign workers for every four American workers who enter the workforce.

Frustrated Democrats slammed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care. ,https://www.breitbart.com/news/outraged-democrats-vow-to-challenge-court-ruling-undercutting-obamacare/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,62.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Washington (AFP) – Outraged Democrats vowed to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that could undo the US health care law known as Obamacare, saying on Saturday that they will use their new power in Congress to hold Republicans responsible and “expose their lies.”
US District Judge Reed O’Connor ruled Friday that the health care law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is unconstitutional.
The White House said it expects the ruling to be appealed to the Supreme Court. For now, it said in a statement, “the law remains in place.”
But Democrats, who have seen the law survive scores of legal and legislative attacks, vowed to fight back, saying health coverage of millions of Americans is at stake.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Republicans had pretended to care about those protected by Obamacare “while quietly trying to remove that support in the courts. Next year, we will force votes to expose their lies.”
Democrats see the law as a signature achievement of former president Barack Obama, while Republicans dismiss it as governmental overreach. Donald Trump made abolishing and replacing the program a central pledge of his presidential campaign.
In a separate Obamacare case in 2012, five justices in the nine-judge Supreme Court upheld the law. All five remain on the court.
Still, it remains unclear how they might rule in the new case which, if left to stand, has the potential for enormous disruption to the US health care system.
In his ruling Friday, the Texas-based judge said that the full Obamacare program was unconstitutional because Congress, in its 2017 tax overhaul, eliminated a penalty for anyone lacking health insurance who failed to sign up for the program.
The 2012 case was over whether such a penalty was legal — but now that it is gone, O’Connor said, the whole ACA should be stricken down because that provision is “the keystone” of the program.
Trump lost no time in tweeting his delight at the court’s ruling on a complaint brought by several Republican attorneys general and two Republican governors.
“Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
“As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster!” he said.
Trump urged the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the House of Representatives speaker-designate, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, to “pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare.”
– ‘Monstrous endgame’ –
The court ruling came on the eve of the deadline for people to sign up for ACA coverage for 2019.
Angry Democrats blamed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care.
Republicans “know that they can’t repeal the ACA in Congress. So they’ve continued their crusade through the courts,” tweeted Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a consumer-protection activist. “The ACA is still the law of the land.”
Polls consistently show strong public support for the ACA guarantee of coverage regardless of pre-existing health conditions — an issue Democrats used with great success in last month’s midterm elections as they won control of the House of Representatives.
“#Republicans’ legal crusade against the #AffordableCareAct is a political stunt, but a dangerous one that puts health coverage and vital health protections for millions of Americans at risk,” Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tweeted Saturday.
“They found one judge to agree, and now Medicaid expansion could be gone, pre-existing condition protections could be wiped out, prices skyrocket and millions lose insurance. And they call that success,” Democratic congressman Joe Kennedy wrote on the social media site.
O’Connor’s late Friday ruling “exposes the monstrous endgame of Republicans’ all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans’ access to affordable health care,” Pelosi said in a statement.
While the court’s “absurd ruling will be immediately appealed, Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision,” she said.
She vowed that when Democrats take control of the House in January, lawmakers “will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process” to uphold Obamacare.
Opposing the Republican lawsuit were 17 Democratic attorneys general led by Xavier Becerra of California.
They argue that the tax law changes do not mean that the whole Affordable Care Act becomes unconstitutional.
The Texas ruling “is an assault on 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions” and on all who rely on Obamacare coverage, Becerra said in a statement. “Our fight to save Obamacare is far from over,” he tweeted.","['Frustrated', 'debacle', 'slammed']"
"This is what Breitbart News has reported, based on publicly available data ignored by the anti-tariff crowd for over a year. ",https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/01/17/washington-post-tariffs-did-not-raise-prices/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,62.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It’s been a long haul. But finally, the truth about tariffs has become unavoidable.
For over 18 months, Breitbart News has been reporting that consumer prices were not significantly rising due to tariffs. We have been virtually alone in this reporting among news organizations, although Alan Tonelson has done a fine job of sifting through the data on his own. Every corporate mainstream media organization has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tariffs were hurting U.S. consumers.
But now the facts have become undeniable even for the mainstream media. On Friday, the Washington Post published a piece by reporter Heather Long explaining that the predictions of consumers paying higher prices because of tariffs were just wrong.
“Gail Ross can tell you two things with certainty: Americans, not the Chinese, are paying for President Trump’s tariffs. And second, most of the costs were absorbed by U.S. companies, which is why consumers haven’t seen excessive sticker shock at stores,” Long writes.
This is what Breitbart News has reported, based on publicly available data ignored by the anti-tariff crowd for over a year. U.S. companies, their bottom lines boosted by Trump’s tax cuts, have absorbed most of the tariffs instead of passing them on to U.S. households.
“Although many big corporations reacted to the announcement of tariffs with warnings that consumers would be forced to pay higher prices, the evidence so far is that corporations have been forced to absorb the costs of tariffs rather than passing them on. Instead of squeezing the pocketbooks of American households, the tariffs are putting pressure on record-high corporate profits,” Breitbart News reported in May 2018.
Now we get this from the Washington Post:
Headlines last year proclaimed Trump’s tariffs could cost the typical American family $1,000 more a year. The eye-popping number came from a JPMorgan analysis that assumed the full cost of the tariffs would be passed on to consumers, which is what is generally taught in introductory economics classes. But that is not what’s been happening. The evidence so far indicates that most American firms passed only a fraction of the cost increase on to consumers — more in the range of $100 per family a year… But a recent study by economists at Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston went a step further, examining data from two large retailers on prices of similar goods, some of which face tariffs and some that do not. The economists found a “quite modest” price difference, suggesting that U.S. companies and retailers are eating a lot of the costs and making lower profits. The price hike for affected dishes, furniture, linens, toaster ovens, towels and umbrellas was less than 1 percent, the study found. And the price for electronics only went up by 1.4 percent.
This is a significant breakthrough. Each new round of tariff was greeted with panicky headlines predicting that U.S. consumers would be squeezed by rising prices as retailers and importers passed the cost of tariffs on to shoppers.
“Trump’s trade war may soon hit consumers’ wallets and paychecks,” NBC News declared in a headline last year.
“Tariffs will surely lead to higher prices for imported goods and, to a lesser extent, prices for non-imported goods that use imported materials,” the University of Pennsylvania’s business school Wharton reported.
“Tariffs are about to hit consumers, and it won’t be pretty,” CNBC claimed.
“Trade restrictions, by their nature, result in price increases for the goods in question. If the price of steel and aluminum goes up, manufacturers will be forced to pass those costs onto American consumers,” wrote Tori K. Whiting, the Jay Van Andel Trade Economist at the Heritage Foundation’s Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies.
This was a major failing by the American media, misleading the American people for over a year-and-a-half about the effects of tariffs.
Breitbart readers, of course, knew the true story all along.","['ignored', 'anti-tariff', 'crowd']"
"There was no immediate confirmation from US officials about the alleged plan to slash US troop numbers in Germany and cap them at 25,000 in future. But Trump’s lukewarm support of longstanding cooperation agreements with European allies has long caused alarm on the continent.",https://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-plan-to-slash-us-troops-sparks-concern-in-germany/,breitbart,trump-presidency,right,62.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Frankfurt am Main (AFP) – Germany on Sunday voiced concern at reports that President Donald Trump plans to cut the number of US troops stationed in Germany, amid fears it could weaken a key pillar of NATO defence in the region.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said both countries stood to gain from close cooperation even if the transatlantic relationship had become “complicated” under Trump.
Other senior politicians in Berlin were more blunt, slamming the plan as the latest blow to US-German ties and a potential security risk.
“Should it come to the withdrawal of part of the US troops, we take note of this,” Maas told the Bild am Sonntag daily.
“We appreciate the cooperation with the US armed forces that has grown over decades. It is in the interest of both of our countries.”
Peter Beyer, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coordinator for transatlantic relations, warned that “the German-US relationship could be severely affected” by Trump’s decision.
The Wall Street Journal and other media reported on Friday that Trump had ordered the Pentagon to slash the number of US military personnel by 9,500 from the current 34,500 permanently assigned in Germany.
Such a move would significantly reduce the US commitment to European defence under the NATO umbrella, and appeared to catch Berlin off guard.
‘Wake-up call’
But Maas admitted ties with the Trump administration had become strained.
“We are close partners in the transatlantic alliance. But it’s complicated,” Maas told Bild, in a nod to rows ranging from the Iranian nuclear deal to NATO contributions and Berlin’s support for a Russian gas pipeline.
There was no immediate confirmation from US officials about the alleged plan to slash US troop numbers in Germany and cap them at 25,000 in future.
But Trump’s lukewarm support of longstanding cooperation agreements with European allies has long caused alarm on the continent.
The US leader been particularly scathing towards Germany in recent years, accusing the fellow NATO member of not spending enough on defence.
Germany hosts more US troops than any other country in Europe, a legacy of the Allied occupation after World War II.
Johann Wadephul, a senior member in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party, said the troop reduction plan should showed that the Trump administration was “neglecting an elementary leadership task: involving alliance partners in the decision-making process”.
It also served as another “wake-up call” for Europeans to take more responsibility for their own defence, he said in a statement on Saturday.
Only China and Russia stood to gain from “discord” between NATO allies, Wadephul added.
‘Colossal mistake’
Rolf Muetzenich, leader of the parliamentary group of the centre-left SPD, Merkel’s junior coalition partner, told the Funke newspaper group that the US plan could lead to “a lasting realignment of security policy in Europe”.
Former US Army Europe commander Ben Hodges, who was stationed in the German city of Wiesbaden before he retired, said a US drawdown would be “a colossal mistake” and “a gift” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“US troops are not in Europe to protect Germans,” he tweeted. “They are forward-based, as part of NATO, to protect all members, including USA.”
Although the American military presence has strongly declined since the end of the Cold War nearly three decades ago, Germany remains a crucial hub for US armed forces.
As well as serving as a deterrence to a resurgent Russia, US troops use their German bases to coordinate military operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
The headquarters for US forces in Europe and Africa are both based in Stuttgart, while the US air base in Ramstein plays a major role in transporting soldiers and equipment to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Biden was speaking in the wake of the April jobs report, which reported that 20.5 million Americans had lost their jobs that month, spiking unemployment to 14.7% (from a 50-year low of 3.5% just two months before).
Holding a face mask draped over a pen in his left hand, and reading from a script evidently placed slightly off-camera, Biden labored through a presentation that sought to portray Trump as a plutocrat serving his cronies.
He claimed that Trump’s economic policies had “three unmistakable failings.” First, he said, Trump viewed the economy “only” through the stock market’s performance, claiming Trump had delayed reacting to the virus “to protect the Dow Jones average.” Second, he said, Trump’s “entire economic strategy is focused on helping the wealthy and big corporations,” citing the 2017 tax reform bill (which, in fact, raised taxes on the rich in places). He claimed Trump had created incentives to shift jobs overseas (when, in fact, Trump had done the opposite).
Third, Biden said, Trump had failed the middle class. He claimed Trump had neglected the “unforgotten middle class” — then corrected himself, declaring that Trump “immediately forgot them once he got elected.”
Biden seemed to admit that Trump had started out well, but claimed his economic policies were failing before the coronavirus pandemic struck: “The numbers looked good, but underneath those numbers, things were eroding.”
He accused Trump of running a “corrupt recovery,” alleging that the president had steered relief funds to his political donors and cronies, while the “mom and pop shops that needed help got the most shut out.”
Biden did not offer an alternative plan of his own. He promised to produce a “detailed plan” at a later time, promising that it would be devoted to “rebuilding the backbone of this country: a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class.” His economic plan would include “making sure everyone has paid sick leave, and child care support,” Biden said, and would “rip out race-based inequities from every part of our society.”
“We can choose who our economy … works for: just the wealthy, or everyone else as well,” Biden concluded.

"But instead of closing loopholes that allow criminals to access firearms, the bill by House Democrats could turn millions of law-abiding American gun owners into felons.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dem-gun-bill-threatens-to-turn-gun-owners-into-criminals,federalist,gun-control,right,62.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The House of Representatives is expected to vote Wednesday on misguided legislation that supposedly would improve criminal background checks of gun buyers and keep guns out of the hands of criminals. But instead of closing loopholes that allow criminals to access firearms, the bill by House Democrats could turn millions of law-abiding American gun owners into felons.
Yes, you read that right.
The bill is H.R. 8, the “bipartisan” Background Checks Act of 2019. As introduced, the legislation would mandate background checks even when a gun is temporarily transferred from one person or entity to another.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS DENOUNCE DEMOCRATIC MOVE TO TIGHTEN GUN LAWS
This would cover transfers of firearms with historical significance to a museum for public display, a suicidal person who asks a friend to take his guns, or an injured car accident victim who alerts an emergency responder that there is a gun in his vehicle and asks the responder to keep the gun from falling into the wrong hands when the vehicle is towed.
Requiring background checks for temporary transfers of possession would trigger penalties of up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine for merely handing a firearm to another person. Even transferring a firearm to someone during a life-threatening emergency could be deemed a crime by a federal prosecutor or judge if the transfer wasn’t “immediately necessary to prevent … imminent death or great bodily harm.”
House Democrats are taking up a bill that would not have prevented several of the mass shootings that occurred in recent years.
These include the shootings at: Columbine High School in Colorado; Virginia Tech; Fort Hood in Texas; Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut; the Aurora movie theater in Colorado; the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.; the Pulse Nightclub in Florida; the First Baptist Church in Texas; the country concert in Las Vegas; Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina; and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
H.R. 8 fails to prevent gun violence. Over 77 percent of criminals in state prisons for firearm crimes obtained a firearm on the black market, on the street, from a drug dealer, or through theft, according to the Department of Justice.
Stricter gun laws do not always equate to safer cities. Look to Chicago, where Illinois has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. The state earned a B+ rating from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Illinois ranks 8th in the nation for gun law strength.
As the third largest city in the United States, Chicago shoulders much of the state’s violence. Despite stringent laws, Chicago saw more than 530 homicides in 2018 – more than Los Angeles and New York City combined.

House Democrats will continue to carry on about how their bill will “prevent” future gun violence. But H.R. 8 will not prevent gun violence at the hands of criminals. Current law already requires a background check on every commercial gun purchase in America. But that doesn’t fit House Democrats’ narrative.
So instead of working across the aisle to put forward legislation that will get to the root of the real problem, Democrats want to go after our constitutional right to bear arms. House Democrats bring before us H.R. 8 – misguided and careless legislation that turns lawful American citizens into criminals.",['felons']
"But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/12/new-york-times-needs-get-white-supremacy-fetish/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,63.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait like an article arguing white supremacists have an Asian woman fetish.
We used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times, we know it’s just another sinister tool of white supremacy.
Over the past few years, it seems like every week our media-academia complex discovers a new addition to the list of “things that seem completely innocuous but are actually white supremacist.” In recent months, for example, we’ve learned that math, logic, and even square dancing are “weapon[s] of white supremacy.” (You should feel a pang of guilt for every time you do-si-doed in elementary school.)
Here’s their latest hot take: in a recent essay for the New York Times Sunday Review, journalist Audrea Lim argues that “the white supremacists on the far right have ‘yellow fever’ — an Asian woman fetish.” Her evidence boils down to a few anecdotes about the worst-of-the-worst of white nationalism: perennial idiot Richard Spencer thinks Asian girls are “cute” and “smart,” Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin went to a shopping mall with his Filipina girlfriend, and Asian-American porn star Tila Tequila once did a Nazi salute.
To bolster her argument with historical context, Lim even includes a direct quote from Adolf Hitler expressing his admiration for the civilizations of China and Japan. Pro tip: when you’re quoting Hitler, you’re losing the argument.
How About Providing Some Evidence For Those Claims
Certainly, there is a stock character in American life of the lonely, socially awkward, middle-aged white man who wants a “submissive Asian wife.” A feature-length PBS documentary even follows one of these sad sacks in his quest to find a mail-order bride from China. It’s pathetic and trades in racial stereotypes, but that hardly makes it “white supremacist.” In fact, Lim provides no evidence that this phenomenon is even unique to white men, which begs the question: is it really true that white men have an “Asian fetish”?
Lim doesn’t say, but thankfully, we can find detailed statistical information through a simple Google search. According to research by the dating site OkCupid, American men of all racial backgrounds find Asian women highly attractive. In fact, Asian-American women are the only racial group to score net positive ratings from men of all ethnic groups.
If you think about it, Lim’s argument is bizarre. If someone told me Italians were the most handsome, creative, and intelligent people in the world, I would click my heels, praise their good sense, and go about my day. But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success.
More deeply, however, Lim’s argument is that the very idea that Asians are “civilized, advanced and highly intelligent … [has] roots in white supremacy.” Really? I worked as a journalist in China for more than a year, and it was clear to me that the Chinese think of themselves as civilized, advanced, and highly intelligent. If anything, it’s a self-identity that has been accepted, not invented, by the West.
Furthermore, in America, that positive image is a factual reality. Asian-Americans have higher median income and education levels than any other racial group does. Contra Lim, Asian-Americans are not a “model minority,” they’re model citizens with strong family bonds, high educational attainment, and high economic productivity. There’s nothing wrong with that — in fact, it’s a major accomplishment to celebrate.
This Argument Ends In Banning Interracial Marriage
Unfortunately, while the essay sets up the premise that white supremacy lurks at the heart of the relationships between white men and Asian women, it fails to deliver a conclusion. I’ll fill it in for you. If we take Lim’s argument to its logical end (and reject the idea that logic itself is “white supremacist”), maybe she’s suggesting that white men who marry Asian women are, in the language of the sociological literature, “colonizing their bodies.”
Or maybe white men are simply using their privilege as the progenitors of global beauty standards to extend their patriarchal dominance over a favored minority race. Or, to read into Lim’s ominous invocation of Hitler, maybe it’s all a secret plot to resurrect the Axis alliance between the great European and Asian powers. Of course, the author doesn’t go this far — her essay is ridiculous enough — but there’s no way you can accept her premise without concluding at the very least that interracial marriage between white men and Asian women is somehow wrong.
I take this insinuation personally. I’m a white man married to an Asian-American woman. We have two children together. Like the civil rights leaders in the 1960s, I believe interracial marriage is a sign of social progress. At its best, marriage is about human love, which transcends all considerations of race, class, and identity. One might even consider it to be the fullest expression of the idea of e pluribus unum, which I support by any means necessary — through assimilation, marriage, and the bonds of mutual citizenship.
While there may be awkward moments as we traverse the boundaries of ethnic identity, I believe that interracial marriage makes us stronger as a nation and will slowly help stamp out the real racism that still exists in America. Rather than conflate interracial marriage with the poisonous ideology of white supremacy, we should celebrate it as it’s practiced by millions of Americans: as an expression of love, unity, and tolerance.
Articles Like This Make Everything Worse
Ultimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They’re bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them. They’re a miniscule fraction of the population — numbering in the thousands in a nation of 323 million — and deserve to be snubbed out of public life.
Sadly, articles like “white supremacists have an Asian fetish” are counterproductive, bringing them even greater attention and trivializing the real legacy of white supremacy, the original sin of American history. The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater editorial discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait. In the past year, the Times has published articles about a white supremacist’s wedding registry, whether black and white preschoolers can really be friends, and how “nachos” and “Nazi” share the same etymological origin. The coverage has been so over-the-top, you might even say The New York Times has a “white supremacy fetish.”
Luckily, America is moving forward, with or without the Times. Interracial marriage is a fast-rising trend and leading to broader social tolerance. The percentage of multiracial children born in the United States has increased from 1 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 2013. The social taboos against racial mixing have begun to fade and a majority of multiracial Americans are proud of their blended heritage and more open to other cultures.
On a final note of optimism: mixed-race people are actually seen as the most attractive of all racial types. Thus, if this trend continues, we may soon be able to say objectively that America has the most beautiful people in the world. That’s something worth fighting for.","['upside-down', 'victimhood', 'sneaking']"
"Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/05/end-trump-presidency-not-a-chance/,federalist,trump-presidency,right,63.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Never Trumpers are rejoicing that fresh on the heels of COVID, the current riots and unrest will spell the end of the Trump administration. Are they right?
Earlier this week in the Washington Post, George Will declared that the current riots, COVID, and the collective economic fallout are the death knell of the Trump presidency. Will admits Trump is not the genesis of any of the aforementioned crises but blames him for making them worse. Will believes this can, and should, lead to Trump’s downfall.
Until a few months ago, the booming economy made Trump an all-but-unbeatable incumbent. But with the ongoing pandemic and the unrest of recent days, the nation may be swayed by low morale, economic devastation, and loss of confidence in the commander in chief.
Then again, the media continues its deceptive coverage of the riots and accuses all white people of racism—as though Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd’s murders are not repulsive to all Americans. These are the same failed leftist tactics that helped get Trump elected in 2016. If they keep it up, Trump’s defeat may become wishful thinking on the part of those who have never understood Trump’s people or his appeal.
The Left Still Doesn’t Get Trump or the American People
Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them?
Admittedly, Donald Trump is not who I would have chosen for our nation’s highest office. But the fact remains our fellow Americans elected him. He reflects our current political experience. We cannot dismiss Trump and what he stands for without also dismissing the views of the millions of men and women who choose him to be president. Who in their right mind watches these riots and begs for a Biden presidency?
Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Even if Trump loses in November, millions will still want the kind of policies and leadership that Donald Trump gave them. To ignore them is to invite further division and civil unrest.
No One Makes Americans Feel More Understood than Trump
Will’s rant calls to mind a trip I took to NYC with a friend a few months ago. On our drive home, the car stalled. We ended up taking an hour and a half ride in a tow truck to drag the car from Staten Island to Trenton, NJ.
As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. I can only imagine what he thinks of these protests rage through Manhattan and into his neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Here’s why the Never Trumpers can’t succeed: there’s nothing George Will, Joe Biden, or anyone else can say to this tow truck driver to make him feel more understood, validated, and empowered than Donald Trump does. Frankly, they don’t want this man’s support—but Donald Trump does.
After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government.
Can Anything Stop Donald Trump?
There’s another reality the Never Trumpers and the left can’t see: if you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he’s delivered on almost every promise he’s made to you. No, there is no border wall that Mexico has paid for. Still, this is largely the fault of Congress and the judiciary. On issues like deregulation, economic growth, and the federal courts, Trump has exceeded the expectations of his voters.
Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. So long as the left keeps violating Americans’ sense of justice, voters will stick with the guy they trust to restore it.
They’re Not After Trump, They’re After You
Trump himself put it best in a tweet posted last year.
“In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way.”
This is what causes the loyalty that Trump supporters have for their Commander-in-Chief. They recognize that the left’s attacks on Trump are actually attacks on them. Just like the left has attacked Trump for his SCOTUS picks, or pro-life stance, now they’re attacking him for “stoking racial tensions” and accuse him of using “aggressive tactics” to restore law and order.
Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.
After this national tragedy quiets down, there will be no shortage of voices telling the American people that they should be ashamed of themselves. I assure you, Joe Biden will be chief among them. Donald Trump will lose no support if he can keep doing what he’s always done for his loyal followers: make them feel proud to be American.","['blame', 'deflect', 'desecrated', 'apologizer-in-chief']"
"In an apparent attempt to blame sexism for the blowback the Rashida Tlaib received for her ""Impeach the Motherf*cker"" remark, Pelosi wondered aloud what the response would have been if a man made the same comment.

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) over her “impeach the motherfucker” remark is driven by sexism and, while she does not condone the Michigan Democrat’s language, she is “not in the censorship business.”
USA Today Washington Bureau chief Susan Page was on hand at the town hall-style meeting, slated to air on MSNBC this evening, tweeting live updates of Pelosi’s discussion with host Joy Reid. Asked whether Tlaib’s’s call for President Donald Trump to be impeached hurts the Democrats’ “hurts the case,” Pelosi replied: “The enthusiasm that our members have helps the case, any case….We try to build our consensus on how we go forward. It doesn’t hurt the cause when people speak the truth.”
Touching on impeachment moments earlier, Pelosi stated that while “The outrage that people feel about impeachment is legitimate,” it would be premature to move forward with the measure.
Moments later, Pelosi addressed Tlaib’s impeachment remark in which she appeared to excuse the expletive-laden attack on the president, referring to the Palestinian-American lawmaker’s pledge as “generational.”
“I don’t like the language,” the speaker told Reid, later adding, “I’m not in the censorship business.”
In an apparent attempt to blame sexism for the blowback the Tlaib received, Pelosi wondered aloud what the response would have been if a man made the same comment. “What she said is less offensive than what President Trump said about John McCain,” claimed Pelosi.
The California Democrat then went on to say that Tlaib’s remark is “not the position of the Democratic caucus” regarding impeachment. “I think it probably consolidates his [President Trump’s] base, but I don’t think it needs much consolidation,” she added.
Speaking before a Thursday evening reception held by progressive advocacy group MoveOn.org, Tlaib vowed before a raucous crowd that she is going to impeach President Trump. “People love you and you win. And when your son looks at you and says, ‘Momma, look, you won. Bullies don’t win.’ And I said, ‘Baby, they don’t. Because we’re going to go in there and we’re going to impeach the motherfucker,” Tlaib, who was sworn in earlier as congresswoman for Michigan’s 13th Congressional district, said to loud cheers.

In an opinion-editorial co-written with John Bonifaz, the co-founder and president of the advocacy group Free Speech For People, Tlaib laid out what they claim is the constitutional case for impeachment.
“Whether the president was directly involved in a conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere with the 2016 election remains the subject of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. But we do not need to wait on the outcome of that criminal investigation before moving forward now with an inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives on whether the president has committed impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against the state: abuse of power and abuse of the public trust. Each passing day brings new damage to the countless people hurt by this lawless president’s actions,” the pair wrote in the Detroit Free Press. “We cannot undo the trauma that he is causing to our people, and this nation. Those most vulnerable to his administration’s cruelty are counting on us to act—act to remove the president and put this country on a path to true justice.”
Tlaib and Bonifaz pushed back against calls from moderate Democrats that pursuing impeachment would be “politically unwise,” writing “Members of Congress have a sworn duty to preserve our Constitution. Leaving a lawless president in office for political points would be abandoning that duty.”
“Each passing day brings more pain for the people most directly hurt by this president, and these are days we simply cannot get back. The time for impeachment proceedings is now,” the op-ed concluded.
Tlaib stood behind her remark Friday, writing on Twitter that she will “always speak truth to power.”
I will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) January 4, 2019

While Democrats were diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal, the coronavirus pandemic was beginning in China and arriving in the United States.

For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks.
To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States.
In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China.
For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival.
When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them.
Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) spoke at American University Washington College of Law in a speech billed as foreign policy-focused; however, it included criticism of President Donald Trump and his policies and claimed he promotes white nationalism and encourages “domestic right-wing terrorism.”
“He cozies up to white nationalists,” Warren said on Thursday. “He undermines the free press and incites violence against journalists.”
Warren said Trump’s election poses a threat to democracy.
“The 2016 election provided a stark reminder that we must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day,” Warren said. “That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes, and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those – foreign or domestic – who meddle, hack, or undermine them.”
“It means ensuring a meaningful opportunity for every American citizen to vote,” Warren said. “And it means fighting for equal justice and protection under the law for all.”
“It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds, whether in San Bernadino or Charleston, Orlando or Charlottesville, Fort Hood or Pittsburgh,” Warren said. “We must speak plainly about all of these incidents.”
“Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values,” Warren said.
As for her stance on foreign policy in the speech, Warren opposes every aspect of Trump’s approach, saying he “embraces dictators of all stripes,” and she painted a grim picture of the state of global affairs under this president.
“Let’s start with a serious problem: Around the world, democracy is under assault,” Warren said. “Authoritarian governments are gaining power.”
“Right-wing demagogues are gaining strength,” Warren added. “Movements toward openness and pluralism have stalled and begun to reverse.”
“Inequality is rapidly growing, transforming rule by-the-people into rule by-wealthy-elites,” Warren said.
Warren did not mention any of the president’s successes: halting North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons, debilitating ISIS, confronting Iran for funding terrorism around the globe, and unjustly gaining the release of Americans held abroad unjustly.
Instead, she called for cutting a “bloated defense budget” and the halt of “reckless, endless wars in the Middle East.”
Warren’s speech included leftist talking points — from corporations’ alleged mistreatment of American workers and unions to the dangers of “cutthroat capitalism” and the pitfalls of free trade.
She also said she would oppose Trump’s renegotiated NAFTA trade agreement with Mexico and Canada while admitting it needed to be revisited and revised.
“But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers,” Warren said. “It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs.”
She also claims the agreement favors “big drug companies” and does not address climate change.
“For these reasons, I oppose NAFTA 2.0 and will vote against it in the Senate unless President Trump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families,” Warren said.

Newly empowered Democrats in Washington and statehouses across the country are flexing their legislative muscle with a host of tax proposals that would affect billionaires and blue collar alike.,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/Vjs9Fr9BZHs/dems-introduce-host-of-new-tax-proposals-at-state-and-federal-level,fox-news,middle-class,right,64.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Newly empowered Democrats in Washington and statehouses across the country are flexing their legislative muscle with a host of tax proposals that would affect billionaires and blue collar alike.
From D.C. to Sacramento, the controversial levies include everything from a ""wealth tax"" to new charges on ammunition and groceries. Some of these are meant as a deterrent against certain kinds of purchases -- like guns and ammo -- while others are intended to help pay for ambitious new programs.
WEALTH TAX FACES CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS
Here are just some of the proposals being considered since the start of the New Year:
Wealth Tax
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is about to formally launch her Democratic presidential campaign, has proposed a 2 percent tax on net worth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. The proposal is unique in that it targets assets and not income, and has already faced some constitutional questions.
While critics also note it would be difficult to enforce since it would require the government to value assets, the proposal would be estimated to affect about 75,000 households.
The senator has pitched it as targeting those at the tippy-top of the wealth scale, in order to pay for programs like government-backed child care and more.
While Warren targets wealth, other lawmakers have floated the possibility of simply raising the income tax rate for those at the very top. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has pitched, albeit not formally, a 70 percent marginal tax on incomes over $10 million. The democratic socialist lawmaker’s plan is not unprecedented – from 1957 through the 1970s, the tax rate was at 70 percent or higher – but the idea has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans and some moderate Democrats.
OCASIO-CORTEZ DEFENDS CALL FOR 70 PERCENT TAX ON RICH
And billionaires like ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, both of whom are weighing a presidential run, have hit back. Schultz has called a number of the ideas from Democrats “ridiculous,” while Bloomberg last weekend compared Warren’s plan to the type of policy that destroyed Venezuela’s economy.
“We need a healthy economy, and we shouldn’t be embarrassed about our system,” he told reporters during an event in New Hampshire.
""Billionaires like Howard Schultz & Michael Bloomberg want to keep a rigged system in place that benefits only them and their buddies. And they plan to spend gobs of cash to try and buy the Presidency to keep it that way. Not on my watch,"" Warren tweeted.
California Gun Tax
With a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature and a new governor who wants to take a firm stance on gun control, California lawmakers are hoping to quickly pass Assembly Bill 18, which among other things looks to tax the sale of handguns and semiautomatic weapons in order to generate funding for gun control programs.
The bill, which was sponsored by Democratic Assemblyman Marc Levine, would implement “an excise tax on the sales of handguns and semiautomatic rifles” and then hand over the resulting revenue to the California Violence Intervention and Prevention Grant Program (CalVIP).
“California needs to bolster violence prevention initiatives so that they are commensurate with our state’s tough gun laws and as effective as violence prevention programs of other states,” Levine said in a statement earlier this month.
CALIFORNIA VS. TRUMP: NEW STATE LAWS TAKE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHITE HOUSE ENERGY AGENDA
The gun-tax legislation has, unsurprisingly, drawn heavy criticism from gun-rights and hunting groups.
“While the legislation lacks details of how the actual proposal will look, it expresses the intent to place an additional tax on handguns and semi-automatic firearms for distribution to various community-based intervention and prevention programs,” the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action said in a statement. “Once again, lawmakers are saddling lawful gun owners with additional taxes and fees for the misdeeds of criminals.”
Connecticut Ammo Tax
California is not the only state looking at gun-related taxes.
A Democratic Connecticut state legislator introduced a bill on Monday that would raise the tax on ammunition in the state by 50 percent.
""Currently, ammunition is taxed at the same rate as other products, but we want to increase it by 50 percent, because we see it as a prevention measure,"" Rep. Jillian Gilchrest said in a video posted on Twitter. ""For example, if someone were to buy a 50 cartridge box of ammunition, which goes for about $10, it would increase the price to $15.""
Gilchrest goes on to explain that military and law enforcement members would be exempted from the tax, though those exemptions do not appear in an initial draft of the bill posted to the Connecticut state legislature's website.
In a statement Tuesday, the NRA condemned Gilchrest's effort.
“This dreadful legislation punishes law-abiding citizens and makes it harder to learn how to safely use firearms,” the NRA said in a statement posted to Twitter.
Connecticut Grocery Tax
Along with a tax on ammunition, Connecticut is also looking into a possible tax on groceries and prescription drugs.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont is mulling including the tax as part of his administration's first budget proposal due later this month.
While the details of the possible sales tax are unclear, a local report stated that the tax, if implemented, could be set at the current 6.35 percent sales tax, or limited to 2 percent as recommended by a ""fiscal stability commission.""
Even the consideration of such a tax, however, is sparking a backlash against the Democratic governor in the state with a history of high taxes.
“People throughout Connecticut are bracing themselves and their financial plans so they can manage the brunt of Governor Lamont and Connecticut Democrat lawmakers and their new taxes and proposals,” House Republican Leader Themis Klarides told Fox News. “Targeting groceries and medication to generate revenue is a terrible strategy.”
New Jersey 'Rain Tax'
New Jersey residents could be hit with what Republicans are calling a ""rain tax,"" if Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signs newly passed legislation.
The bill, approved by the New Jersey Assembly and the Senate, would allow municipalities to create utilities that can collect fees from homeowners and business owners that have large paved surfaces, like driveways and parking lots. During storms, rainwater mixes with pollutants on those surfaces before running into sewers and drains. The funding from the fees could be used for upgrades to reduce the impact on the environment.
“With all the salt that we’ve had on roads recently, that’s all running into the sewer systems, so you can’t ignore the problems because they don’t go away,” New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney told CBS New York.
The bill would establish a “Clean Stormwater and Floor Reduction Fund,” which would be used for stormwater utilities in the state, as well as water quality monitoring, pollution reduction projects and outreach programs, according to the legislation.
But Republicans have blasted the plan, dubbing it a “rain tax” and complaining the state already has implemented too many costs on residents.
“We all want to protect our environment. We all want to preserve it for future generations, but this is a weighted tax,” Sen. Tom Kean Jr. told CBS New York. “The citizens of New Jersey…really [have] no way to defend themselves against tax increases at local levels.”
Nebraska Beer Tax
It’s not just Democrats who have introduced recent tax proposals.
Two Republican state senators in Nebraska, Tom Briese and Curt Friesen, have introduced two bills that, if enacted, would amount to a 345 percent increase in the tax on beer, wine and liquor.
While the lawmakers contend that the tax would only amount to a 10 cent increase in the price of a mug of beer and is part of the solution to lowering property taxes on the state’s farmers, brewers in the Cornhusker State are not happy.
""We're really scared that if this passes, it will stop the growth of this industry,"" Gabby Ayala, the executive director of the Nebraska Craft Brewers Guild, told the Omaha World-Herald. ""Other states that have high taxes don't have as many breweries — it stops people from wanting to invest and expand.""

Craft brewers in Nebraska argue that their businesses are reviving small communities and are an economic success story in a state heavily reliant on farming.
""These breweries are the only real bright spot in a lot of little towns,"" said Caleb Pollard of Scratchtown Brewing Co. in Ord, a town of 2,100 people.
While the bill has faced some opposition, lawmakers looking into property tax relief proposals say that so-called “sin taxes” – those on alcohol, tobacco and gambling – make sense.
""We do have a property tax crisis in Nebraska,"" Briese told the newspaper. ""The responsible approach to provide immediate and substantial relief is to access other taxes.""

"Bernie Sanders Is Crazy, But The Only Democrat Candidate Voters Actually Like",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/24/bernie-sanders-is-crazy-but-the-only-candidate-voters-actually-like/#.XlQSQ7jGNzU.twitter,federalist,gun-control,right,64.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display.
The results are in, and the socialist swept Nevada. That’s right, Bernie Sanders soared to victory Saturday for his third straight win — first Iowa, then New Hampshire, and now the Silver State. Things are looking pretty good for the Vermont senator, the 2020 presidential front-runner who leads second-place candidate and gaffe-machine Joe Biden by more than 12 points in the latest polls.
Notwithstanding the media’s endless campaign to smear Sanders, his support is stronger than ever — and, it appears, so is he. Despite a health scare in October, Sanders soldiers on determined and forceful at his rallies and on the debate stage. Next to the former vice president, Sanders presents like a spring chicken.
But aside from his physical resilience, how is he doing so well? He’s a 78-year-old white male millionaire seeking the affections of the wokesters, a gruff socialist with bedraggled hair and terrifying policy proposals, a 2016 presidential reject, and a divisive populist — which, in case you hadn’t noticed, we already have one of those.
Sanders praises the radical Green New Deal, champions a Medicare for All plan with a $34 trillion price tag, nods to abortion as a means of population control, and defends bread lines and Fidel Castro’s Cuba. How is this fanatical rerun boomer mopping the floor with a Rhode’s scholar veteran, two progressive women, the other half of the beloved Obama administration, and Michael Bloomberg?
Bernie Sanders, for all his flaws and eccentricities, is a genuine sympathetic leader, a quality the other serious contenders have yet to display. Every time Sanders opens his mouth, I believe he believes everything he’s saying. Unlike Obama-wannabe Buttigieg, Sanders feels real. His authentic brand is a perfect blend of “I wrote the damn bill!” fire and witty one-liners. Passion over pandering. Compassion over calculation. Compared to the other candidates, Sanders is the obvious choice.
Sanders Is So Much Stronger Than Biden
Biden is struggling. With each debate, he appears increasingly frail, lacking the crucial stamina Sanders would bring against President Donald Trump in a general election. Since the beginning, Biden has been grasping at the coattails of America’s first black president and relying on his administration’s laurels related to Obamacare, race relations, gun restrictions, and climate change. He’s flaky, having flip-flopped his stance on China and the Hyde amendment, which bars the use of federal funding for abortion in most circumstances.
Biden’s Hyde reversal was “never a good thing in politics,” said David Axelrod, an Obama senior adviser. “And it raises questions about his own performance and his own steadiness and his campaign’s performance.”
This isn’t to say Sanders’ policy has undergone zero evolution over his long tenure in the public eye. Critics assailed him during the 2016 cycle, saying he flipped on gun control and health care, switching from a state-run model to favoring federal administration. But unlike other 2020 contenders, Sanders says what he means and means what he says, remaining overwhelmingly consistent in his advocacy even if his forecasted outcomes for democratic socialism are irrational.
Biden’s endless lane-changing between moderate and progressive induces unpredictable whiplash. In 2020, voters know Sanders offers a much smoother ride.
Michael Bloomberg Can’t Keep up with Bernie
Speaking of whiplash, let’s talk about Michael Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat. Bloomberg may be outspending every other candidate by vast margins, but his Super Tuesday strategy, resulting in a non-presence in all but the last debate and absence in Iowa and New Hampshire, isn’t a great look.
“In Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states in the presidential nomination process, candidates brave freezing temperatures to get out and shake hands. In those states, voters don’t expect to be won over with ad buys and policy papers, they want to meet the candidates personally and be wooed,” wrote Rich Cromwell in The Federalist this month. “Mike Bloomberg doesn’t have time for that.”
Not the case with Sanders, who called out Bloomberg for his absence. “I didn’t see Mike in Iowa when we were holding town meetings with folks there,” Sanders said. “Didn’t see him in New Hampshire, hey you know what, I didn’t see him here in Nevada. Didn’t see him in South Carolina. But he thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.”
Not to mention, Bloomberg’s first debate showing was abysmal — while Sanders never broke stride, even ripping Bloomberg for his filthy billions.
Sanders Discards Buttigieg and Warren Robotics
At her peak, Elizabeth Warren led Sanders in the polls by 12 full points, and now she trails him by over 16 points. In an intersectionality battle, Warren should come out on top, but she isn’t. And it isn’t as if the two progressive icons are running on vastly different policy platforms.
Unlike Sanders, Warren wreaks of insincerity. If she can’t even be honest about her heritage, how are voters supposed to trust her promises and endless plans? Despite her best efforts to appear nonchalant and relatable — think Instagram beer video — Warren just can’t quite get the authenticity thing down. It’s as if all her rehearsed-to-appear-unrehearsed talking points pass through a cringe machine on the way out of her mouth.

Former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg is another robotics champion. The media has propped up Buttigieg as smooth and articulate, but his once-punchy and polished phrases, such as “future former Republicans” and “God doesn’t belong to a political party,” are tired. The novelty has worn off. Having apparently learned nothing from the failed campaigns of Beto O’Rourke and Julián Castro, Buttigieg continues “Hispandering” in a way that feels forced.

But authenticity matters to voters, and they seem to see it in Sanders. One of Sanders’ volunteers, 33-year-old Shawn Nevarro, thinks of Sanders like a grandfather. “He’s kind of stern, a little grumpy at times. But, at the same time, you really know he’s looking out for you,” Nevarro said recently after a Nevada Spanish-language campaign event. “There is a huge distrust among the Latinx community with the Democratic party that they’re not following through on their promises. … Bernie is the exact opposite. He has a real authenticity.”
That authenticity could shore up the nomination for Bernie Sanders. Wonks in Washington, journalists buzzing around D.C. newsrooms, Twitter pundits, and campaign strategists would all do well to realize most people vote with their gut. They care more about who candidates are than what they say. Donald Trump wasn’t the smoothest candidate in 2016. He didn’t do Instagram lives from his kitchen, didn’t break out in Spanish at his rallies. He made forgotten voters believe he cared about them — because he did. And now Sanders is doing the same. So far, it’s paying off.",['Crazy']
"The irony, of course, is that the exhibit that invites people to throw trash at vacuuming Ivanka Trump lookalike reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against, oversexualizing Ivanka’s body and ignoring her hard work.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/04/art-exhibit-invites-people-throw-trash-vacuuming-ivanka-trump-lookalike/,federalist,gender,right,65.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"“Ivanka Vacuuming” is now a thing in the nation’s capital. Because art, or something.
The exhibit, on display at CulturalDC’s former Flashpoint Gallery in Washington, D.C., is a piece of “performance art” where an Ivanka Trump lookalike wearing a pink dress with bows and stiletto shoes vacuums crumbs off a plush, pink carpet. To make the spectacle interactive, onlookers are encouraged to take crumbs from a pedestal and throw them at her to vacuum up.
“Inspired by a figure whose public persona incorporates an almost comically wide range of feminine identities – daughter, wife, mother, sister, model, working woman, blonde – Ivanka Vacuuming is simultaneously a visual celebration of a contemporary feminine icon; a portrait of our own relationship to that figure; and a questioning of our complicity in her role-playing,” a press release on the project reads. “The public is invited to throw crumbs onto the carpet, watching as Ivanka elegantly vacuums up the mess, her smile never wavering. This process repeats itself for the entire duration of the performance.”
The irony, of course, is that the exhibit reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against, oversexualizing Ivanka’s body and ignoring her hard work. (One can only imagine the feminist rage if it were, say, Michelle Obama on display.)
In addition to mocking Ivanka for her looks, the exhibit demeans the First Daughter’s success as a business woman and White House advisor to that of a woman with a vacuum—as if something’s wrong with that, too. Worse, in the process of shaming stay-at-home mothers, “Ivanka Vacuuming” encourages onlookers to throw trash at her. Again, because “art,” or something.
Therein lies the only interesting insight offered by artist Jennifer Rubell, who is of course female because no male could get away with such sexism masked as art.
“Here is what’s complicated: we enjoy throwing the crumbs for Ivanka to vacuum. That is the icky truth at the center of the work. It’s funny, it’s pleasurable, it makes us feel powerful, and we want to do it more,” Rubell said. “We like having the power to elicit a specific and certain response. Also, we know she’ll keep vacuuming whether we do it or not, so it’s not really our fault, right?”
Rubell is right that under President Donald Trump, Americans get a rise out of insulting the first daughter or anyone who dares to wear a MAGA hat. Therein lies the truth of this exhibit: There’s far more wrong with the person who revels in hurling trash at others than there is with the person who’s willing to pick it up.
Anyone who cares enough to go see “Ivanka Vacuuming” or watch the spectacle on its livestream is likely too blinded by his own hate to realize the joke of the whole thing is actually on them. It’s not Ivanka’s vacuuming that’s the problem, but the heart of the person who feels pleasure from bullying and humiliating others.
It’s more than “icky” to feel this way. It’s immoral. That is why, for “Ivanka Vacuuming,” the real exhibit worth going to see is the people throwing the crumbs, not the person picking them up.","['vacuuming', 'oversexualizing']"

Are they right?
Earlier this week in the Washington Post, George Will declared that the current riots, COVID, and the collective economic fallout are the death knell of the Trump presidency. Will admits Trump is not the genesis of any of the aforementioned crises but blames him for making them worse. Will believes this can, and should, lead to Trump’s downfall.
Until a few months ago, the booming economy made Trump an all-but-unbeatable incumbent. But with the ongoing pandemic and the unrest of recent days, the nation may be swayed by low morale, economic devastation, and loss of confidence in the commander in chief.
Then again, the media continues its deceptive coverage of the riots and accuses all white people of racism—as though Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd’s murders are not repulsive to all Americans. These are the same failed leftist tactics that helped get Trump elected in 2016. If they keep it up, Trump’s defeat may become wishful thinking on the part of those who have never understood Trump’s people or his appeal.
The Left Still Doesn’t Get Trump or the American People
Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them?
Admittedly, Donald Trump is not who I would have chosen for our nation’s highest office. But the fact remains our fellow Americans elected him. He reflects our current political experience. We cannot dismiss Trump and what he stands for without also dismissing the views of the millions of men and women who choose him to be president. Who in their right mind watches these riots and begs for a Biden presidency?
Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Even if Trump loses in November, millions will still want the kind of policies and leadership that Donald Trump gave them. To ignore them is to invite further division and civil unrest.
No One Makes Americans Feel More Understood than Trump
Will’s rant calls to mind a trip I took to NYC with a friend a few months ago. On our drive home, the car stalled. We ended up taking an hour and a half ride in a tow truck to drag the car from Staten Island to Trenton, NJ.
As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. I can only imagine what he thinks of these protests rage through Manhattan and into his neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Here’s why the Never Trumpers can’t succeed: there’s nothing George Will, Joe Biden, or anyone else can say to this tow truck driver to make him feel more understood, validated, and empowered than Donald Trump does. Frankly, they don’t want this man’s support—but Donald Trump does.
After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government.
Can Anything Stop Donald Trump?
There’s another reality the Never Trumpers and the left can’t see: if you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he’s delivered on almost every promise he’s made to you. No, there is no border wall that Mexico has paid for. Still, this is largely the fault of Congress and the judiciary. On issues like deregulation, economic growth, and the federal courts, Trump has exceeded the expectations of his voters.
Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. So long as the left keeps violating Americans’ sense of justice, voters will stick with the guy they trust to restore it.
They’re Not After Trump, They’re After You
Trump himself put it best in a tweet posted last year.
“In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way.”
This is what causes the loyalty that Trump supporters have for their Commander-in-Chief. They recognize that the left’s attacks on Trump are actually attacks on them. Just like the left has attacked Trump for his SCOTUS picks, or pro-life stance, now they’re attacking him for “stoking racial tensions” and accuse him of using “aggressive tactics” to restore law and order.
Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.
After this national tragedy quiets down, there will be no shortage of voices telling the American people that they should be ashamed of themselves. I assure you, Joe Biden will be chief among them. Donald Trump will lose no support if he can keep doing what he’s always done for his loyal followers: make them feel proud to be American.","['berated', 'racist', 'ignorant']"
Democrats Push Pork for Planned Parenthood in Coronavirus Package,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/22/report-democrats-push-for-small-business-assistance-for-planned-parenthood/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,65.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The Hill reported Sunday that one of the reasons bipartisan support for a massive coronavirus stimulus package has fallen apart is, once again, because Democrats want the bill to prop up Planned Parenthood.
According to the Hill:
A Democratic aide said that the small business provision was drafted to exclude non-profits who receive Medicaid from being eligible for Small Business Administration assistance offered under the bill. That, according to the aide, would impact Planned Parenthood but also community health centers, rape crisis centers and disability service providers.
Planned Parenthood is identified as a nonprofit, not a small business.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Sunday she will be moving ahead with her own emergency relief package and ended hopes for an immediate vote in the Senate to further assistance for the nation in the midst of the crisis caused by the virus that originated in China.
Breitbart News reported:
Senate Republicans and the White House have insisted that they will continue to push for the $1.6 trillion economic relief package, which would include $350 billion in support for small businesses and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. The package would also include direct cash payments to individuals around $1,200 per individual, with additional funds going to families with children.
Politico also reported that Pelosi’s announcement is an indication she will not be simply taking up the Senate bill and moving it forward on a unanimous consent basis:
That also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts.
Fox News reported on the impasse:
Democrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers — saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient.
The Wall Street Journal‘s Kimberly Strassel also weighed in on the stalemate on Twitter:
1) The Senate bill is bipartisan; assembled with D input from Day One. Everyone understands need for liquidity, and biz $ that get out fast and stop more layoffs. Ds's also got plenty, from unemployment plus-ups to medical surge, to more gov $. They NOW claim not enough? — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) March 22, 2020
2) Pelosi's balk is naked attempt to cadge more last-minute money. She's playing politics in a crisis. Which is almost as bad as Elizabeth Warren suggesting this is a corporate ""slush fund."" Gov shuts down economy, and Warren blames business? Toxic. — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) March 22, 2020
Two weeks ago, it was discovered Pelosi attempted to ensure a Hyde Amendment loophole was included in an earlier coronavirus economic stimulus proposal. The Hyde Amendment is a longstanding provision applied to spending bills that states taxpayer monies will not be used to fund abortions.

This is Virginia we’re talking about. A southern state; the home of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington; a largely rural state that is unfortunately plagued with big blue population centers.
Here’s a rundown of how the bait-and-switch worked.
As my colleague AWR Hawkins reported, in order to distract from his blackface scandal, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam first proposed gun confiscation last January.
During the election that took place the following November, however, no Virginia Democrats ran on agreeing with this proposal.
But then, within days of grabbing hold of total control of all three legislative branches in Virginia, we learned that…
Virginia lawmakers are now considering a state law banning the ownership of certain semi-automatic guns deemed “assault firearms” and limiting the magazine capacity of other firearms in the state — and there are no clauses that would allow existing owners to continue possessing them. Virginia state Sen. Richard Saslaw introduced SB16, which would expand the definition of an “assault firearm” to cover many different semi-automatic rifles and pistols. The bill would call for the ban of such firearms, barring people from purchasing, possessing, selling or transferring those weapons. Among the changes in firearm definitions, the bill would expand the term “assault firearm” to include semi-automatic centerfire rifles and pistols with a fixed magazine capacity greater than 10 rounds. The bill would also ban semi-automatic rifles and pistols with detachable magazines that also have folding and telescoping stocks, barrel shrouds, and thumbhole grips and second hand grips.
Boom! Wham! Gun-grabbing!
Straight out of the gate, gun-grabbing.
And the only thing that stopped Democrats from confiscating guns, from making thousands of law-abiding American outlaws with the stroke of a pen, was an unexpected and unexpectedly belligerent pushback from rural counties in Virginia, over a hundred of them that promised to defy these extremist laws through sanctuary counties.
To date, some 118 Virginia counties have declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries. This all happened within weeks of the Democrat takeover and the confiscation threat. What this means is that in these particular countries, local law enforcement agree to not enforce anti-gun laws, especially dangerous radical ones like confiscation, bans, mandatory registration, and limiting the size of magazines.
It was only after this that Democrats finally backed down to what I call a “Confiscation-Lite” proposal where you can either agree to register what the government declares an “assault weapon” or you can hand it over.
One Virginia Democrat has gone so far as to seriously propose the state use the National Guard to enforce these extreme gun control laws in the counties that refuse. Can you imagine? Northam says he opposes that idea, but even if you take him at his word (and why would you?), he still wants you to register with the state. So now the state knows who owns the guns, and after Northam leaves office in 2021, what happens when Virginia gets a governor who is in favor of using the Guard?
You see how this works?
Let’s not forget this is the “you can keep your insurance and doctor” party.
Now let’s talk about Burisma Joe Biden.
Biden now claims he isn’t running on gun confiscation, just “Confiscation-Lite” through a national AR-15 registration and a ban. Even if you believe him (and I don’t) this is still a flip-flop, because Burisma Biden was originally in favor of confiscation. Here are Biden’s own words from a Democrat Primary debate in August: [emphasis added]
Folks, look, and I would buy back [assault] weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that’s a good expenditure of money.
When pressed on this in a subsequent interview, Biden refused to answer:
BIDEN: What I would do is — I would try to — I would institute a national buyback program and I would move it in the direction to making sure that that in fact is what we try to do, get them off the street. CNN: But that’s not confiscating… BIDEN: No, that’s not walking into their homes, knocking on their doors, going through their gun cabinet, et cetera. CNN: So people would be allowed to keep the weapons they already have? BIDEN: Right now, there’s no legal way that I’m aware that you could deny them the right to have purchased (ph) — legally purchase them.
Notice how Biden never answers the question. He doesn’t say he would never sign or pursue a confiscation law. He only says “Right now, there’s no legal way…” Obviously, the fake news gun-grabbers at CNN were not going to pin him down.
The FIRST thing Democrats in Virginia did after obtaining power was to pursue outright gun confiscation.
That is who these people really are, that is their true goal, and once we’re all registered through these “Confiscation-Lite” programs, like the one proposed by Biden, the Democrats’ stated goal of confiscating our guns will become much, much, much easier.

It is far from the first time that Trump has offered to intervene in a seemingly intractable international dispute.,https://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-offers-to-mediate-kashmir-conflict-between-india-and-pakistan/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,66.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Washington (AFP) – US President Donald Trump on Monday said he had been asked to mediate the decades-long Kashmir conflict by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and would be happy to help, but his claim was swiftly denied by New Delhi.
India and Pakistan have fought two of their three full-scale wars over the Himalayan former kingdom since gaining their independence from Britain in 1947.
Trump was hosting Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan at the White House on Monday, who was asked by a reporter whether the US could play a role in resolving the dispute, and replied: “Only the most powerful state headed by President Trump can bring the two countries together.”
Trump responded: “So I was with Prime Minister Modi two weeks ago and we talked about this subject and he actually said, ‘Would you like to be a mediator, or arbitrator?’
“I said ‘where?’ He said: ‘Kashmir, because this has been going on for many, many years.’”
“I was surprised at how long it’s been going on, I think they would like to see it resolved and I can help, I would love to be a mediator,” said Trump, who prides himself on being a dealmaker.
“Right now there’s just bombs all over the place. They say everywhere you go you have bombs and it’s a terrible situation… If I can do anything to help that, let me know.”
Trump’s offer would amount to a shift in long-standing US policy that the issue must be solved bilaterally.
And the claim that Modi had sought his intervention was flatly refuted by India’s foreign ministry, which took the unusual step of issuing a statement late into the night in response.
“No such request has been made by Prime Minister to the US President,” Raveesh Kumar, India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesman said.
“It has been India’s consistent position that all outstanding issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally.”
It is far from the first time that Trump has offered to intervene in a seemingly intractable international dispute.
On Friday, Trump said he remained ready to help South Korea and Japan solve their lingering dispute over World War II-era forced labor that has blighted their trade ties.
In 2017, he offered to mediate territorial disputes in the South China Sea between China, Vietnam and other Asia-Pacific countries — a proposal that did not move forward.
– Nuclear flashpoint –
India and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir, a part of which is also controlled by China, for decades.
In February, a suicide bombing claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group killed 41 Indian troops in Indian-controlled Kashmir, prompting tit-for-tat air strikes between the two countries.
But the crisis was averted after Pakistan returned an Indian pilot who was shot down and captured.
In early July, Pakistan’s military accused India of killing five soldiers during a blast along the de facto border.
And last month, India’s Central Reserve Police Force said militants attacked a patrol, killing three of the paramilitaries.
Some 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have died over the past 30 years in Indian-administered Kashmir, monitoring groups say.
The fighting is between Indian soldiers — who number around 500,000 on the ground — and rebels wanting either independence or union with Pakistan.",['intractable']
"But the president kept his word when it came to the Court. It’s still early in the Trump era, of course, and we really have no idea how the residual political effects of our acute partisan battles or investigations or ugly rhetoric or the often-incompetent presidency will manifest in the long term.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/06/27/was-gorsuch-worth-a-trump-presidency-its-starting-to-look-that-way/,federalist,trump-presidency,right,66.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A presidency is more than one man, and so far, the Constitution is winning.
It’s odd, isn’t it, that so many of the folks who warn us about the authoritarianism of the GOP also happen to support an array of policies that coerce Americans to do things they don’t want to?
Take, for example, the four reliably liberal Supreme Court justices, all of whom believe it’s OK to compel Americans to pay dues to political organizations they disagree with, to coerce them to say things they abhor, and to compel them to create things that undermine their principles.
For some, myself included, the prospects of a court run by people who ignore the Constitution was the best argument for Donald Trump in 2016. The question was, “What’s scarier, a Trump presidency or a progressive Supreme Court?” I imagine the answer is becoming a bit clearer for many conservatives.
In three cases this term — the rulings that stopped the Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission from destroying Jack Phillips’ business over a thought crime, California’s attempt to force people to support abortion, and public-sector unions from continuing their long-standing policy of forcing workers to fund their political activities — the court has handed the Constitution clear wins.
I mean, has there been a bigger win for small-government, real-life conservatives over the past few decades than the Janus v. AFSCME ruling? The decision not only fortifies the First Amendment by explicitly finding compelled speech unconstitutional, but also calls out the Left’s authoritarian political machinery, which has been holding many American communities, school systems, and workers hostage for decades.
“It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority. “Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.”
The Janus ruling also stipulates that employees must now affirmatively opt-in — rather than having to opt out — of unions before having to pay fees. The court understood that dollars are fungible, and every one of them should be considered a matter of speech.
Certainly, it would not have been the case had Hillary won. We know this by taking a peek at a counterhistory offered by reading the liberal dissents.
“The First Amendment,” writes Justice Elena Kagan, “was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance — including over the role of public-sector unions.” The idea that the court should decide who deserves First Amendment protections, or that those protections should be contingent on the vagaries of “democratic governance,” whatever that means, is as corrupt as any of the dumb things Trump has ever said about free expression. The Supreme Court is built to withstand the whims of democracy, of majoritarianism, not to surrender to them. (Then again, Kagan gives away her political game when she worries that “Public employee unions will lose a secure source of financial support.”)
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, accused the majority of weaponizing the First Amendment — an unconscionable position for a person tasked with “faithfully and impartially” discharging the duty to protect the inherent rights of all Americans. The dissenters have perverted the intent of the Founders. It’s none of Sotomayor’s business how we use free expression. It’s her business to protect it.
And in an environment where Americans are increasingly drifting apart ideologically, culturally, and politically on virtually every major issue, gridlock has become the de facto state of affairs in DC, and the court becomes even more important. Whatever Trump’s predilections or beliefs might be, to this point the First Amendment has been strengthened under this presidency.
Don’t get me wrong: Trump’s attacks on the press can be harmful and gratuitous (though, of course, not every tweet critical of CNN is an attack on the foundations of the First Amendment). Yet they are far less consequential than allowing SCOTUS to codify attacks on free expression.
Not that we should forget that we can thank Mitch McConnell for giving Trump the Neil Gorsuch seat. The much-disparaged Senate leader withstood immense political pressure and preposterous attacks when stopping President Obama from stacking the court.
But the president kept his word when it came to the Court. It’s still early in the Trump era, of course, and we really have no idea how the residual political effects of our acute partisan battles or investigations or ugly rhetoric or the often-incompetent presidency will manifest in the long term. Perhaps Trump’s unpopularity will make it harder for originalists to find their way to the Supreme Court in the future. Perhaps not. It’s also true that in no time in modern American history has a president’s disposition and rhetoric conflicted more dramatically with the outcomes of his administration. But that has been a net win for the Constitution.","['ugly', 'rhetoric', 'often-incompetent', 'presidency']"

For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks.
To the extent that they commented on coronavirus at all, it was only to tear up the president’s remarks or to call him a racist. They told the nation that he, not coronavirus, was a threat to the national security of the United States.
In the midst of that all-consuming trial, it is remarkable Trump was able to do anything else at all. But he did, and one of the things he did was impose the China travel ban, just one day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency, and the day before the first victim of the pandemic died outside China.
For his trouble, he was criticized by the World Health Organization and called “hysterical” by his future 2020 rival.
When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them.
Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner.

DeSantis was initially tentative to shut down outdoor recreational areas like beaches and was ridiculed by the media for his allegedly relaxed response.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/20/ron-desantis-spits-fire-at-mainstream-media-for-apocalyptic-reporting-on-floridas-coronavirus-response/,federalist,coronavirus,right,66.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"During a press conference with Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called out the mainstream media for their inaccurate reporting about COVID-19 deaths in his state. DeSantis was initially tentative to shut down outdoor recreational areas like beaches and was ridiculed by the media for his allegedly relaxed response.
The media was calling Florida “the next New York City,” claiming the epicenter of the coronavirus was moving to the sunshine state. As of today, Florida has a total of 2,052 COVID-19 deaths compared to New York’s 22,843 deaths. The two states are opposites in both death rates and gubernatorial responses.
When asked about the accuracy of Florida’s data, DeSantis called out the media for trying to insinuate the data was false in any manner.
“Our data is available, our data is transparent. In fact, Dr. [Deborah] Birx has talked multiple times about how Florida has the absolute best data. So, any insinuation otherwise is just typical, partisan narrative trying to be spun,” DeSantis told reporters. “You’ve got a lot of people in your profession who wax poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York.”
DeSantis recalled the mainstream media’s narrative claiming we all need to wait two weeks and then Florida will be like New York or Italy.
“Well, hell, we’re eight weeks away from that and it hasn’t happened,” DeSantis said. “I was the number one landing spot from tens of thousands of people leaving the number one hot zone in the world to come to my state.”
Good stuff from DeSantis here. pic.twitter.com/ESvo6Pb1uw — neontaster (@neontaster) May 20, 2020
DeSantis concluded by saying Florida has succeeded in tackling coronavirus and he’s frustrated the mainstream media treat him as the boogeyman.
“We’ve succeeded and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption. So, they’ve got to try and find a boogeyman,” DeSantis said.
In an interview with National Review’s Rich Lowry, DeSantis said he was surprised at how hostile the coverage was of his work in Florida. However, he noted that “none of these people knew anything about Florida at all,” so he didn’t care what they were saying.
For instance, the mainstream media made it conventional wisdom Florida would be hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic because of their roughly 350,000 residents in nursing care facilities across the state, but the state took practical measures to mitigate the spread of the virus for such facilities.
“We advised, before there was even mitigation, if you’re 65 and older, stay home as much as possible and avoid crowds. And that was just something that made sense,” DeSantis told National Review.
Meanwhile, New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an advisory for hospitals to discharge elderly patients with COVID-19 back to nursing homes. Nursing homes and long-term care facilities alike are struggling to protect their employees and residents from the coronavirus because they lack adequate protective equipment. Many facilities are also short on staff, which requires staff members to interact with more patients, both healthy and ill.
“An irony of the national coverage of the coronavirus crisis is that at the same time DeSantis was being made into a villain, New York governor Andrew Cuomo was being elevated as a hero, even though the DeSantis approach to nursing homes was obviously superior to that of Cuomo,” Lowry wrote on the poor coverage of DeSantis’ pragmatic work.
The media has a clear agenda in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic; champion the Democratic governors and slam the Republican governors. It doesn’t matter whether Republicans are doing well or whether Democrats are doing poorly. The goal of the media is to alter reality to make it fit their narrative.","['allegedly', 'ridiculed']"
But the British Government — and this one’s Conservative; imagine what a Labour one would be like! — is so wedded to green ideology and so nervous of the well-funded anti-fracking campaign industry that it has imposed such extreme precautionary principles on shale gas exploration that the fracking industry has effectively been strangled at birth with red tape.,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/17/britains-richest-businessman-does-a-john-galt/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,66.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Britain’s richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe (worth £21 billion) is leaving the United Kingdom and the European Union for tax exile in Monaco, depriving the Treasury of up to £4 billion in tax. This is more tax than the entire bottom 40 percent of the British population pay: that’s because none of them pays any tax at all.
To understand why Ratcliffe is leaving, you need only glance at the reaction on social media.
Some people hate him because he’s a Brexiteer:

Now put yourself in Ratcliffe’s shoes. You’re a self-made man who, through hard work and determination, has built one of Britain’s most successful businesses. (Ineos, Ratcliffe’s industrial and chemicals business, has a turnover of £45 billion and 18,500 employees.) And in return for the value you have created, the employment you have provided and the tax revenue you have generated, all you get is a bunch of chippy socialists and whiny Remoaners accusing you of being selfish, greedy, and unpatriotic.
Worse, though, from the perspective of a value-creator like Ratcliffe, is that both the British government and the EU have made it increasingly hard for him to do business. Ratcliffe’s business has been particularly hard-hit by the rising cost of energy, driven artificially high by the EU’s war on fossil fuels and embrace of costly, inefficient, unreliable renewables.
Ratcliffe set out the problem very clearly in an open letter he wrote last week to the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker:
Nobody but nobody in my business seriously invests in Europe. They haven’t for a generation. Everyone in my business does however invest in the USA, Middle East or China, or indeed, all three. The USA is in the middle of a $200 billion spending spree on 333 new chemical plants. China has spent that sum annually for many years, constructing its own chemical building blocks. Europe, not so long ago the world leader in chemicals, has seen its market share in the last decade alone collapse from 30% world market share to 15%. This is an industry that employs over 1 million people in high quality jobs in Europe and five times that in indirect jobs. Worldwide, chemicals is an immense industry, considerably bigger than the automotive sector with revenues approaching $4 trillion. Europe is no longer competitive. It has the worlds most expensive energy and labour laws that are uninviting for employers. Worst of all, it has green taxes that, at best, can be described as foolish as they are having the opposite effect to how they were intended.
This is one of the reasons why, in Britain, Ratcliffe has campaigned for an acceleration of the so-far all but non-existent fracking industry. Britain is sitting on trillions of tons of cubic feet of shale gas which, if exploited, would dramatically bring down the cost of energy. Indeed, it appears that Britain’s Bowland Shale is even more rich in gas than Texas:
Ineos, Britain’s biggest private company, claims drilling results from its field in Nottinghamshire suggest “U.S. levels” of shale gas under the soil. Tests found an average level of 60.7 standard cubic feet per tonne of gas – compared with an average 39 (scf) at a vast shale field in Texas. Ineos Shale chief operating officer Tom Pickering claimed it was the most significant drilling result so far in the short history of Britain’s shale industry. He told The Sun: “It’s obviously early days but these are the highest readings in the UK we have ever seen.” Geologists believe there could be 436 trillion cubic feet of gas in this part of the Bowland Basin. This test is consistent with that.
But the Government — and this one’s Conservative; imagine what a Labour one would be like! — is so wedded to green ideology and so nervous of the well-funded anti-fracking campaign industry that it has imposed such extreme precautionary principles on shale gas exploration that the fracking industry has effectively been strangled at birth with red tape.
So Ratcliffe has quit Britain not because he is instinctively unpatriotic or because he is greedy or selfish. He has quit because the EU and his country of birth has prevented him from doing the one thing that successful entrepreneurs care about above all else: business.
It’s quite possible too that lurking in the back of his mind is another clear and present danger: the increasingly likelihood that Theresa May is going to make such a hash of Brexit negotiations that Britain will remain effectively shackled to the European Union, and thus able to enjoy none of the commercial advantages that would have accrued had the United Kingdom become a freebooting global trading economy unburdened by EU tax and regulation.
And if that situation does occur, as well it might, it will increase the likelihood of an even more disastrous eventuality: a hard-left, confiscatory, high-tax, high-regulatory regime under Jeremy Corbyn.
Ratcliffe is leaving Britain, in other words, for the same reason all the wealth creators in Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged fly off to Galt’s Gulch.
Entrepreneurs are there to do business, create value and be rewarded for their efforts. It’s amazing, not to say astonishingly depressing, how many people there are in Britain right now – including many if not most politicians – who do not get this.
If I were Sir Jim Ratcliffe I wouldn’t be hanging around for Theresa May to screw up Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn to gorge on what’s left of the carcass. I’d be off like a shot, wouldn’t you?","['wedded', 'strangled', 'at', 'birth', 'to', 'green', 'ideology', 'precautionary']"

On March 17, 2020, Breitbart News reported Biden began receiving Secret Service protection. Not only does this mean he is surrounded by good guys 24 hours a day, but it also means he is protected with the very guns he is trying to take from average Americans.
For example, a source told Breitbart News the Secret Service will protect Biden with pistols, semiautomatic rifles–perhaps ARs and/or Sig Sauer MCX platform firearms–and that fully automatic firearms will most like be part of the equation too. The full-auto firearms often consist of submachine guns on a sling, which allows them to be carried out of sight under a jacket or coat.
Ironically, Biden is campaigning on banning the average man from owning rifles such as AR-15s, AK-47s, and Sig Sauer MCXs.
On August 6, 2019, Real Clear Politics posted video of CNN’s Anderson Cooper asking Biden, “So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they’re going to come for guns?”
Biden answered, “Bingo. You’re right, if you have an ‘assault weapon.’ The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.”
He added:
Look, the Second Amendment doesn’t say you can’t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can’t buy a bazooka. You can’t have a flame thrower. The guys who make these arguments are the people who say the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots; we need the protection against the government. We need an F-15 for that. We need something well beyond whether or not you’re going to have an “assault weapon.”
But Biden is protected by the very weapons he says “should be illegal, period.” Moreover, he was protected by them during his eight years as vice president to Barack Obama.
When is the last time Joe Biden went out in public without armed security? But yet he doesn’t want you to be able to defend yourself and your family. He’s an out of touch elitist hypocrite. 📸: @bennyjohnson pic.twitter.com/1tNVZp3Z3D — NRA (@NRA) May 4, 2020
Also, the Secret Service is using standard-sized magazines in their rifles, i.e., which means 30 rounds. But Biden is campaigning to ban average Americans from having “20, 30, 40, 50 clips in a weapon.”
The bottom line–Biden lives behind layers of safety bolstered by guns that he says “should be illegal, period.” He is enjoying the benefits of those guns while working hard to be sure average Americans cannot own them.

"The House Democrats’ 1,400-page coronavirus recovery bill threatens the livelihood of millions of American graduates and their families by expanding work visas for many of the roughly 1.5 million foreign college graduate contract workers who hold jobs in the United States.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/24/democrats-coronavirus-bill-expands-work-visas-for-foreign-college-graduates/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,67.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The House Democrats’ 1,400-page coronavirus recovery bill threatens the livelihood of millions of American graduates and their families by expanding work visas for many of the roughly 1.5 million foreign college graduate contract workers who hold jobs in the United States.
The summary of the draft bill says:
In recognition that several government offices have closed in response to the coronavirus that are responsible for reviewing and adjudicating work authorization requests or that impact American citizens, intending immigrants, and workers’ ability to live and work in the United States … a provision is included to automatically extend their current status or work authorization.
The unusual phrases — “intending immigrants, and workers’ ability” — covers the many foreign visa workers who are not legal immigrants but are merely contract workers holding jobs in the United States.
The Democrats’ bill is a massive giveaway to Silicon Valley, to tech donors, and to many Fortune 500 companies in the banking and insurance industries who have replaced their American graduates with blocs of imported Indian and Chinese workers.
Many investors, CEOs, and human resources managers prefer the visa workers over Americans, in part, because they can be quickly hired or fired via a network of Indian-run subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. The visa workers are also preferred because they are compliant and legally powerless — the visa workers cannot complain, organize, demand higher wages, or even argue with managers because they know they can be swiftly deported without any legal recourse. The massive supply of foreign workers also raises stock values by cutting white-collar salaries — although many of the visa workers are paid in line with Americans.
The visa worker population includes roughly 1.5 million college graduates, mostly from India, even though roughly 800,000 Americans graduate from college with skilled technical degrees each year.
Roughly 400,000 of these temporary workers can stay permanently in the United States because their employers have nominated them to eventually become legal residents.
But every year, hundreds of thousands of visa workers are forced to go home because their visas expire after a few months, a year, three years, or five years, even after also getting a one-year or a multi-year extension. Yet each year, the departing visa workers are replaced by another wave of arriving college graduate workers.
However, the Democrats’ offer of extended visas does not include any curbs on the arrival of new workers, for example, the annual arrival of 100,000 new H-1B graduate workers. So the bill’s extensions may add at least 100,000 foreign graduates to the labor market in 2020, just as millions of American graduates scramble to find new jobs.
The Department of Homeland Security told Breitbart News on March 19 that it has no plans to change the H-1B inflow in 2020.
Democrats' coronavirus recovery bill sells out America's college-graduate class by expanding job-competition from desperate foreign grads amid the economic crash.
IOW, it is a huge giveaway to Silicon Valley & business donors.'
'Foreign Graduates First'https://t.co/LR1qpNjLPH — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 23, 2020
Foreign college graduates allowed to work in the United States via a plethora of visa programs that are almost entirely ignored by the establishment press. They include the H-1B, L-1, Occupational Practical Training, Curricular Practical Training, TN, E-3, J-1, and B-1 programs, as well as a variety of science-related “post-docs” given to young scientists in university classrooms and laboratories.
The biggest program is the H-1B program. It keeps a population of roughly 900,000 H-1B workers in the United States, largely because the H-1B workers are allowed to stay six years, and many can stay long past their visa expiration once employers merely nominate them for green cards.
Similarly, more than 400,000 foreigners get work permits via the OPT and CPT programs by paying tuition fees to a wide variety or elite, average, or low-tier colleges. Most get one-year work permits, but 70,000 get three-year “STEM-OPT” work permits.
""With predictions of unemployment as high as 30%, it is unconscionable for House Democrats to use the Coronavirus response bill to actually harm American workers."" — Roy Beck, President, NumbersUSA — NumbersUSA (@NumbersUSA) March 24, 2020
The visa programs also include the H-2B program for the blue-collar workers who are imported by landscaping and resort employers, as well as the H-2A workers who are imported by farm companies. The J-1 program includes thousands of doctors — and at least 100,000 blue-collar seasonal workers.
The visa programs co-exist with a variety of work permits of recent blue-collar migrants, such as the migrants who crossed the border in 2019 and long-resident illegal aliens who ask for an “Adjustment of Status” to citizenship. This work permit category also includes the roughly 600,000 young illegal aliens in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals created by Obama in 2012. Very few of the DACA migrants hold university credentials. Each year, the federal government awards temporary “Employment Authorization Documents” to roughly two million foreigners.
The Democrats’ legislative language is not included in the summary of the 1,400-page bill, But a prior 1,119-page draft directs officials to simply extend existing one-year and multi-year visas that expire during the next 12 months.
At a time when millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Pelosi’s bill includes a measure to automatically extend nonimmigrant work visas. https://t.co/t1n9nWFC0W pic.twitter.com/MvXTKrBnIn — Ben Goldey (@BenGoldey) March 23, 2020
The language could actually increase the number of foreign workers who will compete for scarce jobs sought by Ameican graduates in the economic meltdown.
For example, the language seems to provide three-year extensions to one-third of the roughly 70,000 foreigners with “STEM-OPT” permits. That extension would likely increase the STEM-OPT workforce by 25 percent in 2021 and 2022 — even if no STEM-OPT permits are approved in 2020.
American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers, and White Collar Workers of America. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.
In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.
Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.

A specter is haunting the West; our elites see intolerant authoritarianism—along with a plethora of related “-phobias” and “-isms”—everywhere.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/08/nationalism-populism-and-saving-ourselves-from-a-dark-future/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,67.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"First Things editor R.R. Reno's book, 'Return of the Strong Gods,' persuasively argues that tolerance and liberalism are now at odds with our community bonds and spiritual convictions.
A specter is haunting the West; our elites see intolerant authoritarianism—along with a plethora of related “-phobias” and “-isms”—everywhere. Populist eruptions and governments from Brexit to Budapest to President Trump are perceived as confirmation of their fears, necessitating increasingly ferocious efforts to defend liberal democratic pluralism and its virtues of openness, tolerance, and inclusivity.
In his new book, Return of the Strong Gods: Nationalism, Populism, and the Future of the West, First Things editor R.R. Reno argues that these fears are mistaken. Rather than protecting us from intolerance and fascism, they are casting out the human loves that sustain cultures and nations against such darkness.
Unlike many writers sympathetic to nationalism and populism, Reno does not direct the blame for our present discontents upon anything so broad as liberalism, modernity, or the Reformation, or anyone so specific as John Locke or William of Ockham.
Rather, he addresses the postwar consensus that blamed the horrors of two World Wars on the “strong gods” that inspire strong loves and strong truth claims. The strong gods are not “golden idols or characters in ancient mythologies…They are whatever has the power to inspire love.” In public life, they are “the objects of our shared loves,” including not only the nation but also its symbols and heroes. And they have been banished as disturbers of the peace.
‘Negative Piety’
Reno presents the philosopher Karl Popper, author of The Open Society and Its Enemies, as a preeminent apostle of this “negative piety.” Popper argued that the Western philosophical tradition inaugurated by Plato was oppressive because it sought to know the truth, and “insofar as truth is known, it must be affirmed, which is to say obeyed. Therein lies the danger…Popper sees any form of transcendence as implicitly totalitarian.” In this analysis, we would be better off without capital-T Truth, for it divides us; it does not bring peace, but a sword.
Therefore, the postwar imperative of “never again!” necessitated disenchantment, openness, and weakness to dissolve the “strong beliefs and powerful loyalties thought to have fueled the conflicts that convulsed the twentieth century.” For instance, the project of the European Union is not just of easier trade and travel, but a deliberate dissolution of national identity and loyalty.
Reno demonstrates the development and eventual dominance of this viewpoint by examining a variety of figures, including George H. W. Bush, Friedrich Hayek, Albert Camus, and Jacques Derrida. Each contributed to the consensus against the strong gods and the trend, only accelerated by the end of the Cold War, toward greater openness: open minds, open economies, open borders, and open marriages.
Reno does overlook John Lennon, whose “Imagine” might be the purest popular expression of this: “Imagine there’s no countries/It isn’t hard to do/Nothing to kill or die for/And no religion, too.” A peaceful “brotherhood of man” will be achieved by weakening and dissolving strong loves and loyalties, when there are no differences worth killing or dying for.
Reservations about this program have withered among Western elites. Reno notes that “the center-left reconciled itself to openness in the economy, the center-right made its peace with ever-greater cultural openness.” The letters LGBT are now brought to you by Wall Street.
Of course, the demands of tolerance are not universal. The strong gods are still suppressed and exiled, and the heretic-hunting inquisitors of diversity have become more paranoid and vindictive in triumph. Pronouns are policed, nonconformist bakers are punished, and from the campus to HR, the bureaucracy of tolerance is a hybrid of the Kafkaesque and the Orwellian. New forms of intolerance and oppression are constantly discovered, and the exquisite sensibilities of the “woke” are able to detect racism, sexism, and so on down to 1 part per million.
Becoming Homeless
Advocates of the postwar consensus point to populist outbreaks as evidence that these repressive measures are necessary to protect the open society from its enemies. But the current populisms in the West are responses to the excess and failures of the postwar consensus, not to its absence. The immediate danger is not that of dark, strong gods, but of a vacuum. Our problems are not those of a closed society, but of one that is too open. We are not suffering from too much solidarity and loyalty, but dissolution.
This is exemplified by a leadership class that is disloyal to those it seeks to lead. On issues of economics and immigration, the rhetoric of openness has gone hand in hand with the ruthless exploitation of cheap labor and the disavowal of economic solidarity with fellow citizens. As Reno notes, “Our center-left leadership class will promise to subsidize working-class consumption, but it won’t reorient the global economy toward their employment.” Welfare, yes; jobs, no—just give the proles some cash so they can distract themselves with cheap consumer goods made in China. The costs of working-class decline are just one more thing for corporations to outsource.
Populist claims that the system is rigged resonate because there is truth in them. Elites are insulated from the worst effects of the cultural and economic dissolution they support. Reno observes that, “For all their talk of an open economy and open society, those in the upper echelons of our society work very hard to protect their children.” Everyone wants a secure future for their children, even if it requires ideological hypocrisy—just look at well-off white liberal parents in New York City and the schools they send their children to.
A broader sense of solidarity no longer informs our culture and economy. We are becoming homeless; a place to live is not the same as a place to belong, and the postwar consensus has deconstructed the sources of belonging. We were told that diversity and inclusion would provide “a home without walls” in which everyone felt welcomed and accepted, but this has not come to pass. Those subjected to these therapies of the open society still seek loyalty and solidarity, which often leads to nurturing grievances and embracing identity politics.
The postwar consensus is in crisis because it is unbalanced; the more dominant it becomes, the more destabilizing its neglect of basic human needs for belonging and solidarity becomes. Reno therefore declares that “We don’t need more diversity and innovation. We need a home. And for that, we will require the return of the strong gods.” The peace and prosperity the postwar consensus promised (and to some degree delivered) is not enough, for humans are not livestock.
The Anti-Human Consensus
We are not fulfilled by a boundless world of autonomous individuality and weak loves. We long to love and be loved. We long for a “we” to belong to and share our love with. In Reno’s words:
We desire to live shoulder to shoulder with our fellow man in the service of shared loves. So no, we are not safer with never-ending critique, the spontaneous order of the free market, technocratic management of utilities, and the other therapies of weakening. Disenchantment will not make our society more humane. When the open society becomes an enemy of shared loves, when critical intelligence wages total war against our anchoring convictions, our spiritual, cultural, and political consensus becomes anti-human.
Discontent is the inevitable result of a political and cultural consensus that is, “at root, fearful of love.” Men may do terrible things for strong loves and loyalties. The strong gods may demand dreadful sacrifices. But “the project of peace without love cannot go on much longer. Man was not created to be alone…We yearn to join ourselves to others, not only in the bond of matrimony, but in civic and religious bonds as well.” Thus, it is not a question of whether the strong gods will return, but what they will be.
The strong gods are coming back. They cannot be wished or sneered or critiqued away. Denouncing tribalism and complaining about ingratitude (as many advocates of the current consensus do) will not keep populism and other passions at bay. Limiting and restraining the dark potential of the strong gods of politics requires the stronger gods of family and faith.
G.K. Chesterton’s observation regarding the Roman Republic remains relevant, for “only men to whom the family is sacred will ever have a standard or status by which to criticize the state. They alone can appeal to something more holy than the gods of the city; the gods of the hearth.” We may also appeal to a God above the gods of the city. A man’s love for God above him, and for his family around him, provide strength that can defy the demands of the state.
As Reno puts it, “The perverse gods of blood, soil, and identity cannot be overcome with the open society therapies of weakening.” They can only be defeated by strong gods that ennoble and elevate. Therefore, he concludes that our task “is to restore public life in the West by developing a language of love and a vision of the ‘we’ that befits our dignity and appeals to our reason as well as to our hearts.”
Reno ends with this call to action, but he has not provided a definitive treatise. Rather, this slim volume is a self-conscious conscious reframing that surveys subjects from statesmen, theologians, and philosophers to architects, authors, and economists. Readers may quibble with parts of it (I would place much more emphasis on the continuity between liberal ideology and the postwar consensus), but the broad argument is persuasive and timely.
This book provides a disenchantment and deconstruction of the postwar consensus itself, revealing that it is not an eternal verity or the sole legitimate basis for culture and government, but a contingent response to the catastrophes of the last century. As such it was understandable, but mistaken. The goal of preventing fanaticism and authoritarianism was laudable, but the method of draining away particularity and its loyalties was not.
Endless openness is making us lonely, homeless, and anxious amidst our material plenitude, and has enervated the elevating loves that alone can resist the strong, dark gods of this world. The strong gods are returning. We will choose whom we serve by who and what we love.","['intolerant', 'authoritarianism', 'haunting']"
The transgender effort to suppress any recognition that men and women are different and complementary would not matter except for the movement’s political alliance with wealthy progressives and radical feminists who wish to destroy the political power of the male-and-female family.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/21/transgenderism-a-mans-penis-can-be-a-female-penis/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,67.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A man’s penis becomes a female penis once a man declares himself to be transgender, says Indya Moore, one of the players in a transgender-themed TV show on FX network.
If a woman has a penis, her penis is a biologically female penis. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 17, 2019
The declaration is built on the transgender claim that men who say they are women are actually women. But once the men are women, their bodies are women’s bodies. So men’s penises become female penises.
Moore extended the “female penis” claim by declaring the existence of ‘male vaginas,’ which are presumably carried by women who are living as men.
The “female penis” claim went viral because it spotlights the logic of the transgender ideology, which insists the Department of Justice must blur and forbid any legal or civic recognition of the biological distinctions between the two different and complementary male and female sexes.
This policy must be imposed to ensure that children and adults can easily discard their female or male sex by simply declaring they have an opposite-sex “gender,” or have a “gender identity” which is between male and female, say transgender activists.
A person’s “gender,” say activists, is their personal feeling about being female or male, or something in between. For example, Moore’s feelings are described as “binary,” or neither male nor female.
I am a biological non binary. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 20, 2019
Moore’s feelings-are-more-important-than-biology logic was explained by another transgender writer:
Moore took the often-heard rallying cry “trans women are women” one step further: She argued that if trans women are biological women, by definition, a trans woman’s penis is “a biologically female penis.” That’s a radical point missing in mainstream discussions on trans bodies, as trans women are often made to feel as if they should be ashamed of their genitals if they don’t have a vagina.
“Don’t use science to justify your bigotry,” Moore tweeted at critics of the “female penis” claim. “The world is way too weird for that s**t.”
The transgender effort to suppress any recognition that men and women are different and complementary would not matter except for the movement’s political alliance with wealthy progressives and radical feminists who wish to destroy the political power of the male-and-female family.
For example, editors at the New York Times invited a February 7 op-ed which smeared women who reject the political claim that gender is more important than biology. Author Sophie Lewis described the vast majority of women as “terfs”:
… the most vocal trans-exclusionary voices are, ostensibly, “feminist” ones, and anti-trans lobbying is a mainstream activity. Case in point: Ms. Parker told the podcast “Feminist Current” that she’d changed her thinking on trans women after spending time on Mumsnet, a site where parents exchange tips on toilet training and how to get their children to eat vegetables. If such a place sounds benign, consider the words of British writer Edie Miller: “Mumsnet is to British transphobia,” she wrote “what 4Chan is to American fascism.” The term coined to identify women like Ms. Parker and Dr. Long is TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In Britain, TERFs are a powerful force. If, in the United States, the mainstream media has been alarmingly ready to hear “both sides” on the question of trans people’s right to exist, in Britain, TERFs have effectively succeeded in framing the question of trans rights entirely around their own concerns: that is, how these rights for others could contribute to “female erasure.” Many prominent figures in British journalism and politics have been TERFs; British TV has made a sport of endlessly hosting their lurid rudeness and styling it as courage; British newspapers seemingly never tire of broadsides against the menace of “gender ideology.” (With time, the term TERF has become a catchall for all anti-trans feminists, radical or not.)
Lewis’ radical support for the transgender ideology is logical because she wants to minimize the role of male-and-female families. A review of her book, Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family, says:
Rather than making [birth] surrogacy illegal or allowing it to continue as is, Sophie Lewis argues we should be looking to radically transform it. Surrogates should be put front and center, and their rights to the babies they gestate should be expanded to acknowledge that they are more than mere vessels. In doing so we can break down our assumptions that children necessarily belong to those whose genetics they share. This might sound like a radical proposal but expanding our idea of who children belong to would be a good thing. Taking collective responsibility for children, rather than only caring for the ones we share DNA with, would radically transform notions of kinship. Adopting this expanded concept of surrogacy helps us to see that it always, as the saying goes, takes a village to raise a child.
But Lewis’ ‘Terf’ smear is also aimed at lesbians who wish to maintain a clear distinction between women and men. For example, former tennis star Martina Navratilova is being slammed by political activists for her growing opposition to transgenderism in sports. The Guardian reported February:
The former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has been criticised for “disturbing, upsetting, and deeply transphobic” comments after she argued that allowing transgender women [men] to compete in women’s sporting tournaments was “insane and cheating”. The tennis player and gay rights campaigner first drew criticism from equalities activists and trans athletes when she tweeted in December: “You can’t just proclaim yourself a female and be able to compete against women. There must be some standards, and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.” … “To put the argument at its most basic: a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to [fathering] babies if he so desires. “It’s insane and it’s cheating. I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair.”
The Guardian also saw fit to quote a man who is living as a woman describing Navratilova as beset by “transphobia,” as if the former tennis star is mentally ill.
Democrats argue that It is “cruel and unscientific” to define each person’s legal sex by biology. But if sex is not defined by biology/human nature, it will be redefined by politicians & the transgender lobby – regardless of damage to women, men & children https://t.co/4sjsAj9PrN — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 12, 2018
Navratilova’s criticism of the transgender ideology is increasingly echoed by women who say the ideology will erase society’s understanding of women — and of lesbians — as biologically, sexually, and socially very different from men.
This “biology matters” argument is also being made by Andrew Sullivan, a British-born gay advocate who led the political push to allow single-sex marriages. In a February article titled “The Nature of Sex,” Sullivan argues that a pending Democratic-drafted bill which provides legal recognition and rights to people who try to live as members of the opposite sex:
could put all single-sex institutions, events, or groups in legal jeopardy. It could deny lesbians their own unique safe space, free from any trace of men. The bill, in other words, “undermines the fundamental legal groundwork for recognizing and combating sex-based oppression and sex discrimination against women and girls.”
The transgender push to create legal rights for people living as members of the opposite sex would also threaten the legal rights won by gays and lesbians, Sullivan writes:
If you abandon biology in the matter of sex and gender altogether, you may help trans people live fuller, less conflicted lives; but you also undermine the very meaning of homosexuality. If you follow the current ideology of gender as entirely fluid, you actually subvert and undermine core arguments in defense of gay rights. “A gay man loves and desires other men, and a lesbian desires and loves other women,” explains Sky Gilbert, a drag queen. “This defines the existential state of being gay. If there is no such thing as ‘male’ or ‘female,’ the entire self-definition of gay identity, which we have spent generations seeking to validate and protect from bigots, collapses.” Contemporary transgender ideology is not a complement to gay rights; in some ways it is in active opposition to them.
And the truth is that many lesbians and gay men are quite attached to the concept of sex as a natural, biological, material thing. Yes, we are very well aware that sex can be expressed in many different ways. A drag queen and a rugby player are both biologically men, with different expressions of gender. Indeed, a drag queen can also be a rugby player and express his gender identity in a variety of ways, depending on time and place. But he is still a man. And gay men are defined by our attraction to our own biological sex. We are men and attracted to other men. If the concept of a man is deconstructed, so that someone without a penis is a man, then homosexuality itself is deconstructed. Transgender people pose no threat to us, and the vast majority of gay men and lesbians wholeheartedly support protections for transgender people. But transgenderist ideology — including postmodern conceptions of sex and gender — is indeed a threat to homosexuality, because it is a threat to biological sex as a concept.
A growing percentage of progressives oppose any recognition of the reality that men and women are different. But conservatives and feminists are championing the normal view that women and men are different, Sullivan wrote:Pol
It might be a sign of the end-times, or simply a function of our currently scrambled politics, but [in late January], four feminist activists — three from a self-described radical feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front — appeared on a panel at the Heritage Foundation. Together they argued that sex was fundamentally biological, and not socially constructed, and that there is a difference between women and trans women that needs to be respected. For this, they were given a rousing round of applause by the Trump supporters, religious-right members, natural law theorists, and conservative intellectuals who comprised much of the crowd. If you think I’ve just discovered an extremely potent strain of weed and am hallucinating, check out the video of the event.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say are entitled to women’s’ rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug-companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.","['destroy', 'political', 'radical', 'suppress']"
California has a ten-day waiting period on gun purchases yet that state also witnesses some of the most heinous public firearm-based attacks in the nation.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/19/michael-bloomberg-wants-48-hour-waiting-period-on-gun-purchases/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,68.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Democrat presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg wants to institute a 48-hour waiting period on gun purchases nationally.
Waiting periods have been adopted and repealed in various states for decades. For example, in states like Wisconsin, Democrats secured waiting periods in the mid-1970s by claiming the wait gave individuals time to cool off before taking possession of a gun. However, in 2015 the Cap Times reported Republicans’ fight to repeal the waiting period, arguing that it put law-abiding citizens at a disadvantage and made acquisition of a firearm for self-defense cumbersome.
California has a ten-day waiting period on gun purchases yet that state also witnesses some of the most heinous public firearm-based attacks in the nation.
Bloomberg is pushing a 48-hour waiting period for the U.S.
Moreover, he wants to mandate that “all gun owners … report to police if their firearms have been lost or stolen, within 3 days after they know or should know that their guns are missing.” He does not explain when a gun owner “should know” a firearm has been stolen, but three days is the reporting window gun owners will be expected to honor.
Bloomberg is pushing numerous gun controls in addition to waiting periods and mandates on the reporting of stolen guns, all of which make the lawful acquisition and use of firearms more difficult. At the same time, he lives his day-to-day life surrounded by good guys with guns.

"While Democrat presidential hopefuls aim to weaponize the tax cuts, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview in January that it is precisely what will assist Trump in making his case to the American people.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/20/amy-klobuchar-implies-trump-tax-cuts-didnt-really-help-middle-class/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,68.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Claim: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said during Wednesday evening’s Democrat debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, that President Trump’s tax cuts benefited the wealthy while implying it did not significantly help middle class Americans such as “the hard-working people in Nevada.”
Verdict: False. The GOP tax cuts helped Americans — and small businesses — across the board.
Klobuchar, who reportedly finished the night with the second-most speaking time, suggested during the debate that the tax cut legislation President Trump signed in 2017 mainly benefited his wealthy friends.
Klobuchar said:
And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and — let’s just talk about Donald Trump, because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy, and he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, “You just got a lot richer.” That is Exhibit A.
“And I can tell you, the hard-working people in Nevada were not in that room. So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone,” she said, attempting to distance herself from her more radical opponents.
However, the GOP tax cuts benefited small business and the middle class — not just the wealthy, as several Democrat candidates have suggested.
As Breitbart News has explicitly detailed, the majority of American middle class households, 82 percent, “received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260.” An even greater majority, 90 percent, have experienced an increase in take-home pay, and the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate also brought additional relief to many middle class Americans across the board.
Additionally, as Trump’s campaign pointed out, the tax cuts law also “doubled the child tax credit for parents while expanding its eligibility, putting more money in families’ pockets.”
Small businesses have also reaped great benefits. A Gallup poll released this month showed that the majority of small businesses, 69 percent, said they have benefited from the tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017. Americans for Tax Reform has documented hundreds of examples of businesses hiring more employees and issuing “pay raises, benefit increases, facility expansions, bonuses, and utility rate reductions where the GOP-enacted Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was cited as a key factor.”
While Democrat presidential hopefuls aim to weaponize the tax cuts, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview in January that it is precisely what will assist Trump in making his case to the American people.
As Breitbart News reported:
“We played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there,” she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced. “They said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it’s exactly what they’ve done,” she explained. “I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they’ve hired.” When asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders’ socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners. In one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees. That was a “direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” she said.
This is far from the first time Klobuchar has dismissed Trump’s tax cuts.
“My message is, ‘What’s been happening to you since this guy’s gotten in office?” Klobuchar said during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe last year. “Has that tax bill really helped you that much? No. Most of it went to help the wealthiest.”",['weaponize']

Al Green (D-TX) at a hearing on Wednesday perpetuated the hoax that President Trump called white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 “very fine people.”
“Were there any nice people among the folks who were screaming, “blood and soil,” “Jews will not replace us,’ — were there any nice people among them?” Green asked the white nationalism expert witnesses.
Christian Picciolini, founder of the Free Radicals Project and a former white nationalist, responded:
Sir, in my job, I have to believe there were nice people there because it is my job to try to pull them out. However, I think the statement of ‘very fine people’ was a very dangerous one, because it did equivocate two things that were not equal.
Green and Picciolini were referring to Trump’s frequently misconstrued remarks.
Trump delivered a speech after a rally in Charlottesville that began as a protest against removing a Confederate statue was marred by white supremacist violence.
In his speech, he referred to some of the non-violent protestors as “very fine people” but specifically condemned white supremacists and called them “criminals and thugs.” Trump said:
You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group – excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. … I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally. … Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.
However, Democrats, including some of the 2020 candidates, have continued to push a narrative that Trump called white supremacists “very fine people,” when he clearly did not.

U.S. manufacturers added 284,000 jobs in the last year, the most jobs added in the sector in a single year since 1997, as Breitbart News’s Economics Editor John Carney notes. In December 2018, alone, about 32,000 factory jobs were created.
American manufacturing is vital to the prosperity of communities, as every one manufacturing job supports about 3.6 American jobs in other sectors of industry.
The U.S. manufacturing jobs boom comes as free trade economists, billionaire donors, and establishment media pundits have routinely claimed that Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported steel and ten percent tariff on aluminum would cripple the American economy.
They said Trump's promise to bring back manufacturing jobs was a ""con,"" told us we were dupes for believing in a manufacturing revival. It just couldn't be done. It was impossible. But we're America. The impossible country. So we did it anyway.https://t.co/GnWXcDCq0P pic.twitter.com/Kp3TAGJ1dB — John Carney (@carney) January 4, 2019
In November 2018, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer claiming that Trump’s tariffs on imported products “endangers the jobs of millions of workers” in industries that have grown to rely on cheap foreign imports.
Months ago, the chairman of Cummins, a fortune 500 company, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times claiming that even short-term tariffs would cripple American industry.
“We see no upside in the implementation of tariffs,” Cummins Chairman Tom Linebarger wrote. “They are a tax, and the risky proposition of entering a trade war could slow down the economy. Even putting up short-term barriers with trading partners in China and Europe can cause long-term losses in market share, resulting in lost jobs in the United States.”
The free traders at the Tax Foundation wrote their research predicted that not only would Trump’s tariffs crush American industries, but they would also decrease Americans’ wages.
“These tariffs increase production costs for U.S. manufacturers, placing them at a competitive disadvantage, and will, on net, destroy more output, wages, and employment in the United States than they create,” Tax Foundation analysts wrote.
For U.S. wages, the opposite has panned out. In December, Americans’ wages grew 3.2 percent in December 2018 compared to last year.
The conservative Heritage Foundation called Trump’s tariffs “ineffective and dangerous,” elected Republicans have called the tariffs “dumb,” and pro-free trade Trade Partnership claimed that the tariffs would eliminate 146,000 American jobs, a claim that has yet to come to fruition.
Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul credited Trump’s tariffs for the economic boom in U.S. manufacturing, telling Breitbart News in a statement:
December was another great month for manufacturing. With 32,000 new jobs last month, tough action against trade cheats is helping create new jobs for American workers. [Emphasis added]
Paul said the new Democrat-Republican split Congress should now focus its attention on a massive infrastructure investment to continue driving American manufacturing and job creation.
“With more manufacturing jobs, communities throughout the country grow,” Paul said.
As Breitbart News has extensively reported, between 2001 and 2017, the U.S.-China trade deficit was responsible for the loss of 3.4 million American jobs. The vast majority of jobs lost from free trade with China have been in the U.S. manufacturing sector, making up 74.4 percent of all jobs lost and amounting to 2.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost. This total of jobs lost also includes the 1.3 million American jobs lost since 2008.",['cripple']
We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them—economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission.,https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/18/how-you-can-help-roll-back-the-coronavirus-police-state/,federalist,coronavirus,right,68.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit, but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood.
Last week, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy released a three-minute video in which he vigorously ranted against the ongoing lockdowns. Portnoy’s basic point was that the goalposts have shifted from “flatten the curve” to “find a cure.” He pointed out, in blunt and colorful language, that economic suicide in pursuit of the latter goal is insanity. His video went viral.
Portnoy is not a political figure. His anger over the economic crisis and sense that, having done our best to slow the spread, we have the right to take a risk to survive, resonates with a lot of normal people.
One of Portnoy’s repeated questions throughout the video was, “When did this happen?” When did we go from flattening the curve to tanking our economy, our livelihoods, and our futures? (Language warning in the video below.)
Last night on Tucker Carlson, Andrew Napolitano offered a related reflection when he described a free state as “one where the laws are written to uphold personal liberties,” while the definition of a police state is “one where the laws are written, legitimately or not, to uphold what the government wants.” He went on to note that there has been a transition in America that has not been gradual: “In a period of six weeks we have gone from a free state . . . to a police state.”
Alarming as it is, Napolitano is right. While COVID-19 is an obviously serious and frightening virus, our leaders (and many fellow Americans) seem oblivious to the destruction we are self-inflicting on our economy and on millions of American lives.
The bureaucrats and local would-be dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent. So how did we get here, and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive?
We got here because, as a nation, we agreed to the lockdowns in the first place. In late March and early April, as the virus was spreading in densely populated American cities and horror stories were pouring out of Lombardy, Italy, the mood among Americans shifted. Lockdowns started in coastal states where the threat felt most immediate, and swept the nation shortly thereafter.
The lockdowns happened because the national mood favored the lockdowns. Politicians knew they could call on their emergency powers and impose the restrictions because they would not meet resistance. Collectively, we consented.
Do not underestimate the power of a national mood. Wars have been won and lost based not on the military might of a nation so much as the will of its people to either prevail or to fold.
Nowhere is the spirit of a people more a force to be reckoned with than in America, where freedom and individual autonomy are part of our DNA. This invisible force is a very real influence in politics, and many constitutional abuses have never been attempted over the years, not because they were unconstitutional, but because politicians and leaders understood the actions would not be tolerated. In some sense, we are free because we choose to be free.
We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them—economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission. So how do we muscle out of our bind? How do we return from the police state we have become to the land of liberty that we enjoyed a mere three months ago?
One answer is certainly that we must enforce our constitutional rights by challenging the myriad overreaches in court. That is a critically important effort and just the type of pushback I have applauded for many weeks now. But, in tandem to that effort, and really prior to it, we have to shift the mood again.
Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit, but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood. When people honestly express to others their opposition to continued lockdowns, the sentiment spreads and the “mood” strengthens.
Portnoy’s video went viral not just because he is a popular guy; it went viral because it gave voice to people who weren’t sure their gut reactions were “acceptable” and to people who felt encouraged by seeing someone with whom they identified step up and voice opposition.
We all need to step up and speak out. Everyone has a zone of influence, large or small, and when you speak, you add to a critical growing momentum.
We lose freedom ultimately because we let bad people take it from us. Freedom is not taken by force only; it is often taken slowly and quietly, with our foolish consent that is given by silence.
America was not founded to be a police or nanny state. It flourished because it was the land of the free and the home of the brave. It grew to greatness because people were willing to take risks to survive and succeed.
The will of the American people is not just a political platitude, it is a tangible and powerful force for freedom when properly activated. If we want to roll back the abuses—if we want to break the police state and reclaim our livelihoods, futures, and political autonomy—we all have to affirmatively contribute to a new national mood.","['economic', 'suicide', 'petty', 'suffering', 'insanity', 'nanny', 'submission']"
"Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/29/white-pride-creepy-black-pride-isnt/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,68.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Is it wrong to take pride in being white? This is not meant as a trick question, but it might be a little tricky. Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white.
There’s a complication, though. If whites can’t take pride in our ethnicity, is it okay for blacks or Hispanics to have ethnic pride? Our society looks on that kind of boosterism with a much more tolerant eye. What’s the difference? Have we so succumbed to the siren song of privilege theory that white people are the only ones left who are not allowed to feel good about ourselves?
That Damned ‘Invisible Backpack’
As David Marcus explained in this insightful essay, privilege theory is indeed a real problem. It helped re-awaken tribal loyalties that would have been better left shifting in their shallow graves. Everyone is better off when whites don’t think too much about their whiteness. It should be normal without being normative, and regular without being right. It’s having a one-story house. It’s writing in black pen. It’s Times New Roman.
Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman. They poked and they prodded, and eventually got the resentful backlash they were provoking. Privilege theory has done real damage, and white liberals should be assessing their mistakes. Nevertheless, it’s hard to believe that privilege theory is the only culprit.
When higher allegiances break down, lower ones become more prominent. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, and that involves finding reasons to align yourself with this group of people, instead of that other one. Group allegiances are not necessarily an excuse for hatred or bigotry (although they can give rise to those evils). They’re about belonging somewhere, and having people you can turn to when the road gets rocky. People need that.
It’s no secret that Trumpism and the alt-right have found their strongest footholds in places where social and economic breakdown are the worst. Family structures break down, church communities dwindle, the economy sags, and ethno-nationalism becomes more appealing.
Proud to Be a (White) American?
Is Trumpism racist? It’s been a contentious question of late. While it’s perfectly evident that Trump does have racist supporters (which he is suspiciously reluctant to condemn), many contend that Trumpism is itself not racist, but merely a justified reaction to the Left’s racial patronage. All Trump’s supporters really want is a properly colorblind society.
It’s not a terribly convincing argument because, among other reasons, Trumpism so obviously represents a desperate cry for group recognition and a demand for group patronage. How has the market been good for us? Bring back our jobs. Even the “America first” motto is clearly focused on a particular vision of America that only a minority of its citizens seem to share.
We may be reaching the point where we need to define more carefully what “racism” really means. To that end, the rhetoric of the alt-right may perhaps be worth examining as an indicator of what some of our “white boosters” are thinking nowadays. There’s admittedly some distance between ordinary Trump supporters and alt-right quasi-intellectuals, but the latter have clearly attracted a non-trivial following in the Trump camp. Alt-rightism shouldn’t be lazily dismissed as a totally detached, insane fringe. It has hit a chord with many ordinary Americans, thriving on the mainstream’s predictable preference for shunning its arguments instead of answering them.
Many alt-right thinkers are willing to argue openly that race matters, that genetics play a non-trivial role in the progression of cultures, and that race is naturally a deep component of personal identity. These arguments can get a lot of oxygen in a world already obsessed with race. Liberals have had their identity politics parties and now alt-righters want theirs, which they expect will be truly amazing because they are in possession of western culture, the best cultural heritage there is.
Conquering Western Civilization
Hear them roar! Alt-righters love to talk about how smart and strong and savvy they are. (Fun game: count the number of times this article brags about those smarty-pants alt-righters and their incredible intellectual heft.) They usually get away with it because they surround themselves with amateurs, who are unprepared for their juvenile jibes. After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler.
Try again, Hayes. Don’t validate the white supremacist’s claim to own Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Boetheus, Bonaventure, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Milton, Da Vinci, Tolstoy, Columbus, Newton, our Founding Fathers and alright, yes, possibly Hitler. Instead, ask him to justify his emphasis on whiteness as a cornerstone of western thought.
Undoubtedly, white men feature prominently among the heroes and visionaries of the West, and it’s reasonable to conclude on those grounds that white men can’t just be natural degenerates, as some liberals seem to suppose. Still, the greatness of the Western tradition doesn’t lie in its whiteness and maleness. It lies in its breadth, adaptability, and universality.
Terence, great playwright of the Roman Republic, told us “I am a man; nothing human is alien from me.” St. Paul told us that in Christ, “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female.” The great thinkers of the high Middle Ages were intensely focused on the human condition, not the Italian or French or male condition. No student of the Western canon ever pauses in the middle of “City of God” to ask, “Wasn’t St. Monica born in Northern Africa? Why are we reading this Augustine clown?”
In short, the Western ethos at its best is profoundly un-tribal. To claim this rich tradition specifically for whites, therefore, is to muddy it and betray its core tenets. American whites can absolutely take pride in their Western heritage. They came from the old world and settled this immense, wild place, extending the great traditions of their forefathers to a whole new land. But if we’re going to take pride in our Western heritage, we should understand that legacy calls for transcending xenophobic ethno-nationalism. We shouldn’t need that, and we have something much better.
The downside of the glorious Western tradition, though, is that its perversion can be ugly, raising dreams of totalitarian domination. (Now a Hitler reference would be acceptable.) Especially here in America, a young nation founded by old-world immigrants with classically liberal commitments, there just isn’t a healthy or grounded way to take pride in whiteness per se.
Slouching Towards Bethlehem
Let’s return to the title question. Why is white pride creepy when black pride isn’t? Shouldn’t we have to choose between a universal ethic of colorblindness, and one that endorses ethnic tribalism at least to some degree?
It turns out that white pride really is categorically different. To understand why, though, we have to think carefully about traditions and their role in lives and cultures. Melanin levels are not in themselves a significant indicator of human character or worth, and whites are not morally inferior (or superior) to any other ethnic group. Nevertheless, cultures do matter, and it could be that “white culture” just isn’t a healthy or organic phenomenon in the way that black culture is or at least can be.
Ethnic pride really isn’t a necessary feature of a healthy psychology, but it can be acceptable when attached to a meaningful tradition that also imposes expectations and requirements. Most of us have probably known kids from Asian backgrounds whose elders are constantly reminding them that their behavior and work ethic will reflect back on their family and clan. That ethos definitely seems to contain an element of ethnic pride. However, it’s incorporated into a tradition and community ethos in such a way as to be a mostly positive influence.
Black pride is connected to a minority subculture that developed in response to intense historical oppression. For most of American history, the non-integration of blacks into mainstream culture was imposed from the outside, so taking offense over the existence of a distinct black subculture would hardly be reasonable. (Of course it doesn’t follow that this culture should be impervious to critique.) It’s an authentic tradition that incorporated an ethnic element for extremely understandable historical reasons. Something similar could be said of most Native American traditions.
Blacks and Native Americans, as the most obviously oppressed ethnic groups in our nation’s history, have also been the most averse to mainstream integration. Other ethnic groups tend to be absorbed more organically into mainstream American culture with the second, third, and fourth generations. They may retain a certain cultural distinctiveness in their names, diets, or cultural festivals, but insofar as they do stand apart, these groups generally adhere to traditions that are substantive enough to keep megalomaniacal urges in check. Ethnic pride isn’t just an entitlement; it’s also an expectation.
Will the Real Cuckservatives Please Stand Up?
White pride really doesn’t have an honorable tradition to call its own. Its claims on Western culture are tenuous, and none of the other reference points (segregation and skinheads) are particularly admirable. So it really does seem reasonable to say that whiteness, although in no way shameful, is not per se a healthy source of pride.
Viewing the matter in this light, it’s somewhat unsurprising that our alt-right partisans actually seem to pride themselves on being brainy rebels and devil-may-care pranksters. They’re not traditionalists in any normal sense, because they stand outside the circle of ordinary civil discourse, and even take joy in the fact. They’re what happens when traditionalism meets expressive individualism, in a world with too many resentful loners and not enough churches. They brilliantly combine the worst of cosmopolitanism (its rootlessness) with the worst of provincialism (its narrow-minded tribalism).
Just as much as the progressives they loathe, alt-righters are the bad fruit of a collapsing culture, taking pride in whiteness because they’re too alienated from more-substantive cultural institutions (family, church, community) to find a more fitting link to their Western forbears. Will the real cuckservatives please stand up? I don’t think it’s the Paul Ryans of the world who are disgracing the legacy of the West.
As every literate conservative has now realized, the collapse of Middle America is one of the great challenges that faces our society in the present moment. We need to rebuild our families and our cultural institutions so people of all backgrounds can find meaningful community and personal identity. White pride is a bad starting point, however. Let’s not sell our Western heritage for a mess of identity-politics pottage.",['creepy']

She said: “College is supposed to help people achieve their dreams. But more and more, paying for college actually pushes those dreams further and further out of reach. That is a betrayal of everything college is supposed to represent.”
Clinton Doesn’t Realize How Colleges Spend Money
Like many liberal policies, it sounds nice. Who wouldn’t want college to be more affordable? But a closer look proves it’s anything but sound. On Friday, via his CyberDust app, billionaire investor and Shark Tank superstar Mark Cuban tore her plan apart calling it “backwards” and offering his own solutions which are, unsurprisingly, free-market based.
Cuban said:
[Hillary’s plan] stands a better chance of increasing the amount of money students owe than decreasing it. How? Just as easy money led to the real estate bubble a few years ago, the easier it is to borrow money for college the easier it is for colleges to raise tuition. Tuition keeps going up because no matter how high they raise it, students can still borrow more to pay for it.
In fact, Clinton’s plan is so inept in its ability to understand how college funding even operates, and so atrociously far from providing any adequate solutions to a complex problem, that it sounds like she was channeling the Simpson’s: “If something’s hard to do, it’s just not worth doing.”
Cuban continued with Clinton’s imprudent plan:
It doesn’t require any change in how a school receiving funds operates. They can still waste money. A lot of it. Competition for new students is fierce. So schools spend billions on perks they think will attract students and donors. They build new buildings, gyms, food courts, dorms, anything that they think provides drive up curb appeal to prospective students. To manage all of the above they hire more and more expensive administrative positions. All of which do nothing to improve education. Instead they just provide justification to increase tuition.If you meet a rich person who gave money to build a new building at your Alma mater, don’t thank them. Explain that the maintenance of that structure and the people who manage it are going to increase tuition for future generations.
He makes an excellent point. The average liberal arts professor’s salary is $83,623. A 2011 Washington Monthly piece reported: “A comprehensive study published by the Delta Cost Project in 2010 reported that between 1998 and 2008, America’s private colleges increased spending on instruction by 22 percent while increasing spending on administration and staff support by 36 percent.”
But the average cost of a liberal arts education is about $26,000 annually, with elite colleges demanding something closer to $50,000 annually. So Clinton wants to make college affordable without looking at how poorly colleges are spending their money, and thereby hiking up costs for the student? That’s ludicrous.
A College Degree Isn’t For Everyone
Part of Clinton’s plan is to hold colleges accountable for students not paying back their loans. But Cuban points out a college degree simply isn’t for everyone. “Not everyone should be a STEM student or business major. Not every company wants to hire only STEM and business graduates. There is a market for smart people with different perspectives. College has gotten so expensive and the amount of debt on students so crushing that schools are already seeing a dramatic decline in liberal arts students and in the number of liberal arts majors offered.”
Instead of motivating kids to payback their loans, Clinton’s plan might actually lead to the decline in liberal arts enrollment, since, as Cuban writes: “the risk of the university being on the hook to repay those students loans as required by the Clinton plan would be much higher.” In essence, “The Clinton plan could push liberal arts colleges and programs to the point of extinction.”
Clinton Can’t Do Math
Finally, Clinton, in a show of ignorance about of the free market that seemed previously impossible, says students will never have to pay more than 10 percent of what they make and all the loans will be forgiven after 20 years.
Cuban rips this logic to shreds and applies the same principle to the real estate market. “You can buy any house you want and you will never have to pay more than 10 percent of your income and after 20 years the mortgage will be forgiven. If it’s under water before then, the person who sold you the house will pick up part of the cost.” Would you spend more on your next house?
Mrs. Clinton: Your plan is an epic failure.
Free Market Solutions Will Make Colleges More Affordable
What will make college affordable? Cuban has a few ideas. It will be interesting to see if any GOP candidates mirror these free market-based suggestions:
The problems with college is how colleges are run. It’s not like things can’t change. I work with Paul Quinn in Dallas, between work study and Pell Grants the net cost to students is close to zero. How did they change the game? They started using open source textbooks so kids didn’t pay outrageous prices for books. They run their school like a business. They innovate. They see their cost model as a competitive advantage and it is. They are the model for the future.
Cuban’s most valuable piece of advice to a candidate trying to figure out how to make college more affordable:
“I would like to see a limit on the amount of private loans a parent or relative can take out or co-sign per year per student. I’m open to anything that reduces the amount of cash available to students to pay for school. That won’t reduce the number of students who will go to college. It will reduce the amount of money they have to pay to go as colleges reduce tuitions to be more competitive.”
The Clinton plan won’t work because it’s a progressive, liberal, quasi-socialist plan applied to something that should operate like a business within a free market. When the market is allowed to operate freely and competitively, it always works fluidly. When a business operating within that structure competes and innovates, everyone utilizing that business–whether it’s a college or a coffee shop–wins.","['atrociously', 'inept', 'Simpsons']"
Rep. Steve King’s (R-Iowa) comments on race earlier this month elicited a warranted firestorm of indignation across American politics and media.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/29/saying-western-civilization-means-white-people-dumb-box-rocks/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,69.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"What made Jewish and Christian faiths different from other faiths of the ancient world was their rejection of racial tribalism in favor of universal truths.
Rep. Steve King’s (R-Iowa) comments on race earlier this month elicited a warranted firestorm of indignation across American politics and media. In an interview with The New York Times , King said: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King responded by claiming that his syntax was misrepresented and that he was defending “Western civilization” rather than white supremacy or white nationalism.
King’s defense understandably rang hollow, as he has a long history of making comments ranging from insensitive to downright unacceptable. From the Left, many have claimed that that the term Western civilization has always been used to justify white racial superiority. Yet for those of us who study history, though, it is abundantly clear that Western civilization, both as a concept and in practice, has never meant white civilization.
Indeed, when properly understood, it is the most universal human project in history. King fails to recognize this, but it’s worth exploring how early Judaism and Christianity rejected racial and cultural division.
Western Civilization’s Ancient Universalizing Tendencies
The universal nature of Western civilization is visible in the ancient writings of the first great monotheistic religion, Judaism. This may at first seem inherently contradictory—was not the Jewish faith known for its exclusivity and strict ethnic boundaries? Doesn’t the Hebrew Bible contain stories of the Jewish people massacring other people groups in the promised land, indeed, eradicating them?
Moreover, the Jewish god YHWH (or Yahweh) is strident and uncompromising in his demand that his covenant people not miscegenate with the local pagan peoples of the Levant. This, however, is a limited and incomplete interpretation of God’s intention for the Jewish people.
Yes, YHWH called the Jewish people to a strict monotheistic exclusivity, but this was by no means along racial or ethnic lines. Indeed, the Old Testament is littered with examples of non-Jewish individuals being blessed by God, and even welcomed into the covenant community.
An oft-overlooked story in the Torah is that of Miriam and Aaron’s criticism of Moses for marrying a Cushite woman, and their attempt to use this to undermine his authority (Numbers 12). The Cushites were an African people, meaning Moses’ wife was probably black, especially given how YHWH responds—he punishes Miriam by making her leprous. In other words, if Miriam is proud of her skin color, God will make her as white as possible!
God also spares the Gentile, meaning non-Jewish, harlot Rahab when Joshua attacks Jericho, and she becomes a member of the covenant people. She is even named as an ancestor of Jesus in Matthew’s gospel. Another messianic ancestor is Ruth, a Moabite woman who marries a Jewish man. The prophet Elijah in turn raises the son of a widow from Zarephath, a pagan Phoenician city.
On a more theological plane, YHWH’s covenant with the Jewish people was intended as a witness to the peoples of the earth, one that orients all races and ethnicities toward worship of the one, true God. This is in stark contrast to the deities of the ancient world, who were typically not universal, but wedded to particular places and particular peoples. YHWH promises Abraham that “all the nations of the earth” will be blessed by his descendants (Genesis 22:18).
The psalms pick up this theme: “All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him” (Psalm 22:27). We read of God’s “saving power among the nations” (Psalm 67:2), and that “all the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name” (Psalm 86:9). This theme is consistent across the prophets: Isaiah 52:10, Amos 9:12, Zechariah 8:22, Jeremiah 16:19, among others, all make reference to a universal salvation meant for all peoples.
A Truly ‘Catholic’ Christian Civilization
The promises of this salvation reach their fulfillment in the person and message of Christ, who himself preaches to and heals the Gentile peoples living among and nearby the Jews (Matthew 15, Luke 7). On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descends upon the small band of Christ’s followers and enables them to speak in many of the languages of the ancient world (Acts 2). Thus begins the expansion of the church and the Christian faith across the Roman Empire and beyond, including the conversion of an Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8), whom the Ethiopian Orthodox Church views as one of the founders of its unique brand of Christianity.
Among the great theological contributors of early church are many Africans, including Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, and, of course, Augustine. The last is widely recognized as one of the intellectual giants of the ancient world, and foundational to both Western theology and philosophy, especially in his “City of God,” which proposes a global spiritual society.
As Robert Louis Wilken expertly recounts in his “ The First Thousand Years ,” Christianity’s movements west pivoted the locus of the faith to Rome, but it also had deep roots across the east. In addition to North Africa and Ethiopia, Christian missionaries had success in the Middle East, Persia, India, and China. Archaeologists have discovered the remnants of Nestorian Christian communities in China, while the Western Church had periodic, limited contact with the Syro-Malabar Church of India throughout the ancient and medieval period, ties which were strengthened once Portuguese explorers arrived in the late fifteenth century.
Inasmuch as Christianity is a component of Western civilization, the latter is an inherently universal, and racially and ethnically diverse organism. Indeed, one of the most remarkable qualities of Christianity has always been its ability to borrow, re-fashion, and incorporate concepts and practices from various cultures into its own beliefs and praxis. One need only look at the etymology of concepts like liturgy and sacrament or the doctrine of the Trinity to see how much the faith is indebted to the Greeks and Romans, among other cultures.
Western Civilization In The Americas Was Never All-White
Even in an American context, the paradigm of Western civilization has been far more complex than something that can be reducible to a single race. Consider the role of the American Indian. Although the European settlers often had aggressive and violent interactions with the original inhabitants of North and South America, it is impossible to imagine an American identity apart from the contributions made by the native peoples.
These are visible in geographic place names (Alabama, Illinois), words in American language (both English and Spanish), cuisine (corn), sports (lacrosse), and literature and the arts. From James Fenimore Cooper’s “Last of the Mohicans” to practically every American Western movie ever made, the Native American experience, even when trivialized or poorly represented, is palpable as a reminder of their place in our historical cultural memory.
The role of African-Americans is perhaps even more central to the idea of an American identity as a subset of Western civilization. Much of the United States, both north and south, was built upon the backs of black slaves and freedmen, as was the Caribbean and large chunks of South America, including Brazil, where slavery wasn’t outlawed until 1888.
Moreover, it is simply impossible to imagine an American identity without the contributions of black writers, musicians, inventors, politicians, and athletes. An America without the blues or jazz would be an impoverished America, as would be an America without the eloquence of Frederick Douglass, profundity of Langston Hughes, or spiritual leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Surely all of these are an indelible part of Western civilization in an American context. The same can just as much be said for Asian-Americans, many of whose ancestors built the infrastructure of our nation and have added to it layers of cultural complexity across the same areas cited above.
What made the Jewish and Christian faiths so different from the other belief systems of the ancient world was their fundamental rejection of racial and ethnic tribalism in favor of universal truths and values. In this respect, they also joined with other early contributors to the idea of Western Civilization : ancient Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Plato proposed a universal logos or “rational structure” that encompassed the cosmos, while Roman statesman Cicero declared that “one eternal and unchanging law” can “bind together all races in every era.”
Early Christian writers in turn set the foundation for the possibility of a unified Western civilization between Jews, Greeks, and Romans. For example, St. Paul cites with approval the pagan Greek writers Epimenides and Aratus: “For in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children’” (Acts 17:28). St. John meanwhile borrows from Greek philosophy when he refers to Jesus as the divine logos (John 1).
There is no room for “blood and soil” in the Western tradition, at least not in the sense of racial or ethnic superiority. The West’s very nature, from its beginnings in Athens, Jerusalem, and Rome, was always oriented towards universal truths that transcend our ancient tendencies towards arrogant tribalism.
Of course, a significant part of Western civilization owes its creation and preservation to people who would probably identity as “white.” But insofar as we reduce Western civilization to something racial, we undermine its true intellectual and spiritual potency, something capable of appealing to all humans precisely because it reflects what is good, true, and beautiful across all people groups. To equate Western Civilization with something as pedestrian as “white civilization” is, in effect, to stop believing and participating in it altogether.","['warranted', 'firestorm', 'indignation']"
"The bureaucrats and local would-be dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent. So how did we get here, and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/18/how-you-can-help-roll-back-the-coronavirus-police-state/,federalist,coronavirus,right,69.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit, but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood.
Last week, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy released a three-minute video in which he vigorously ranted against the ongoing lockdowns. Portnoy’s basic point was that the goalposts have shifted from “flatten the curve” to “find a cure.” He pointed out, in blunt and colorful language, that economic suicide in pursuit of the latter goal is insanity. His video went viral.
Portnoy is not a political figure. His anger over the economic crisis and sense that, having done our best to slow the spread, we have the right to take a risk to survive, resonates with a lot of normal people.
One of Portnoy’s repeated questions throughout the video was, “When did this happen?” When did we go from flattening the curve to tanking our economy, our livelihoods, and our futures? (Language warning in the video below.)
Last night on Tucker Carlson, Andrew Napolitano offered a related reflection when he described a free state as “one where the laws are written to uphold personal liberties,” while the definition of a police state is “one where the laws are written, legitimately or not, to uphold what the government wants.” He went on to note that there has been a transition in America that has not been gradual: “In a period of six weeks we have gone from a free state . . . to a police state.”
Alarming as it is, Napolitano is right. While COVID-19 is an obviously serious and frightening virus, our leaders (and many fellow Americans) seem oblivious to the destruction we are self-inflicting on our economy and on millions of American lives.
The bureaucrats and local would-be dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent. So how did we get here, and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive?
We got here because, as a nation, we agreed to the lockdowns in the first place. In late March and early April, as the virus was spreading in densely populated American cities and horror stories were pouring out of Lombardy, Italy, the mood among Americans shifted. Lockdowns started in coastal states where the threat felt most immediate, and swept the nation shortly thereafter.
The lockdowns happened because the national mood favored the lockdowns. Politicians knew they could call on their emergency powers and impose the restrictions because they would not meet resistance. Collectively, we consented.
Do not underestimate the power of a national mood. Wars have been won and lost based not on the military might of a nation so much as the will of its people to either prevail or to fold.
Nowhere is the spirit of a people more a force to be reckoned with than in America, where freedom and individual autonomy are part of our DNA. This invisible force is a very real influence in politics, and many constitutional abuses have never been attempted over the years, not because they were unconstitutional, but because politicians and leaders understood the actions would not be tolerated. In some sense, we are free because we choose to be free.
We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them—economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission. So how do we muscle out of our bind? How do we return from the police state we have become to the land of liberty that we enjoyed a mere three months ago?
One answer is certainly that we must enforce our constitutional rights by challenging the myriad overreaches in court. That is a critically important effort and just the type of pushback I have applauded for many weeks now. But, in tandem to that effort, and really prior to it, we have to shift the mood again.
Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit, but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood. When people honestly express to others their opposition to continued lockdowns, the sentiment spreads and the “mood” strengthens.
Portnoy’s video went viral not just because he is a popular guy; it went viral because it gave voice to people who weren’t sure their gut reactions were “acceptable” and to people who felt encouraged by seeing someone with whom they identified step up and voice opposition.
We all need to step up and speak out. Everyone has a zone of influence, large or small, and when you speak, you add to a critical growing momentum.
We lose freedom ultimately because we let bad people take it from us. Freedom is not taken by force only; it is often taken slowly and quietly, with our foolish consent that is given by silence.
America was not founded to be a police or nanny state. It flourished because it was the land of the free and the home of the brave. It grew to greatness because people were willing to take risks to survive and succeed.
The will of the American people is not just a political platitude, it is a tangible and powerful force for freedom when properly activated. If we want to roll back the abuses—if we want to break the police state and reclaim our livelihoods, futures, and political autonomy—we all have to affirmatively contribute to a new national mood.","['would-be', 'dictators', 'concocting']"

Warren failed to take a single state on Super Tuesday, including her own. She placed third in Massachusetts, behind Joe Biden (D), who won the Bay State, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who came in second place. That loss alone was enough to inspire “Bernie Bros” to air out their grievances against Warren on social media.
Many of them believe Sanders could have pocketed more victories had Warren dropped out of the race and encouraged the progressive movement to coalesce around Vermont’s socialist senator. Warren supporters tend to disagree and are chalking up her losses, and general critiques of the candidate, to sexism.

Robert Menendez (D-NJ) took aim at President Donald Trump Chief White House Strategist Stephen K. Bannon on Tuesday, falsely claiming that “white nationalist dog whistles” were being “blown by Steve Bannon in the West Wing.”
“Whether it is the delegitimization of Israel by the United Nations, the intimidation, and isolation promoted by BDS, or the white nationalist dog whistles blown by Steve Bannon in the West Wing, it is up to all of us to stand up, to stand together and speak out against antisemitism in all of its forms,” Menendez said at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Conference (AIPAC) Tuesday morning. “And that includes raising our voices together in rejecting antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia.”
Bannon, who previously served as Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, has denied the false claims spewed against him mostly by those on the left. “I’m not a white nationalist, I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist,” Bannon told Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter last November. He similarly told Kimberly A. Strassel of the Wall Street Journal: “I’ve never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.”
In that same article, he made it clear that both he and Breitbart News had “zero tolerance” for “racial and anti-Semitic” elements that are found in the alt-right movement.
Menenedez, who was indicted by the Obama administration on corruption and bribery charges after he was critical of the Iran nuclear deal, delivered the above remarks while making at speech against the antisemitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement which targets the Jewish State Israel. At one point during his talk, he noted, “We must stand together to ensure that the letters BDS are seen for what they are: Bias Directed Solely at one people and one country by those who should know better.”
However, this is not the senator’s first time criticizing Bannon based off of misleading reports in the media. Following Bannon’s appointment to Trump’s team last November, Menendez said on Facebook that his constituents are upset and “frightened that someone who has promoted hateful, bigoted rhetoric and radical ideas through his website has been elevated to such a powerful role inside the White House. Hate has no place in our public discourse, let alone in the people’s house.”
Bannon, and several others in Trump’s administration — including the president — have also been falsely labeled as antisemitic. Last December, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote, “Tell me how a man who publicly fights BDS, fights Iran, and opens a bureau in Jerusalem to support Israel is a Jew-hater? Tell me how a man who appoints some of the proudest Jews I know – like Joel Pollak – to the most senior positions at Breitbart is an enemy of our people?”

Bernie Sanders says he wants to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion over a decade to guarantee all Americans – regardless of income – safe and affordable housing.
In formally unveiling his “Housing for All “ plan on Wednesday, the progressive senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight bid for the White House said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities.
SANDERS STAFF SHAKEUP IN CRUCIAL FIRST-PRIMARY STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
“There is virtually no place in America where a full-time minimum-wage worker can afford a decent two-bedroom apartment,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""At a time when half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, this is unacceptable.”
He emphasized that “for too long the federal government has ignored the extraordinary housing crisis in our country. That will end when I am president. My administration will be looking out for working families and tenants, not the billionaires who control Wall Street.”
Sanders says he’ll fully pay for the plan by establishing a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of one percent of Americans. Sanders touts that ""99.9 percent of Americans will not see their taxes go up by one nickel” as a result of his housing plan.
It's the latest in a series of expensive proposals that Democrats say would be funded through higher taxes for the wealthy and other measures but have stirred debate in the presidential primary. Other such proposals include “Medicare-for-all,” the “Green New Deal,” free college tuition and medical debt cancellation.
“Sanders’ answer is always a massive spending program that will raise taxes on the middle class and increase government control over the lives of millions of Americans,” Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest said Wednesday.
A spokesman for President Trump's re-election campaign, Daniel Bucheli, called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp.""
In teasing his proposal during a speech Saturday in Las Vegas, the senator acknowledged that the $2.5 trillion price tag was “expensive.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the other top-tier progressive candidate in the record-setting field in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, has also proposed upping taxes on the ultra-wealthy
Among other things, Sanders’ proposal calls for building nearly 10 million homes through the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund, social housing, Community Land Trusts and other housing programs. He would also fully fund the Section 8 rental assistance program, enact a cap on annual rent increases at no more than 3 percent or one and a half times the Consumer Price Index – which ever is higher. And he would establish anti-discrimination protections for those receiving assistance against their landlords.
Sanders says through his plan, he’ll rehabilitate and preserve 7.4 million housing units “to eliminate the affordable housing gap” and build 2 million mixed-income social housing units.
The senator also took aim at President Trump, arguing that “instead of expanding federal housing programs, Trump wants to cut them by $9.6 billion, or 18 percent.”
“Instead of working to substantially reduce the outrageously high price of housing, Trump has proposed tripling what some of the poorest senior citizens and people with disabilities in America are paying for rent today,” he added.
Sanders also criticized the Republican president for proposing to eliminate the National Housing Trust fund.",['whopping']

Indeed, NeverTrump joined the media and Democrats in hyping the Russia conspiracy theory, and continues to mock those who dare to support the president.
The self-flattering conceit that sustains NeverTrump’s criticism is that Trump supporters are participating in a cult of personality. Never mind the fact that some of Trump’s strongest supporters have had no problem whatsoever in criticizing him for substantive reasons — as in the backlash against his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. NeverTrumpers still believe themselves to be the unique guardians of conservative orthodoxy and honest punditry.
They find a welcome audience in the mainstream media, which has always been willing to give a platform to those conservatives willing to bash other conservatives. (They deny that this is the game they are playing, because they maintain that Trump is not a real conservative, though he has governed as the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan.) They say they praise Trump when he deserves it — though they clearly savor the criticism more.
During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge. NeverTrumpers imagined they would be the last conservatives standing atop the rubble of the movement, able to set the agenda and the boundaries. After the election, most ignored calls for reconciliation.
Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.
The path ahead is a conservative primary challenge to Trump in 2020, and the foundations are being laid now.
For such a challenge to be successful, NeverTrump would have to coalesce around only one candidate — and not to persist, as it did throughout the 2016 primary, with a divided field of contenders. Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters.
The case NeverTrump and its candidate will have to make is that while they are grateful (ahem) for Trump’s success in defeating Hillary Clinton, most of his other achievements for the cause could have been done by any Republican president, and few other Republicans would come with Trump’s disadvantages. They have to hope that Democrats continue to flounder, so that a primary challenge would not seem a threat to the GOP’s 2020 prospects as a whole.
The biggest problem for NeverTrump, however, is the pitiful performance of the Republican Congress, which has been unable to act on its core priorities, and reinforces the notion that only Trump is strong enough to lead the party.
Nevertheless, NeverTrump sees in the 2020 race a reason to persist. It will continue to cast its fight as a principled one. Much of it, however, is about power and revenge. Apparently, NeverTrump cannot forgive Trump for winning.

"Banks lamented that China has now become a partisan issue simply because Trump has blamed China for trying to hide the discovery of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, and allowing it to spread to the rest of the world.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/04/02/rep-jim-banks-saw-coronavirus-threat-coming-as-democrats-pushed-impeachment/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,70.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"As his House Democrat colleagues were arguing to the Senate why President Trump should be impeached, Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) was watching with alarm tweets coming in from overseas about the coronavirus.
On January 31, in the midst of the impeachment trial, Banks compared the spread of the coronavirus to the Spanish flu.
Banks tweeted: “#Coronavirus is spreading as quickly as Spanish flu, which infected ~500 Million. And the #CCP is likely under-reporting cases. W/out reliable info, a pro-active response is needed. Quarantine is a good 1st step, @HHSGov.”
But most of his colleagues in the House and Senate were focused on impeachment. It was not even until ten days later — February 10 — that House impeachment manager and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) convened the committee’s first briefing on the coronavirus.
Banks said he had an idea that something was really wrong beginning in late December.
He was already tuned into threats from China as a member of the House Armed Services Committee and co-chair of its Future of Defense Task Force. He has also spent the last several years focused on the threat from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei and Chinese espionage on college campuses via their Confucius Institutes.
But he said he also follows a lot of anti-Chinese Communist Party figures on Twitter from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China.
“So it was really in late December, early January, I started seeing a lot of Twitter activity by some of the sources that we follow about doctors being jailed for speaking out about the coronavirus threat, about journalists in China also being jailed, punished or disappearing altogether,” he told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview.
“Then following that activity led us in those early days to determine that this is a serious threat that America should take more seriously than what we were at the moment,” he said.
Schiff announced on Wednesday he would launch an investigation into “what went wrong” with the U.S. response.
Banks believes one problem was that Congress was focused entirely on impeachment as the coronavirus spread to the U.S.
The day House Democrats voted to pass articles of impeachment against Trump was the same day the first person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the U.S. arrived in the country — February 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) celebrated the vote with commemorative pens and urged Americans to tune in to a live feed of House impeachment managers bringing over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Banks told Breitbart:
When I initially tweeted about what we call the coronavirus or COVID-19, Congress was entirely focused on impeachment and the day that I tweeted, I think it was January 31st, likening this to the Spanish flu, that was the day that the Senate was voting on whether or not to have witnesses in the impeachment hearings. A week or two later, when the president was in the heat of the Senate and the heat of the impeachment trial — that was the focus of almost everyone on Capitol Hill, which now in hindsight, we recognize that what we should have been focused on was this.
He said Congress was focused on impeachment “for the better part of six months” leading up to the president’s acquittal.
“That took the focus away from everything else that mattered, from our nation’s fiscal health, our nation’s economic health, to our national security interest, and in this case, it prevented us from addressing what will go down in history as one of the largest pandemics and national crises that we’ve ever had in the United States of America,” he added.
Banks lamented that China has now become a partisan issue simply because Trump has blamed China for trying to hide the discovery of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, and allowing it to spread to the rest of the world.
He said Democrats are not interested in holding China accountable, as it would put them on the same side as the president.
Banks experienced this personally when he introduced a bill condemning China’s early mishandling of the coronavirus and Democrat colleague Rep. Seth Moulton (MA) was forced by fellow Democrats to withdraw his support for the bill.
Democrats claimed the bill could incite racism towards Asian-Americans.
“What’s become painfully clear to me is that once again House Democrat leadership is far more interested in attacking President Trump than they are in addressing the real threat at hand,” Banks said.
“I’m old enough to remember when Nancy Pelosi was a China hawk, but today she’s no longer that,” he said. “Today…she’s far more interested in attacking President Donald Trump and playing footsie with China than holding China accountable for what they’re putting our country through at this moment.”
Banks’ bill also condemns China for its human rights abuses and treatment of the Uyghur Muslims who have been placed in internment camps. He said it now has close to 50 cosponsors — none of them Democrats.
Meanwhile, 131 Democrats have backed a bill by Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) that condemns “all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID–19.”
“Democrats are far more interested in throwing around dangerous rhetoric about it being racist to tackle the China threat and far more interested in attacking the president than they are confronting China,” Banks said.
“I don’t know how any member of the House Armed Services Committee sits through an open or classified hearing and could ever walk away and not recognize that China is the greatest existential threat that America faces today and for the generation to come,” he added.
Banks said his constituents — Americans from the Rust Belt who understand the China threat economically — are demanding that he do everything he can to hold China accountable.
He said there is plenty of work ahead. For example, the U.S. should disentangle its supply chain — especially its medical supply chain — from China. Congress could also restrict the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest health care network in the world, from purchasing its medical equipment from China.
He said the president should find ways to repatriate the cost of coronavirus by forcing China to forgive large amounts of U.S. national debt or by instituting tariffs.
“China should shoulder the blame both morally and fiscally for the fiscal cost of the coronavirus in the United States of America,” he said. “We could use funding from tariffs to create some kind of a coronavirus victim relief fund.”
However, he said, so far Pelosi had refused to allow such legislation to be considered.
“They don’t want to address this issue because it confirms that President Trump has been right all along. President Trump is the toughest president in my lifetime on China, who [has] refused to take the failed path of all the presidents before him in seeking to appease China,” he said.
“It’s sad that this is becoming a partisan issue. Addressing the China threat shouldn’t be a partisan issue,” he said.

For example, the Tallahassee Democrat reports that Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Georgia) is bringing Jeff Brinkley, father of Maura Brinkley. Maura was killed in the November 2, 2018, Hot Yoga shooting.
Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) will be bringing Parkland high shooting survivor Cameron Kasky:
After 6 yrs of working in Congress to end gun violence, I was losing faith. Moments of silence were never followed by action. But something changed after the Parkland tragedy. The surviving students used their voices to inspire change. That’s why my #SOTU guest is @cameron_kasky — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) February 1, 2019
The irony of these two particular invites–Brinkley and Kasky–is that they tell of story of gun control’s failure in Florida, rather than gun control’s success.
Following the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting lawmakers were pressured to pass a red flag law–allowing gun confiscation–extend waiting periods, and raise the minimum purchase age for long guns, among other things. Gov. Rick Scott (R) signed the gun controls into law on March 9, 2018.
All of Florida’s gun controls–old and new–failed to stop the Hot Yoga attack, which was carried out by a man who legally owned his 9mm handgun. This was the second high profile failure of Florida’s red flag law. The first was the August 26, 2018, attack at Jacksonville Landing.
But Rep. Swalwell is praising the post-Parkland change that resulted in more gun control.

"Well-intentioned politicians might want to provide a solution for student loans, but millennials won’t start making smart decisions unless they have to foot the bill for their own education. Unfortunately, no bailout or special program can save students suffering from a lack of responsibility.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/19/student-debt-crisis-students-fault-shouldnt-get-bailout/,federalist,student-debt,right,70.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"When President Trump rolled out his recent budget proposal, it made some cuts that were always going to cause controversy. For one thing, his plan would slash subsidized student loan repayment plans, and let the government crack down on missed payments. To left-wing politicians who think the state should hand out more subsidies, this might as well have been Armageddon.
Yet while 45 million Americans are on the hook for more than $1.4 trillion in student debt, Americans should realize that millennials don’t need a government bailout or intervention. The student debt crisis isn’t as bad as it seems, and it’s a “crisis” of our own making.
Choices Have Consequences
The average college graduate leaves school with around $31,000 in debt, which certainly sounds like a lot, but that’s just a monthly payment of approximately $300. So why are students really struggling to repay their loans?
Much of it comes down to choice. If you choose to study business, economics, engineering, computer science, or anything practical, you could see a starting salary of anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000. For people who make this much, it’s not very difficult to pay a few hundred dollars per month for student loans. With unemployment at its lowest levels in years, the labor market is tight enough that a new graduate with a useful degree shouldn’t have any trouble getting started in the workforce.
But if you major in philosophy or gender studies, you might struggle to find any job in your field, let alone a well-paying one. According to The Atlantic, “Underemployment afflicts more than 50 percent of majors in the performing arts, anthropology, art history, history, communications, political science, sociology, philosophy, psychology, and international affairs.”
Not everyone can be an engineer or a doctor, but anyone can find an area where his interests intersect with actual job prospects. Students can also double major, and gain practical experience in one field while exploring another. So if you decided a career in art history was worth the price, it shouldn’t be the government’s job to pay the bill for your student loans––even if it’s not your fault that the cost of college has exploded in recent years.
You Don’t Accidentally Rack Up Six Figures in Debt
Part of the reason the reaction to student loans has been so extreme is because horror stories once viral now seem normal, and most people know graduates with $100,000 or even more than $200,000 in debt. If bureaucrats weren’t wasting taxpayer dollars, and state governments weren’t pulling back their financial support for higher education, maybe these students wouldn’t be in that situation.
Still, there are only a few ways to acquire hundreds of thousands in debt. Maybe you went to an expensive private college for four years, or got a graduate degree. If you chose a lavish, $60,000 per-year private school like Trinity or Fordham, that’s your own fault. Average cost of attendance at a four-year public school is around $20,000 (and that’s before financial aid or scholarships, which many students receive)––so if you’re buried in hundreds of thousands in debt, it’s because you made a decision you couldn’t afford.
For graduate students, it’s understandable that they’ve taken on so much in loans, as some advanced degrees can take seven or even eight years to complete. But they don’t need the government’s help to pay back their debt. The expected lifetime earnings for someone with a doctoral degree totals $3.3 million.
I’d Rather See a Concert than Pay My Loan
Many millennials aren’t paying back their student loans. But is that because they truly can’t? In 2016, 1.1 million graduates defaulted on their loans for the first time, yet their ability to make payments might not be the problem.
When a survey asked recent graduates what they would sacrifice to pay off their debt, “less than half were willing to do without concert tickets, lattes, food delivery, alcohol purchases or travel.” Around 15 percent didn’t even know how much money they owed. Nearly a third of students polled planned to use some of their student loan money to pay for their spring break trips, while 23 percent said they had used loans to purchase alcohol, and 6 percent said they used the money for drugs. We have a student debt crisis, but the real issue isn’t the number on the balance sheet. It’s a generation trapped in perpetual adolescence, confused about how to get out.
Years ago, people in their early twenties used to have mortgages, marriages, and children to take care of. Things have changed in ways beyond my generation’s control, but it’s still embarrassing that some now think that a $300 monthly payment constitutes a crisis, and that the government needs to save them. Maybe millennials need to realize that they can’t afford to live in expensive cities, and that paying one’s debts should come before planning your next vacation.
In his recent book, “The Vanishing American Adult,” Sen. Ben Sasse wrote that “Letting the next generation believe someone else will solve their problems imperils not only them but our whole society.” Well-intentioned politicians might want to provide a solution for student loans, but millennials won’t start making smart decisions unless they have to foot the bill for their own education. Unfortunately, no bailout or special program can save students suffering from a lack of responsibility.","['Well-intentioned', 'suffering', 'lack', 'of', 'responsibility', 'smart']"
The Senate Republican leader said that some Democrats told him in private they were embarrassed by Pelosi and Schumer’s political stunt.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/mitch-mcconnell-democrats-embarrassed-pelosi-schumer-blocked-coronavirus-relief-bill/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,70.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor on Monday that some Democrats are “embarrassed” that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blocked the bipartisan coronavirus relief package.
McConnell spoke on the Senate floor after Democrats blocked a bipartisan package that would alleviate the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. Four swing state Senate Democrats — Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Doug Jones (D-AL), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Gary Peters (D-MI) — voted against the bipartisan package to provide Americans relief.
The Senate Republican leader said that some Democrats told him in private they were embarrassed by Pelosi and Schumer’s political stunt.
McConnell said Democrats “ought to be embarrassed.” He added, “In fact, I’ve heard from some who are embarrassed, talking like this is not some juicy political opportunity.”
“This is a national emergency,” he added.
McConnell asked rhetorically, “Why are Democrats filibustering the bipartisan bill they helped write?”
The Senate majority leader chastised Democrats for pushing their “wish list” of special interest provisions to be included in the bill.
McConnell explained:
Tax credits for solar energy and wind energy, provisions for employees to give special and new treatment to big labor? And listen to this: new emissions standards for the airlines. Are you kidding me? This is the moment to debate new regulations that have nothing whatsoever to do with this crisis? I’d like to see Democrats tell New York City doctors and nurses, who are literally overrun, that they are filibustering hospital funding for masks because they want to argue with the airlines over their carbon footprint.
“I’d like to see Senate Democrats tell seniors who have seen their hard-earned retirement savings literally melt away as the markets track toward their worst month since 1931,” McConnell said.","['stunt', 'embarrassed']"
"Despite pre-existing and new guidelines, critical decisions made by governors and state leadership have, in some cases, exacerbated the crisis. In New York, Gov. Cuomo’s instruction for long-term care facilities to continue accepting patients with COVID-19 led to devastating results.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/29/heres-why-over-40-percent-of-all-coronavirus-deaths-come-from-nursing-homes/,federalist,coronavirus,right,70.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"A combination of factors add up to make losses in long-term care facilities one of the largest disasters of the pandemic, leaving nursing homes and their residents exposed to COVID-19.
Nursing homes and their occupants currently account for more than 43 percent of all coronavirus fatalities in the United States as of May 26, according to Forbes. Reporting from the New York Times detailed that by May 11, COVID-19 had already infected more than 153,000 patients at over 7,700 facilities nation-wide.
While that statistic demonstrates the widespread nature of the crisis, what’s more alarming is that by the date of the New York Time’s analysis, only 11 percent of total US COVID cases originated at nursing homes, but over 35 percent of the total number of deaths come from long-term care facilities. As of now, that number has climbed another five percentage points on a national level. Some individual states have it much worse than the national average.
Last Tuesday, Pennsylvania released an assessment of its COVID-19 numbers, detailing, among other things, every coronavirus case on record in their long-term stay facilities. According to the Pennsylvania National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA-NEDSS), there are a reported 2,852 deaths across 558 nursing homes statewide. And while some nursing homes have managed to get away without having a single case, others, such as Northampton Country Home in Gracedale, have seen as many as 205 cases and 44 deaths at a single facility. Either way, deaths in nursing homes have hit Pennsylvania disproportionately. As of May 19, the state’s total number of deaths was 4,624, making long-term nursing facility patients upwards of 60 percent of total COVID-related deaths in the state.
New Jersey has reported cases of coronavirus in up to 80 percent of all of its nursing home facilities. And between March 1 and May 1, the state of New York lost more than 4,800 elderly citizens in nursing homes, prompting Gov. Andrew Cuomo to call extended-stay facilities “feeding frenzies” for the virus.
A Familiar Crisis on a Bigger Scale
A 2008 study from the Journal of Post-Acute and Long-Term Medicine found that 20 to 24 percent of all deaths in the United States occurred in nursing homes. Of those, 23 percent were caused by pulmonary or respiratory complications.
Another study from JAMDA in 2015 found similar results concerning length of stay. The study found that nearly 12 percent of residents in long-term care facilities died after one year of admission. About a quarter of first-year residents were hospitalized at least once.
So what makes COVID-19 so detrimental to nursing homes isn’t only its mortality rate, but rather also its ability to spread as aggressively among a particularly susceptible population.
Efforts to stop the spread have not failed for a lack of trying. Both the Centers for Medicare and & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelines on how to respond to COVID in nursing homes. The CDC in particular issued numerous resources such as their Key Strategies for Long-Term Care Facilities, the Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Tool for Nursing Homes Preparing for COVID-19, and the Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages. Each one of these resources provides extremely detailed procedures in an attempt to facilitate the fight against coronavirus for nursing home leadership. Many of these procedures aren’t new novel instructions.
Viruses aren’t a new to nursing homes either. Each year, nursing homes have to be very careful of viruses that could affect their residents. The spread of norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal virus, posed a serious concern to many in the long-care industry—especially between the years of 2009 and 2012. While the threat posed by norovirus was significantly lower than coronavirus, many of the methods of preventing norovirus are similar to the procedures and methods to stop COVID, including techniques like isolation and distancing between patients. But even with these practices in place, virus management is only half of the problem.
Mixed Signals and Instructions
Despite pre-existing and new guidelines, critical decisions made by governors and state leadership have, in some cases, exacerbated the crisis. In New York, Gov. Cuomo’s instruction for long-term care facilities to continue accepting patients with COVID-19 led to devastating results. His mandate came after the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (ADMA) issued a warning about transferring coronavirus patients in and out of nursing home facilities. In their brief titled, “Transfer of Hospital Patients to PALTC settings,” ADMA explicitly laid out the dangers presented by COVID exposure to care facilities:
“Unsafe transfers will increase the risk of transmission in PALTC facilities, which will ultimately only serve to increase the return flow back to hospitals, overwhelming capacity, endangering more healthcare personnel, and escalating the burden on hospitals,” ADMA experts said.
AMDA further laid out that nursing homes should not accept COVID patients and that an infected patient discovered on the premises should be carefully separated from other residents.
As a result of climbing losses, Cuomo has since rescinded his mandate, but not before garnering backlash for the decision. Many like Janice Dean, a meteorologist for Fox News, blame the governor’s decision for the death of elderly loved ones.
In Michigan, Sen. Peter Lucido is calling for an investigation from the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney into why Gov. Gretchen Whitmer forced nursing homes to accept COVID-positive residents, in an order similar to Cuomo’s. Whitmer denies the claims, saying that her mandate made no such thing explicitly mandatory, but with over 2,300 cases of coronavirus presently in Michigan nursing homes, her critics aren’t swayed by the explanation.
“Why would you want to bring an infected COVID patient into a nursing home where the most vulnerable people in the state are living?” Lucido asked ABC news.
Uncertainty of Scale
As devastating as the numbers are, part of the problem with addressing the COVID-19’s impact on nursing homes is the uncertainly of cases reported. The numbers could be higher.
Only in the past week have the CDC and healthcare provides required nursing homes to record and report cases. Up until this point, individual nursing homes may have been keeping track of cases, but not in a required format. Medicare and Medicaid have put out a set of requirements that, going forward, will call for specific numbers that started Sunday, May 24. Facilities that don’t start reporting until May 31 will receive a warning notice from the CDC for violating of the mandate.
The instructions come along with the CDC-issued “Human Infection 2019 Novel Coronavirus Case Report Form.” The new form includes case classification and verification, hospitalization and ICU details, case demographics, exposure information, and clinical symptom history. These measures aim to pin down the patterns and elements having an impact on a nursing-home population.
But with more than two months of crisis already in the books, experts like Thomas Perls, a Professor of Medicine at Boston University, believe this mandate comes too late to assure accurate and reliable reporting.
Perls notes that a lack of systemic case tracking—specifically in nursing homes—has been a trend in other countries as well, one that’s allowed additional infection to sneak under the radar.
“The missing cases [in nursing homes] could dramatically skew the national death count.” Perls said. “When France started reporting death data from some of its nursing homes, the daily COVID-19 fatality numbers almost doubled.”
The Trump Administration decided it will not require long-term care facilities to report numbers of cases prior to May 6. Perls’ concern is that too many cases have slipped through for the United States to have a comprehensive understanding of the area of effect the virus has had on long-term care facilities even after the implementation of a report requirement.
Depleted nursing staffs, struggling to keep their heads above water, will also make gathering an accurate county unlikely. According to PBS news, it’s not just the patients that are struggling. Staff shortages due to COVID-19 directly impact residents, leaving many without the attention they need on a daily basis.
Charlene Harrington, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco and an expert in nursing home services, told CBS News that part of the problem is a lack of resources—both in terms of a qualified workforce and medical capacity.
“Before the pandemic, 75 percent of the nursing homes did not have enough staff, especially registered nurses,” Harrington said, “and registered nurses are essential for infection control, for assessing residents and managing the staff in nursing homes.”
Now exacerbated by the crisis, a lack of trained professionals is translating to a lack of comprehensive tracking inside long-term care facilities and a loss of life.","['exacerbated', 'devastating', 'critical']"

The ads do not mention gun control failures, rather, they simply point to incidents in which guns were used criminally and point to the resulting harm as justification for more gun laws.
For example, Bloomberg is running an ad that uses the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack to push more gun control now. The ad mentions the fact that 32 innocents were killed in the firearm-based attack but says nothing about the fact that the attack occurred in a gun-free zone. In other words, that attack occurred in an area with 100 percent gun control.
Moreover, the ad says nothing about the fact that the attacker used handguns, not an “assault weapon.” And the ad does not inform viewers that the attacker passed a background check to acquire the guns.
None of these failures are evident in Bloomberg’s ad. Instead, the focus is on how much gun control would supposedly make us safer:
In 2007, a gunman killed 32 people and wounded over a dozen others at Virginia Tech — including Colin Goddard. By making sure that guns don't fall into the wrong hands, we can save lives. Mike plans to do just that: https://t.co/rFldrBeb4H pic.twitter.com/qH6ZOEMWBk — Team Bloomberg (@Mike2020) January 31, 2020
Ironically, bans on “high-capacity” magazines are part of the Bloomberg campaign’s gun control push, yet a Virginia Tech review board found that such a ban would have had a negligible impact on the results of the 2007 attack.
On December 30, 2012, Breitbart News reported the review board’s finding that a ban forcing the attacker to use ten-round magazines instead of those that hold 15 rounds “would have not made that much difference in the incident.”
Such a ban would have been of little impact because the key element in such mass attacks is time, and the Virginia Tech attacker had all the time in the world because his targets could not shoot back; they were in a gun-free zone. In this sense, gun control actually contributed to the severity of the attack results.

“Were there any nice people among the folks who were screaming, “blood and soil,” “Jews will not replace us,’ — were there any nice people among them?” Green asked the white nationalism expert witnesses.
Christian Picciolini, founder of the Free Radicals Project and a former white nationalist, responded:
Sir, in my job, I have to believe there were nice people there because it is my job to try to pull them out. However, I think the statement of ‘very fine people’ was a very dangerous one, because it did equivocate two things that were not equal.
Green and Picciolini were referring to Trump’s frequently misconstrued remarks.
Trump delivered a speech after a rally in Charlottesville that began as a protest against removing a Confederate statue was marred by white supremacist violence.
In his speech, he referred to some of the non-violent protestors as “very fine people” but specifically condemned white supremacists and called them “criminals and thugs.” Trump said:
You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group – excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. … I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally. … Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.

They find a welcome audience in the mainstream media, which has always been willing to give a platform to those conservatives willing to bash other conservatives. (They deny that this is the game they are playing, because they maintain that Trump is not a real conservative, though he has governed as the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan.) They say they praise Trump when he deserves it — though they clearly savor the criticism more.
During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge. NeverTrumpers imagined they would be the last conservatives standing atop the rubble of the movement, able to set the agenda and the boundaries. After the election, most ignored calls for reconciliation.
Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.
The path ahead is a conservative primary challenge to Trump in 2020, and the foundations are being laid now.
For such a challenge to be successful, NeverTrump would have to coalesce around only one candidate — and not to persist, as it did throughout the 2016 primary, with a divided field of contenders. Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters.
The case NeverTrump and its candidate will have to make is that while they are grateful (ahem) for Trump’s success in defeating Hillary Clinton, most of his other achievements for the cause could have been done by any Republican president, and few other Republicans would come with Trump’s disadvantages. They have to hope that Democrats continue to flounder, so that a primary challenge would not seem a threat to the GOP’s 2020 prospects as a whole.
The biggest problem for NeverTrump, however, is the pitiful performance of the Republican Congress, which has been unable to act on its core priorities, and reinforces the notion that only Trump is strong enough to lead the party.
Nevertheless, NeverTrump sees in the 2020 race a reason to persist. It will continue to cast its fight as a principled one. Much of it, however, is about power and revenge. Apparently, NeverTrump cannot forgive Trump for winning.

In the municipality of Pullach the proposal for the third gender bathrooms comes after the idea was put forward by an external school advisor, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports.
While the Pullach spokeswoman claimed that the town had not currently even begun the planning stages of a third gender bathroom, the city of Garching said that they had already put the plans in place, and the third school, in the community of Taufkirchen, said they had consulted with an architectural firm about the idea.
The schools would be the first in Bavaria to adopt third gender bathrooms, with a spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Education confirming that they were not aware of any other schools that had adopted the idea.
Germany Approves Third Gender, ‘Diverse’, for Official Documents https://t.co/bG6SDGZ0YX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 14, 2018
The proposal comes only a month after Germany’s parliament approved of allowing individuals to mark a third gender on their passports and other government documents, following a court ruling that allowed the government the option to scrap gender altogether from official identification papers.
Germany is not the only country to back third gender options on documents. In May of 2018, a Dutch court ruled that lawmakers must recognize the supposed need for a third gender option, writing that “the time is ripe for recognition of a third gender” and going on to call on lawmakers to produce new legislation.
Canada, one of the global leaders of the “progressive” gender agenda, introduced the option of gender “x” on Canadian passports in 2017 to support the Liberal Party government’s “agenda on gender equality, diversity and inclusion.”

"Among rich lefties, perhaps, this new reality was acceptable, as it dovetailed with their guilt over their own success.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/08/02/not-white-threat-harming-politics-tying-race-destiny/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,71.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The changes in the way race plays into national politics are not a reaction to Barack Obama. They are a reaction to the world progressives built and are still building.
Ezra Klein’s Monday article in Vox addressed race in politics, comparing the election of Barack Obama with the election of Donald Trump. It was longer and more nuanced than most of what is published there, but still missed the major point.
The changes in the way race plays into national politics are not a reaction to Obama. They are a reaction to the world progressives built and are still building, a world that has seen the Left’s default position go from aspiring toward color-blindness to one of grievance-nursing along every possible intersectional axis. The political world that gave us Trump is different than the one that gave us Obama, but the difference is of the Left’s own making.
Demographics Aren’t Destiny
Klein begins with the latest version of the demographics-as-destiny argument. That theory was popularized in John Judis and Ruy Teixeira’s 2002 book, “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” and used to run something like this: as immigration from places other than Europe shifts America’s demographics, the percentage of non-white voters will rise. These voters will vote Democratic with the same uniformity as black Americans currently do, and their votes will eventually be so numerous that they will reduce the Republican Party to a permanent second place.
The next election after Judis and Teixeira’s book debuted was George W. Bush’s electoral and popular vote majority, but theories in the political world are not derailed by mere events. Demographics-as-destiny adherents focused on the “emerging” part of the title and held out hope for the day their favored politicians would win simply by existing and America would become a California writ large. Obama’s 2008 election and somewhat reduced majority in 2012 maintained the fiction, and things looked bright for the Left.
Trump’s election in 2016 changed that, as it changed nearly every working theory of American politics. Writers like Klein did not waver in their belief that Republicans would soon be swamped by numbers of unflinching Democratic voters, but added a corollary: before the apotheosis of progressivism, there would be rear-guard action by the forces of reaction. The ever-racist whites would hold off the forces of goodness and decency until even greater numbers finally swamped them. That, in brief, is the subject of Klein’s latest article.
From Facts To Faction
But even before Trump’s refutation of the theory, there was a shift in the demographics argument’s delivery. The original idea involved political scientists looking at numbers, extrapolating them into the future, and saying what they thought it would mean for the country.
It is not wrong to say these things; facts are facts, trends can be predicted based on them. But the underlying premise should make Americans a little uneasy. People vote as individuals, but progressives too often see them only as groups, the sum of their intersections. The demographic argument suggests that DNA determines our votes more than free will does, in a weird secular pre-destinationism.
The tenor of that argument changed as 2016’s election approached. Neutral recitation of the facts gave way in some writers’ work to gleeful anticipation of white people’s diminution. As the intersectional movement moved from academia to mainstream, some on the far-left dropped the powerful liberal idea of color-blind equality in favor of a system of permanent conflict between races, religions, ethnicities, and classes. All differences were deemed vectors of oppression, and the cause of it all was white people.
Articles of this sort abounded, as in like a 2015 work from Salon (“White guys are killing us”) or a 2016 article from the Huffington Post (“Democrats Don’t Need White Men to Win”). One might argue that these outlets are not the arbiters of mainstream opinion, but one of the leveling effects of the Internet is that any article can go viral.
Establishment lefties might have kept the triumphal attitude out of their pieces, but that discretion did not extend to all corners of their coalition. Since the election, things have only gotten crazier. When these articles and others like them spread through social media, that spirit of ugly, factional, demographic-inspired triumph signaled to left-leaning voters that this sort of open distaste for a large segment of the population was acceptable.
It’s Not Just Demographic Displacement
More importantly, electorally speaking, is that many white Democrats got that message, too. Their party and the Clinton campaign (which were essentially the same thing in 2016) spent all their energy hailing what Ronald Brownstein in 2012 called the “coalition of the ascendant.” But the message filtered down to the people not as one of a rising tide lifting all demographic boats into a new, more equal America, but of one group clambering over another for control of the levers of power.
How many people in the reciprocal “coalition of the descending” could be expected to remain behind in a Democratic Party that gleefully prophesied their fade into insignificance? Having been told that the melting pot was a lie and that their very existence caused oppression along countless intersecting vectors, how many could be expected not to defend themselves?
Among rich lefties, perhaps, this new reality was acceptable, as it dovetailed with their guilt over their own success. But for the middle and working classes, it constituted only a threat, and a demand that they be held responsible for the deeds of an establishment that had never included them or their blue-collar ancestors.
My colleague David Marcus picked up on this point earlier than most, writing in May 2016 that “this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.”
In abandoning color-blind equality as a goal, the far-left all but dared white people to adopt their theories and emphasize their own racial identity, even over the more unifying identity of our shared Americanism and above even our shared humanity. Sadly, this appealed to some of what became known as the alt-right. The right-wing establishment had adopted the racial equality platform that began on the Left, but instead of consolidating that victory and working together toward greater racial harmony, the Left got more radical, as the nature of progressivism demands.
Equality was seen as unachievable, so grievance-balancing intersectionality would take its place. As a bonus, such a system of finely balanced intersectional offenses required constant debate and, ultimately, gatekeepers to determine which historical wrongs were greatest. That gives a small elite a great deal of power, in contrast to the simpler virtue of just leaving people alone and treating everyone equally.
Abandoning equality when they thought it was of no more use to them, they showed their true face to people.
All of which is to say, Klein misses the point when he acts as though Trumpian resentment sprang up on the Right ex nihilo. Klein begins his essay about white racial resentment with the election of Obama, our first black president. While we should not say that one black chief executive signaled the end of racism in America, it does at least signal that a majority of people were not so enthralled by white grievances that they could not elect a black man to be the leader of the free world.
Yet that same electorate’s turn to Trump is seen as evidence that white Americans are relentlessly racist. What could have caused the change? Klein points to the demography, but that has been changing forever and should have helped his side, not hurt it.
The new factor in the electorate equation was the attitude around that demography, and the Left’s premature celebration when they thought the game was won. Abandoning equality when they thought it was of no more use to them, they showed their true face to people, including those to whom equality still meant something.
That, at best, leaves one party still dedicated to that ideal. At worst, it leaves none, with both parties becoming rival factions nursing competing racial resentments.
The Equation Does Not Balance
Beyond misplacing the blame, Klein and those like him misunderstand the nature of race in politics. Specifically, they think that not only will demographic changes continue into the future, but that 2018’s definitions of race will continue as well.
But history shows that this has never been the case. For a country that has long been preoccupied with race, America’s standard definitions of race have undergone considerable change. They will continue to do so.
Even if the Democrats are correct that they will receive the vast majority of minority votes, they are wrong that our current politically motivated definitions of whiteness and non-whiteness will remain the same. Klein briefly engages with this point, though he ultimately ignores it: “Demographers can and do disagree over whether these projections will hold. Perhaps Hispanic whites will begin identifying simply as whites in the coming years, much as the Irish became white in the 20th century. Race is what we make of it, and what we make of it shifts and mutates.”
For a country that has long been preoccupied with race, America’s standard definitions of race have undergone considerable change.
There’s no “perhaps” about it. This change has been going on forever, and attempts to ignore it are willful blindness motivated by politics. In the twenty-first century, politicos speak of the historical dominance of white people and their oppression of non-whites, but that is not how people thought of themselves in those days.
In Theodore Roosevelt’s time, people in the establishment (including TR himself) spoke not of the white race but of the Anglo-Saxon people. That narrow definition of the people they desired to see in charge of things was big enough to admit other Protestants of colonial heritage (including Roosevelt’s New York Dutch ancestors), but not enough to admit the Irish, Italians, Jews, Greeks, and Slavs who had made up most of the immigrants over the previous half-century. These, they believed, were utterly foreign and had cultures at odds with American values.
How things changed. Klein notes that the Irish “became white in the 20th century,” and he is correct. Indeed, the Irish are so thoroughly white that it seems now ridiculous to suggest that they are anything but white. Other groups that immigrated around the same time have likewise been welcomed into the establishment, accessing its societal benefits and costs alike.
There is no reason to believe that other white-looking people like Arabs and Persians will be long excluded. Indeed, their identification as non-white people is primarily a political matter at a time when access to intersectional vectors of oppression is more politically advantageous than “becoming white.” Even the term “white” may be eclipsed by some new artifact of racial ideology or pseudoscience
This goes to show how race is far more a matter of politics and social theory than of biology. No matter what 23andMe says about our DNA, how we view ourselves—and how others view us—is far more mutable. The groups we now call “white” and “people of color” are constructed by political alliances of convenience, not biological facts, just as the so-called Anglo-Saxon people was. Increased intermarriage between whites and non-whites will blur these artificial lines even further. They have changed, and will continue to change.
Racial Grievance Politics Are Already Changing
Already the ground is shifting. Affirmative action, once intended to redress the harms of white discrimination against non-whites, is now being used to limit Asians’ college admission as well. Does that mean they are beginning to be no longer a part of the awkwardly named “people of color” coalition? Or more to the point Klein brings up: evidence exists that many Hispanic people identify themselves as white. Does that disqualify them from the “coalition of the ascendant?”
They encourage people to align their politics to their race instead of their values.
Race is not something that is projectable as a trend, and even discussing it in such fine detail—who is white? who isn’t?—feels kind of gross and un-American. That is the biggest problem with observations like Klein’s: by drawing attention to the many variations within the American people, they exacerbate the divisions between us. By imputing political judgments to entire races, they encourage people to align their politics to their race instead of their values.
The real solution to racial grievances in politics is to return to the old liberal American idea of aspiring toward equality, no matter how difficult that goal may be to attain. Instead of focusing on where people are coming from, let’s talk about where they are headed, who they are in joining the American melting pot and becoming every bit as American as those who were born here.
Some Trump voters have come to adopt grievance politics, and Democrats have endorsed that platform for years. They all should reconsider their choices, make politics about ideas, not skin color, and return to the universal American values that once brought us together.",['lefties']
"My point is that it was a bait-and-switch, and not in a crazed, left-wing state like California. ",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/01/07/nolte-virginia-proves-democrats-top-priority-is-to-confiscate-your-guns/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,71.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"No Democrats in Virginia ran on gun confiscation, but that was the first thing Virginia’s Democrats tried to do once they obtained that power.
Oh, I know a backlash eventually forced Virginia Democrats to back off the confiscation idea, and that it is more of a “Confiscation-Lite” proposal now, one where you can either register your guns with the government or have them taken away. That’s not my point.
My point is that confiscation was the Democrats’ top priority after obtaining power. My point is that it was a bait-and-switch, and not in a crazed, left-wing state like California. This is Virginia we’re talking about. A southern state; the home of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington; a largely rural state that is unfortunately plagued with big blue population centers.
Here’s a rundown of how the bait-and-switch worked.
As my colleague AWR Hawkins reported, in order to distract from his blackface scandal, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam first proposed gun confiscation last January.
During the election that took place the following November, however, no Virginia Democrats ran on agreeing with this proposal.
But then, within days of grabbing hold of total control of all three legislative branches in Virginia, we learned that…
Virginia lawmakers are now considering a state law banning the ownership of certain semi-automatic guns deemed “assault firearms” and limiting the magazine capacity of other firearms in the state — and there are no clauses that would allow existing owners to continue possessing them. Virginia state Sen. Richard Saslaw introduced SB16, which would expand the definition of an “assault firearm” to cover many different semi-automatic rifles and pistols. The bill would call for the ban of such firearms, barring people from purchasing, possessing, selling or transferring those weapons. Among the changes in firearm definitions, the bill would expand the term “assault firearm” to include semi-automatic centerfire rifles and pistols with a fixed magazine capacity greater than 10 rounds. The bill would also ban semi-automatic rifles and pistols with detachable magazines that also have folding and telescoping stocks, barrel shrouds, and thumbhole grips and second hand grips.
Boom! Wham! Gun-grabbing!
Straight out of the gate, gun-grabbing.
And the only thing that stopped Democrats from confiscating guns, from making thousands of law-abiding American outlaws with the stroke of a pen, was an unexpected and unexpectedly belligerent pushback from rural counties in Virginia, over a hundred of them that promised to defy these extremist laws through sanctuary counties.
To date, some 118 Virginia counties have declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries. This all happened within weeks of the Democrat takeover and the confiscation threat. What this means is that in these particular countries, local law enforcement agree to not enforce anti-gun laws, especially dangerous radical ones like confiscation, bans, mandatory registration, and limiting the size of magazines.
It was only after this that Democrats finally backed down to what I call a “Confiscation-Lite” proposal where you can either agree to register what the government declares an “assault weapon” or you can hand it over.
One Virginia Democrat has gone so far as to seriously propose the state use the National Guard to enforce these extreme gun control laws in the counties that refuse. Can you imagine? Northam says he opposes that idea, but even if you take him at his word (and why would you?), he still wants you to register with the state. So now the state knows who owns the guns, and after Northam leaves office in 2021, what happens when Virginia gets a governor who is in favor of using the Guard?
You see how this works?
Let’s not forget this is the “you can keep your insurance and doctor” party.
Now let’s talk about Burisma Joe Biden.
Biden now claims he isn’t running on gun confiscation, just “Confiscation-Lite” through a national AR-15 registration and a ban. Even if you believe him (and I don’t) this is still a flip-flop, because Burisma Biden was originally in favor of confiscation. Here are Biden’s own words from a Democrat Primary debate in August: [emphasis added]
Folks, look, and I would buy back [assault] weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that’s a good expenditure of money.
When pressed on this in a subsequent interview, Biden refused to answer:
BIDEN: What I would do is — I would try to — I would institute a national buyback program and I would move it in the direction to making sure that that in fact is what we try to do, get them off the street. CNN: But that’s not confiscating… BIDEN: No, that’s not walking into their homes, knocking on their doors, going through their gun cabinet, et cetera. CNN: So people would be allowed to keep the weapons they already have? BIDEN: Right now, there’s no legal way that I’m aware that you could deny them the right to have purchased (ph) — legally purchase them.
Notice how Biden never answers the question. He doesn’t say he would never sign or pursue a confiscation law. He only says “Right now, there’s no legal way…” Obviously, the fake news gun-grabbers at CNN were not going to pin him down.
The FIRST thing Democrats in Virginia did after obtaining power was to pursue outright gun confiscation.
That is who these people really are, that is their true goal, and once we’re all registered through these “Confiscation-Lite” programs, like the one proposed by Biden, the Democrats’ stated goal of confiscating our guns will become much, much, much easier.

It’s also true that in no time in modern American history has a president’s disposition and rhetoric conflicted more dramatically with the outcomes of his administration. But that has been a net win for the Constitution.,https://thefederalist.com/2018/06/27/was-gorsuch-worth-a-trump-presidency-its-starting-to-look-that-way/,federalist,trump-presidency,right,72.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A presidency is more than one man, and so far, the Constitution is winning.
It’s odd, isn’t it, that so many of the folks who warn us about the authoritarianism of the GOP also happen to support an array of policies that coerce Americans to do things they don’t want to?
Take, for example, the four reliably liberal Supreme Court justices, all of whom believe it’s OK to compel Americans to pay dues to political organizations they disagree with, to coerce them to say things they abhor, and to compel them to create things that undermine their principles.
For some, myself included, the prospects of a court run by people who ignore the Constitution was the best argument for Donald Trump in 2016. The question was, “What’s scarier, a Trump presidency or a progressive Supreme Court?” I imagine the answer is becoming a bit clearer for many conservatives.
In three cases this term — the rulings that stopped the Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission from destroying Jack Phillips’ business over a thought crime, California’s attempt to force people to support abortion, and public-sector unions from continuing their long-standing policy of forcing workers to fund their political activities — the court has handed the Constitution clear wins.
I mean, has there been a bigger win for small-government, real-life conservatives over the past few decades than the Janus v. AFSCME ruling? The decision not only fortifies the First Amendment by explicitly finding compelled speech unconstitutional, but also calls out the Left’s authoritarian political machinery, which has been holding many American communities, school systems, and workers hostage for decades.
“It is hard to estimate how many billions of dollars have been taken from nonmembers and transferred to public-sector unions in violation of the First Amendment,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority. “Those unconstitutional exactions cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.”
The Janus ruling also stipulates that employees must now affirmatively opt-in — rather than having to opt out — of unions before having to pay fees. The court understood that dollars are fungible, and every one of them should be considered a matter of speech.
Certainly, it would not have been the case had Hillary won. We know this by taking a peek at a counterhistory offered by reading the liberal dissents.
“The First Amendment,” writes Justice Elena Kagan, “was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance — including over the role of public-sector unions.” The idea that the court should decide who deserves First Amendment protections, or that those protections should be contingent on the vagaries of “democratic governance,” whatever that means, is as corrupt as any of the dumb things Trump has ever said about free expression. The Supreme Court is built to withstand the whims of democracy, of majoritarianism, not to surrender to them. (Then again, Kagan gives away her political game when she worries that “Public employee unions will lose a secure source of financial support.”)
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, accused the majority of weaponizing the First Amendment — an unconscionable position for a person tasked with “faithfully and impartially” discharging the duty to protect the inherent rights of all Americans. The dissenters have perverted the intent of the Founders. It’s none of Sotomayor’s business how we use free expression. It’s her business to protect it.
And in an environment where Americans are increasingly drifting apart ideologically, culturally, and politically on virtually every major issue, gridlock has become the de facto state of affairs in DC, and the court becomes even more important. Whatever Trump’s predilections or beliefs might be, to this point the First Amendment has been strengthened under this presidency.
Don’t get me wrong: Trump’s attacks on the press can be harmful and gratuitous (though, of course, not every tweet critical of CNN is an attack on the foundations of the First Amendment). Yet they are far less consequential than allowing SCOTUS to codify attacks on free expression.
Not that we should forget that we can thank Mitch McConnell for giving Trump the Neil Gorsuch seat. The much-disparaged Senate leader withstood immense political pressure and preposterous attacks when stopping President Obama from stacking the court.
But the president kept his word when it came to the Court. It’s still early in the Trump era, of course, and we really have no idea how the residual political effects of our acute partisan battles or investigations or ugly rhetoric or the often-incompetent presidency will manifest in the long term. Perhaps Trump’s unpopularity will make it harder for originalists to find their way to the Supreme Court in the future. Perhaps not. It’s also true that in no time in modern American history has a president’s disposition and rhetoric conflicted more dramatically with the outcomes of his administration. But that has been a net win for the Constitution.","['rhetoric', 'conflicted', 'dramatically']"

A new poster campaign from the Pride Resource Center at the university states that the phrase “ladies and gentlemen” is “extremely degrading and designed to harm.” The poster refers to the phrase as a “slur.”
The Pride Resource Center explained on a page on the university website that the posters were designed to outline some of the difficulties that transgender individuals face.
This poster is intended to raise awareness and skills about some of the experiences trans students often face. While displaying the poster is a great way to demonstrate support, it is important to remember that this is only one small step. In addition to hanging this poster, we invite folks to explore the specific barriers that trans students may face in your areas/offices/services. Posters are available at the main desks of the Pride Resource Center (236 Lory Student Center) and in the Women and Gender Advocacy Center’s main office (112 Student Services Building) during regular business hours.
One can support transgender rights while rejecting the type of word policing that could result in professional or academic consequences for everyday Americans. Based on campus anti-bias policies, it is likely that the use of this phrase could result in university sanctions against the speaker.
It is hard to argue that the phrase “ladies and gentlemen” is used specifically to insult non-binary or transgender individuals. The suggestion that the use of this phrase is a real threat to transgender individuals downplays their actual struggle for acceptance in modern America.

A German doctor, Cornelia Strunz, who works at the Desert Flower Center said that the number of cases of FGM in Germany is rising due to increased migration from Islamic African and Asian countries, dubbed the ‘FGM Zone’ where the practice is widespread.
She advised women and girls who have undergone the procedure to have another surgery to reverse the damage caused by FGM.
“Many women have problems emptying their bladder after FGM. Menstrual blood can’t drain properly. For some, sex becomes practically impossible. Women can also develop fistulas — connections between two body parts which should not exist at all in normal circumstances. One example would be a link between the vagina and rectum, leading to them passing stools through the vagina. Obviously, that’s not very easy to live with”, Dr Strunz told Deutsche Welle.

Shadia Abdelmoneim, a Sudanese woman living in Germany, had her genitals cut by her midwife while she was under anaesthetic, after the birth of her third child.
“I wanted to go to the toilet, but something wasn’t right. I couldn’t walk and was in considerable pain. When I saw what she had done, I was shocked. She’d cut everything open and then sewn it closed. I had no idea what to do”, Shadia told DW.
She told the German paper that the trauma led to a constant state of fear, for herself and for her three young daughters.
“How could women do something like that to one another, how? Being circumcised is like living in a dead body”, she said mournfully.
In response to the rising epidemic, Berlin is establishing its first anti-FGM centre, however, activists have called for more action including information campaigns that target the families of at-risk children.
“Many teachers and school staff aren’t well informed and don’t recognize the warning signs that a girl’s at risk of FGM. Sometimes, they also struggle to approach the issue in a sensitive manner”, said Charlotte Weil of the Terre des Femmes women’s rights charity, but warned that “a thousand-year-old tradition cannot be abolished in a couple of years.”

He then criticized the attempt to lump Republicans and white nationalists into the same group.,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/08/24/mike-rowe-schools-critic-on-facebook-who-accuses-him-of-siding-with-white-nationalists/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,72.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Mike Rowe, former host of the television show Dirty Jobs, fired back against a critic who accused him of siding with white nationalists in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Rowe posted on Facebook Tuesday a comment written to him:
One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitests. Comment? No? I’m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don’t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country – promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin’ our ass academically.
“Since we’re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post,” Rowe fired back. “Everything about it annoys me –your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position.”
Rowe then dismantled each of Atkins’ unsubstantiated points. He lambasted celebrities for constantly broadcasting their political opinions as though their views have any impact on most Americans:
I’m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it’s “bad for business,” but because it’s annoying. I can’t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I’m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine.
He then criticized the attempt to lump Republicans and white nationalists into the same group:
You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an “academic elite.” You then say that Republicans promote “anti-intellectualism.” You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn’t matter – your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief. Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common – a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans “love” me because they believe that my initiative and “their” initiative are one and the same. But of course, “their” initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you’ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things “intellectual.” And poof – just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I’m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis!
Rowe goes on to argue that millions of people across the political divide have concerns about the state of higher education, noting that universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world:
Millions of reasonable people – Republicans and Democrats alike – are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They’re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities – once beacons of free speech – now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can’t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they’re concerned – deeply concerned – that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don’t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it.
“In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn’t care less. My question is, why do you?” Rowe finished.",['lump']
"Every corporate mainstream media organization has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tariffs were hurting U.S. consumers.",https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/01/17/washington-post-tariffs-did-not-raise-prices/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,72.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"It’s been a long haul. But finally, the truth about tariffs has become unavoidable.
For over 18 months, Breitbart News has been reporting that consumer prices were not significantly rising due to tariffs. We have been virtually alone in this reporting among news organizations, although Alan Tonelson has done a fine job of sifting through the data on his own. Every corporate mainstream media organization has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tariffs were hurting U.S. consumers.
But now the facts have become undeniable even for the mainstream media. On Friday, the Washington Post published a piece by reporter Heather Long explaining that the predictions of consumers paying higher prices because of tariffs were just wrong.
“Gail Ross can tell you two things with certainty: Americans, not the Chinese, are paying for President Trump’s tariffs. And second, most of the costs were absorbed by U.S. companies, which is why consumers haven’t seen excessive sticker shock at stores,” Long writes.
This is what Breitbart News has reported, based on publicly available data ignored by the anti-tariff crowd for over a year. U.S. companies, their bottom lines boosted by Trump’s tax cuts, have absorbed most of the tariffs instead of passing them on to U.S. households.
“Although many big corporations reacted to the announcement of tariffs with warnings that consumers would be forced to pay higher prices, the evidence so far is that corporations have been forced to absorb the costs of tariffs rather than passing them on. Instead of squeezing the pocketbooks of American households, the tariffs are putting pressure on record-high corporate profits,” Breitbart News reported in May 2018.
Now we get this from the Washington Post:
Headlines last year proclaimed Trump’s tariffs could cost the typical American family $1,000 more a year. The eye-popping number came from a JPMorgan analysis that assumed the full cost of the tariffs would be passed on to consumers, which is what is generally taught in introductory economics classes. But that is not what’s been happening. The evidence so far indicates that most American firms passed only a fraction of the cost increase on to consumers — more in the range of $100 per family a year… But a recent study by economists at Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston went a step further, examining data from two large retailers on prices of similar goods, some of which face tariffs and some that do not. The economists found a “quite modest” price difference, suggesting that U.S. companies and retailers are eating a lot of the costs and making lower profits. The price hike for affected dishes, furniture, linens, toaster ovens, towels and umbrellas was less than 1 percent, the study found. And the price for electronics only went up by 1.4 percent.
This is a significant breakthrough. Each new round of tariff was greeted with panicky headlines predicting that U.S. consumers would be squeezed by rising prices as retailers and importers passed the cost of tariffs on to shoppers.
“Trump’s trade war may soon hit consumers’ wallets and paychecks,” NBC News declared in a headline last year.
“Tariffs will surely lead to higher prices for imported goods and, to a lesser extent, prices for non-imported goods that use imported materials,” the University of Pennsylvania’s business school Wharton reported.
“Tariffs are about to hit consumers, and it won’t be pretty,” CNBC claimed.
“Trade restrictions, by their nature, result in price increases for the goods in question. If the price of steel and aluminum goes up, manufacturers will be forced to pass those costs onto American consumers,” wrote Tori K. Whiting, the Jay Van Andel Trade Economist at the Heritage Foundation’s Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies.
This was a major failing by the American media, misleading the American people for over a year-and-a-half about the effects of tariffs.
Breitbart readers, of course, knew the true story all along.","['without', 'evidence']"
Top Six Awful Democrat Ideas Senate Republicans Blocked from Coronavirus Bill...,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/five-awful-democrat-ideas-senate-republicans-blocked-from-coronavirus-bill/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,72.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Senate Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi successfully blocked swift passage of a coronavirus rescue package bill, but they did not get much from Republicans in return.
In the days following the negotiations, Republicans repeatedly swatted down additions to the bill proposed by Schumer, Pelosi, and Senate Democrats, despite their best efforts to deliver for select special interests.
Senate Democrats made a number of demands in the bill outside of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s wish-list bill that was 1,400 pages long, with no chances of getting passed.
“We weren’t going to give in to their demands,” a senior Republican leadership aide told Breitbart News. “This was not the time or the place, this was an emergency.”
Although Republicans ultimately allowed $75 million for public television and radio, $150 million for the Arts and Humanities, and $25 million for the Kennedy Center, several Democrat proposals were blocked.
Here are the top six items that Senate Republicans kept out of the bill, despite political pressure from the Democrats:
Money for Planned Parenthood: Senate Democrats wanted to bail out the abortion industry by allowing rescue funds for Planned Parenthood, one of their biggest non-profit allies. But Senate Republicans included language in the bill that ensured Planned Parenthood and other non-profits were not eligible. Democrats fought hard to remove the language but were met with a hard no. The bill also included language from the Hyde Amendment, ensuring that taxpayer funds would not directly pay for abortions. Green New Deal: Senate Democrats felt that the emergency spending bill was an opportunity to slip in tax breaks to benefit wind and solar energy. Senate Republicans refused, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hoisted their efforts to shoehorn green agenda interests as proof that Democrats were not serious about helping the country, as they voted to block the legislation. No Strings Funding for States: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried to make sure that the billions of dollars sent to states could be used to fill holes in their budgets, especially in blue states that were already in debt. Senate Republicans, however, made sure that the emergency funding granted to states be used for coronavirus-related expenses. The rule vexed New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other governors who wanted billions more funding with no strings attached. Federal Mandates for Early and Mail Voting: Congressional Democrats believed they could use the coronavirus crisis to create new federal mandates to override state election laws, forcing every state to develop early voting and elections through mail. Funding was ultimately sent to state election officials, but only for ways to protect voters from coronavirus. Postal Service Bailout: Democrats believed that the coronavirus crisis could be used to rescue the postal service, which continues to suffer massive deficits. Democrats wanted $20 billion in funding with no strings attached, but Senate Republicans replaced it with a loan that required them to spend it on the effects of the coronavirus. DHS Funding Restrictions: The bill includes transfer authorities that allows $289 million to be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, but Democrats wanted some strings attached to the funding regarding ICE and immigration enforcement. The effort failed.
Ultimately, Senate Democrats successfully achieved big increases in unemployment insurance payments, something that even drew protests from select Senate Republicans. But Republicans expressed satisfaction that the president and McConnell retained the proposal to send direct checks to the American people, which was something that many Democrats opposed.
“If Chuck Schumer had his way, he would have eliminated the direct checks,” one Senate Republican aide told Breitbart News.",['Awful']
The moment was yet another headache for Biden as he struggles to appeal to gun owners. ,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-rally-texas-buttigieg-klobuchar-endorsement?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20foxnews%2Fpolitics%20%28Internal%20-%20Politics%20-%20Text%29,federalist,gun-control,right,72.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In a surprise moment at the end of his Dallas rally on the eve of Super Tuesday, former Vice President Joe Biden called former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke up to the stage -- and vowed to put O'Rourke, who has said the government should forcibly seize assault rifles from Americans, in charge of gun-control efforts.
Also at the rally, Biden accepted the endorsements of onetime rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, as the Democratic party's moderate wing rallied behind Biden to challenge anti-establishment frontrunner and self-described ""democratic socialist"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
""Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, March 3, 2020, I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden,"" O'Rourke announced to applause at the rally's conclusion.
O'Rourke called President Trump an ""existential threat"" to ""free and fair elections,"" and urged rallygoers to view Biden as the ""antithesis of Donald Trump,"" someone who is ""decent, kind, caring, and empathetic.""
Biden, taking the microphone after O'Rourke spoke, then announced, ""I want to make something clear -- I'm gonna guarantee you, this is not the last you're seeing of this guy -- you're gonna take care of the gun problem with me, you're gonna be the one who leads this effort. I'm counting on you, I'm counting on you, we need you badly.""
O'Rourke has previously said he would like to seize all Americans' AR-15 assault rifles, promising: ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" at a Democratic primary debate last year, shortly before his campaign collapsed.
""Yikes,"" remarked Trump campaign spokesman Andrew Clark.
""Joe Biden promises Beto O'Rourke, who pushed for gun confiscation for legal gun owners, will 'be the one who leads' his gun control effort,"" observed GOP Rapid Response Director Steve Guest. ""2020 Democrats are unambiguous about their anti-Second Amendment agenda.""
Wrote NBC News' Benjy Sarlin: ""Biden hugging Beto going 'You’re going to take care of the gun problem for me!' is a thing you will see in a Republican ad someday.""
The moment was yet another headache for Biden as he struggles to appeal to gun owners. Last week, he bizarrely declared that ""150 million"" Americans -- approximately half the country -- had died due to gun violence since 2007.
Separately, Biden spent most of his time attacking President Trump, rather than his remaining rivals Elizabeth Warren, Sanders and Mike Bloomberg.
After Sen. Klobuchar, D-Minn., spoke earlier in the rally, Biden immediately sought to draw a contrast between her and Trump, saying the White House entirely lacks ""empathy and decency.""
BLOOMBERG PLANS FOR CONTESTED CONVENTION DURING FOX TOWN HALL
""Folks, I knew -- I believed that he wasn't going to be a very good president,"" Biden said. ""But I have to admit to you that Donald Trump, well, I didn't have any idea how much it was always going to be about Donald Trump. It's having a corrosive impact. It's having a corrosive impact on our children.""
Biden continued: ""The days of Donald Trump's divisiveness will soon be over. Folks, there's two ways people get inspired. They get inspired by great leaders like Lincoln and Roosevelt and Kennedy and Obama, but they also get inspired by very bad leaders. No, I really mean it. This president has sort of ripped the band-aid off, exposed just how venal he's become, and how he has literally strangled the life out of the Republican Party.""
""You're gonna take care of the gun problem with me."" — Joe Biden to Beto O'Rourke
At the same time, in Minnesota, Sanders and top surrogate Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar were rallying a boisterous crowd at a competing rally. Within hours, 14 states and one U.S. territory will head to the polls in contests that will award a whopping one-third of total delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
""It looks like St. Paul is ready for a political revolution,"" Sanders said to cheers.
At the rally in delegate-rich Texas, however, Biden and his new supporters argued that most voters want ""evolution"" and not a drastic change. Buoyed by his emphatic victory in Saturday's South Carolina primary, Biden has argued he's the only candidate who can realistically win over minority support and defeat Trump.
Klobuchar, who formally suspended her campaign earlier Monday, declared that Biden was the only sensible choice for voters who feel ""tired of the noise and the nonsense"" of today's politics.
""How great is it to be here in Dallas, Texas?"" Klobuchar asked. ""And how great it is to be here with my family. ... And with Vice President Biden! And how wonderful it is to be standing next to him on a stage when it isn't the debate stage?"" (Biden later joked that Klobuchar had ""won all the debates."")
It's time, Klobuchar said, for Americans to ""join hands instead of pointing fingers.""
""We need to unite our party and our country, and to do it not just with our words but with our actions,"" Klobuchar continued. ""It is up to us, all of us, to put our country back together, to heal this country, and then to build something even greater. I believe we can do this together. And that is why, today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president.""
Klobuchar and Biden then hugged as cheers of ""Let's go, Joe!"" broke out. Later, Klobuchar noted that Minnesota was also voting on Tuesday, and urged voters there to support Biden as well, amid concerns that her sudden withdrawal might actually help Sanders win the state.
Biden went on to thank Buttigieg for his endorsement earlier in the day as well. Speaking to supporters, Biden said Pete reminded him of his late son Beau during the debates -- a compliment Biden then falsely said he had not made before about any other politician.
""I’m looking for a leader, I’m looking for a president, who will draw out what’s best in each of us,” Buttigieg, who ended his campaign Sunday, told reporters prior to the rally. “We have found that leader in vice president, soon-to-be president, Joe Biden.”
BYRON YORK: WHY BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR VOTERS MIGHT NOT BACK BIDEN
In Minnesota, Sanders praised both Buttigieg and Klobuchar even as the two were in Texas to boost Biden.
""Tonight, I want to open the door to Amy's supporters, to Pete's supporters,"" he said. ""I know there are political differences, but I also know that virtually all of Amy's supporters and Pete's supporters understand that we've got to move toward a government that believes in justice, not greed.""
""I’ve known Amy for a very long time, and she is one of the hardest workers I know,"" Sanders said of Klobuchar before going on to call Buttigieg's campaign ""historic"" and ""brave,"" noting that Buttigieg would have been the first openly gay president.
Biden currently trails Sanders by just eight pledged delegates (56 to 48) in the race to get the 1,991 necessary to secure the Democratic party's nomination at this summer's convention in Milwaukee. Party leaders had feared that the splintering moderate vote would allow Sanders to rack up victories in a series of high-stakes Super Tuesday contests and possibly gain an insurmountable advantage in the delegate count.
However, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has resisted calls to clear the path for Biden, predicting Monday that Democrats would have a contested convention.
""The most likely scenario for the Democratic Party is no one has a majority -- it goes to a convention where there's horse-trading; there's compromise,"" Bloomberg said at a Fox News town hall in Manassas, Va., one of the states where voters will head to the polls Tuesday. ""It doesn't even have to be the leading candidate; it could be the one with a smaller number of delegates.""
Despite his endorsements and win by a massive margin in South Carolina's primary on Saturday, Biden remains vulnerable on a variety of fronts, including his repeated gaffes. On Monday, he slipped up twice during an earlier rally -- at one point, badly garbling the Declaration of Independence before giving up, and at another, saying ""Super Thursday"" was coming up.
And, although the Biden campaign reported back-to-back days of $5 million fundraising hauls following his South Carolina win, the former vice president has struggled to raise money more broadly.
In Silicon Valley, which dominated by the tech sector, many wealthy donors prioritize executing a data-driven plan -- and Biden’s rocky campaign pushed many toward Buttigieg or Bloomberg in recent months, financiers say.
Biden's team is waging a quiet campaign to win them over, yet many are taking a wait-and-see approach.
At Monday's gaffe-riddled rally, Biden notably didn't take any shots at Bloomberg and instead aimed his barbs at Sanders -- in an apparent sign that Bloomberg isn't viewed as a significant threat.
For his part, as midnight approached, Trump weighed in on Twitter to make clear he felt Biden's misstatements were very much a liability.
""WOW!"" Trump wrote. ""Sleepy Joe doesn’t know where he is, or what he’s doing. Honestly, I don’t think he even knows what office he's running for!""

Factual analyses have dismantled this false narrative put forth by some in the mainstream media.,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/03/16/niac-pushes-fake-news-trumps-ban-a-white-nationalist-effort-to-change-the-trajectory-of-immigration/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,72.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Monday, the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) hosted a panel discussion about President Donald Trump’s temporary visa ban, where the group’s policy director suggested the commander-in-chief’s executive order was a “white nationalist effort to change the trajectory of immigration” in the United States.
“Maybe a year ago it would have been crazy to say this,” Jamal Abdi said during the questions and answers segment of the panel. “But we’re in crazy times. This really looks like a Steve Bannon, Breitbart, you know, white nationalist effort to change the trajectory of immigration in this country.” He added:
And so, if you look at how this ban is constructed, it’s not just blocking new people from coming here. It’s ensuring that the people who are already here eventually have to leave. And Iranian-Americans, Muslim-Americans who can remain here, feel like second-class citizens and feel like they’re not welcome. And at the heart of it, I think that’s what this is about. This isn’t about some security argument or even some of the promises on the campaign trail. It’s this idea of changing America’s demographics because of this nationalism.
Factual analyses have dismantled this false narrative put forth by some in the mainstream media. While Trump’s efforts include a strengthening of American nationalism, he recognizes that immigration has played a key role in American history and he supports immigration through a legal means. The type of nationalism Trump envisions is not based on culture or ethnicity. In fact, Trump has rejected cultural or ethnic nationalism and has instead opted for a nationalism based on shared political ideals epitomized by the Constitution and the land those laws apply to.
The panel discussion, titled “Trump’s Ban 2.0: Justified or Discriminatory” also included David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity; Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law; and Barbara Slavin, who is the director of the Atlantic Council’s Future of Iran Initiative.
All of them were vocally against Trump’s executive order.
“Your risk of being killed by a refugee over the last 40-year period is one in 3.6 billion,” Bier said. “I would note that, furthermore, you don’t need to ban certain countries or certain nationalities to enforce screening procedures in the United States.”
Frost argued that while the temporary ban “violated the due process rights of the people who were affected,” the revised version of the ban, put in place March 6, is “from a due process perspective, much more acceptable.” She attempted to frame the temporary visa ban as a Muslim ban, using “context” from several statements Trump had made while he was still a candidate to make this claim.
However, the executive order is not a Muslim ban. The first order did not mention Islam or any other religion. However, the second order mentions Islam. Specifically, the word “Islam” is explicitly mentioned to note that the ban is not a Muslim ban. It reads:
While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities — whoever they are and wherever they reside — to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.
Indonesia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia – the largest Muslim countries in the world – are not included in the 90-day ban. The seven nations initially named in the first version of the executive order were drawn from President Barack Obama’s Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015.
One of the primary goals of the Trump administration’s temporary ban is to push for greater information sharing between the United States and Middle Eastern nations whose nationals are seeking visas to enter the United States. The order is a direct reaction to the rise in Muslim-led extremism throughout much of the Western world. Iran appears on the list due to its status as one of the leading abusers of human rights and sponsors of terrorism in the world.
The White House offered a brief description of Iran, taken in part from the Department of State’s Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016):
Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa’ida and has permitted al-Qa’ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.
NIAC is suing the Trump administration over the temporary ban along with three other groups: the Iranian-American Bar Association, the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) and the PARS Equality Center.
“We are, indeed, continuing our legal efforts,” Abdi said. He added the second draft of the executive order weakened their legal claims but suggested, “we still have plenty, plenty of instances” and “the cases actually keep growing.”
He also suggested the ban on Iran would become permanent. “It is in the text of the ban that there is envisioned to be a permanent ban,” he said. He added, “additional countries may be added to the list.” Iraq was removed from the list, which he said was a result of the Iraqi government lobbying the Trump administration.
In the newly-revised version of Trump’s executive order, the White House notes, “In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal.” It is not clear whether Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen have agreed to similar arrangements.
Abdi said of Iraq’s removal from the list, “We don’t foresee that same type of connection happening between Iran and any Trump officials. At least, not as far as we know.”
At the end of the panel, Breitbart News asked Slavin if she had spoken with any Iranians who supported the temporary visa ban. “Apart from Saghar, who always comes to my events and says something about the Islamic Republic and how bad they are, no. Because it hurts ordinary people.”
During the questions and answers segment, a concerned Iranian-American activist Saghar Kasraei asked, “why are we supporting the Islamic Republic of Iran right now?” She suggested the focus of conversation should, instead, be on “a genocide of the Syrian people right now because of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
Echoing NIAC’s Abdi, Slavin told Breitbart News, “this thing is just a propaganda gift to the regime. I don’t see how anyone in their right minds would support it.”
The majority of individuals who support Iran’s inclusion on the temporary ban say they do so on the basis that the regime is the world’s leading exporter of terrorism, particularly throughout the Middle East, Latin and Central America.
Hossein Khorram, an Iranian-American who “escaped tyranny like most of the 1 million Iranians who came to the United States,” is one of these people. He told Breitbart News he supports Iran’s placement on Trump’s executive order.
Khorram is a Republican activist and a former Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention. He told Breitbart News, “Trump won on the promise to strengthen the security of the American people” and “the Iranian regime poses an existential threat to the United States because they have been able to reach and penetrate the other five nations listed on the temporary ban. They have already dominated their own people, and they are now using the vehicle of terror to carry out the domination of surrounding countries using the nuclear option to carry this forward.”
He extended his criticism to NIAC, which he said “does not represent this community of Iranian expats. They have not reached out to serve the needs of this community. They haven’t tried to reach out to our community. They instead reach to those who think about normalizing relation between the United States and Iran.” He added that the regime has “violated the rights of women, minorities, and children and has blood on their hands.”
Khorram added, “I would say more than 95 percent of Iranian-Americans feel the same way as I do. This group is getting paid to serve a particular agenda. This agenda is serving the Iranian regime’s needs. It’s helping the regime survive. And the only people who don’t know this are the people on Capitol Hill and those in the Iranian government. They have an agenda and their agenda is not an American agenda, unfortunately.”

"For the latest grisly example of hypocrisy, “progressive” cronyism, feminist cry-bullying, and Deep State entrenchment, look no further than Britain’s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies.",https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/10/britains-nanny-state-is-out-of-control/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,73.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"For the latest grisly example of hypocrisy, “progressive” cronyism, feminist cry-bullying, and Deep State entrenchment, look no further than Britain’s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies.
Davies is the embodiment of Nanny State meddling. So much so that only last December, she proudly referred to herself — for these jumped up bureaucrats have no shame — as the nation’s “chief nanny.”
This was in the context of swingeing demands she’d made — perfectly timed to ruin everyone’s Christmas — for more taxes on sugary soft drinks, on milky drinks, and on foods high in salt. The Nanny State in excelsis, waging war on people’s private pleasures and freedoms.
The “chief nanny” has form. In 2016, she declared that there is no safe limit on the amount of alcohol that can be drunk. She urged women “to do as I do and think about the risk of cancer before having a glass of wine.”
So how bizarre it was to hear this same woman on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this week berating her interviewer Nick Robinson for “sexism” because he had used the word “nannying” to describe what she does.
According to the Mail:
Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies chastised BBC Radio 4 presenter Nick Robinson after he used the term “nannying” during an interview with her this morning. Clearly offended by the remark, the professor, who was on the show to discuss how much screen time is recommended by the government for children, said: “I wonder whether you would say that to a male Chief Medical Officer.” On social media, some listeners of the Today programme said Dame Sally was right to pull up Robinson on his choice of words, with many accusing him of being “sexist”.
Two things need to be said on this point.
The first is that, yes, actually Robinson would almost certainly have used the term “nannying” for a male Chief Medical Officer as freely as for a female one. As Tim Worstall notes, Davies’s predecessor Sir Liam Donaldson was often given the “nannying” tag.
The second and more important one is: “What IS this woman like?” I mean, seriously. To call yourself “chief nanny” and then, only two months later, to feign hurt and victimhood when someone describes you using the same term smacks of the rankest hypocrisy and the most outrageous chutzpah.
And yet she seems to have got away with it. I’ve read not a single article in the mainstream media calling her out on her ugly, devious, cry-bullying behaviour. Here is a powerful, senior public servant on a salary in excess of £200,000 blatantly playing the sexism card in order to avoid being held accountable by the public she is supposed to serve. There was nothing unreasonable or rude about Robinson’s question, which was couched cautiously and somewhat nervously. Davies did the dirty on him. No BBC interviewer wants to be accused of “sexism” in this age of the (pretend) gender pay gap and of post #MeToo hysteria. It was a low down devious trick to shut down the debate and it worked.
According to a report last year by the Taxpayers’ Alliance, there are now 266 public health officials on salaries in excess of £100,000, all funded by you, the taxpayer.
The ten best-paid ones — including Sally Davies — are on salaries in excess of £200,000, more than the Prime Minister earns.
So what do we, the public, get in return for all our largesse to these bansturbatory control freaks?
More rules, more regulations, higher prices, more restrictions on what used to be known as “lifestyle choices”. (Increasingly, it seems that the State wants to do all the choosing for us).
At best these rules are intrusive and pointless; at worst, counterproductive or otherwise damaging.
For example, all “plain” packaging has done — apart from making cigarette packets unspeakably ugly and killing one of the advertising industry’s more creative lines — is to fuel the black market. If there has been any reduction in smoking it has been largely the result of the thing public health officials most loathe and fear: the free market. The development of vaping has done far, far more to wean smokers off tobacco than anything the likes of Sally Davies have done in their meddling careers.
Then there’s another of my bugbears, the sugar tax pushed by Jamie Oliver and implemented by Davos Man Chancellor George Osborne. What did it achieve? Mainly, it destroyed the taste of classic fizzy drinks Lucozade, Irn Bru, and San Pellegrino — all of which disastrously altered their formulae in a misguided attempt to avoid commercial damage to their product.
But the story gets worse. Much worse.
Dame Sally Davies has a new job. And guess what it is?
Why, she has only gone and been appointed Master of the grandest college at Cambridge University.
Gosh. What possible reason could it be that this drearily right on, female quangocrat, no doubt instilled in the progressive values of Common Purpose, got the plummest of plum jobs in academe?
Was it her intellectual prowess? Was it the conversational skills and charm which will no doubt make the hours fly by for everyone sitting next to her at High Table formal dinners?
I doubt it somehow, really I do. But hey, what would I know? I’m just one of those reactionary sexist pigs who thinks that if Oxbridge is to retain its credibility as the apogee of higher education, it really needs to appoint the very brightest and the best, regardless of their politics or gender.","['Deep', 'State', 'entrenchment', 'progressive', 'cronyism', 'feminist', 'cry-bullying', 'hypocrisy', 'grisly']"
An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/22/democrats-block-senate-coronavirus-package/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,73.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would provide economic relief to businesses and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Senate GOP package failed, with 47 votes in favor and 47 against, which fell 13 votes short of what was necessary to advance the legislation.
An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package.
“I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” the Senate leader said on Sunday.
McConnell added that there was bipartisan consensus among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.”
“She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” he added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.”
In contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blamed Republicans for advancing legislation without an agreement.
Schumer said on the Senate floor:
The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing. So who’s playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we’re committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee slammed Senate Democrats for blocking the legislation.
NRSC Communications Director said in a statement on Sunday:
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats allowed partisan fervor to thwart a critical coronavirus relief package while our country faces a crippling pandemic. DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren’t beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats’ unthinkable decision to filibuster.
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said in a statement on Sunday:
‪How pathetic. Tonight’s vote was not even on passing a bipartisan plan, it was merely to begin debating it. The American people are hurting, the clock is ticking, but Senate Democrats would rather cave to Speaker Pelosi’s eleventh-hour demands. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should worry more about getting relief to their constituents and less about the House Speaker’s partisan wish list. This cannot go another day.
After congressional Republicans and Democrats were in the final stages of negotiating a long-term coronavirus package deal with the White House, Pelosi announced that House Democrats will move forward with their own bill.
“From my standpoint, we’re apart,” she said earlier on Sunday.

Angry Democrats blamed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care. ,https://www.breitbart.com/news/outraged-democrats-vow-to-challenge-court-ruling-undercutting-obamacare/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,73.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Washington (AFP) – Outraged Democrats vowed to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that could undo the US health care law known as Obamacare, saying on Saturday that they will use their new power in Congress to hold Republicans responsible and “expose their lies.”
US District Judge Reed O’Connor ruled Friday that the health care law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is unconstitutional.
The White House said it expects the ruling to be appealed to the Supreme Court. For now, it said in a statement, “the law remains in place.”
But Democrats, who have seen the law survive scores of legal and legislative attacks, vowed to fight back, saying health coverage of millions of Americans is at stake.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Republicans had pretended to care about those protected by Obamacare “while quietly trying to remove that support in the courts. Next year, we will force votes to expose their lies.”
Democrats see the law as a signature achievement of former president Barack Obama, while Republicans dismiss it as governmental overreach. Donald Trump made abolishing and replacing the program a central pledge of his presidential campaign.
In a separate Obamacare case in 2012, five justices in the nine-judge Supreme Court upheld the law. All five remain on the court.
Still, it remains unclear how they might rule in the new case which, if left to stand, has the potential for enormous disruption to the US health care system.
In his ruling Friday, the Texas-based judge said that the full Obamacare program was unconstitutional because Congress, in its 2017 tax overhaul, eliminated a penalty for anyone lacking health insurance who failed to sign up for the program.
The 2012 case was over whether such a penalty was legal — but now that it is gone, O’Connor said, the whole ACA should be stricken down because that provision is “the keystone” of the program.
Trump lost no time in tweeting his delight at the court’s ruling on a complaint brought by several Republican attorneys general and two Republican governors.
“Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
“As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster!” he said.
Trump urged the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the House of Representatives speaker-designate, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, to “pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare.”
– ‘Monstrous endgame’ –
The court ruling came on the eve of the deadline for people to sign up for ACA coverage for 2019.
Angry Democrats blamed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care.
Republicans “know that they can’t repeal the ACA in Congress. So they’ve continued their crusade through the courts,” tweeted Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a consumer-protection activist. “The ACA is still the law of the land.”
Polls consistently show strong public support for the ACA guarantee of coverage regardless of pre-existing health conditions — an issue Democrats used with great success in last month’s midterm elections as they won control of the House of Representatives.
“#Republicans’ legal crusade against the #AffordableCareAct is a political stunt, but a dangerous one that puts health coverage and vital health protections for millions of Americans at risk,” Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tweeted Saturday.
“They found one judge to agree, and now Medicaid expansion could be gone, pre-existing condition protections could be wiped out, prices skyrocket and millions lose insurance. And they call that success,” Democratic congressman Joe Kennedy wrote on the social media site.
O’Connor’s late Friday ruling “exposes the monstrous endgame of Republicans’ all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans’ access to affordable health care,” Pelosi said in a statement.
While the court’s “absurd ruling will be immediately appealed, Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision,” she said.
She vowed that when Democrats take control of the House in January, lawmakers “will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process” to uphold Obamacare.
Opposing the Republican lawsuit were 17 Democratic attorneys general led by Xavier Becerra of California.
They argue that the tax law changes do not mean that the whole Affordable Care Act becomes unconstitutional.
The Texas ruling “is an assault on 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions” and on all who rely on Obamacare coverage, Becerra said in a statement. “Our fight to save Obamacare is far from over,” he tweeted.","['Angry', 'debacle']"
"A group of 20 wealthy individuals – including left-wing financier George Soros – signed a letter Monday, begging for a wealth tax and arguing that the U.S has a “moral, ethical, and economic responsibility” to tax wealthy individuals more.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/06/24/soros-linked-group-of-wealthy-individuals-pen-letter-begging-for-a-moderate-wealth-tax/,breitbart,middle-class,right,73.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A group of 20 wealthy individuals – including left-wing financier George Soros – signed a letter Monday, begging for a wealth tax and arguing that the U.S has a “moral, ethical, and economic responsibility” to tax wealthy individuals more.
Although the letter is framed as a nonpartisan plea, it is linked to Soros and speaks highly of proposals put forth by Democrat candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
The signers call for “a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1 percent of Americans — on us.”
The signers argue that the “moderate wealth tax” could help solve a plethora of issues. It could, they say, “address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms.”
In addition to better rules on carbon pollution, more American investment is needed now to tackle climate change. This could both accelerate innovation and speed implementation of solutions that create a clean energy economy and a low-carbon future. A wealth tax asks those of us who have benefitted most from our economic system to help fix one of its most devastating and fatal flaws.
The letter also characterizes the proposed tax as “patriotic.”
In our republic, it is the patriotic duty of all Americans to contribute what they can to the success of the country, and the wealthiest are no exception. Others have put far more on the line for America. Those of us in the richest 1/10 of the richest 1% should be proudto payabit more of our fortune forward to America’s future. We’ll be fine—taking onthis tax is the least we can do to strengthen the country we love.
The letter is signed by Soros, as well as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and others including: Louise J. Bowditch, Robert S. Bowditch, Abigail Disney, Sean Eldridge, Stephen R. English, Agnes Gund, Catherine Gund, Nick Hanauer, Arnold Hiatt, Molly Munger, Regan Pritzker, Justin Rosenstein, Stephen M.Silberstein, Ian T. Simmons, Liesel Pritzker Simmons, and Alexander Soros.
“We thought it would be a good idea,” Blue Haven Initiative co-founder Ian Simmons said, according to the New York Times. “Liesel and I decided to reach out to some other folks to see if they thought it was a good idea, too.”
While signers claim the letter “does not represent an endorsement of any presidential candidate,” it specifically references Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg (D), and Beto O’Rourke, seemingly pushing for and endorsing their various versions of a wealth tax.
The letter states:
Several candidates for President, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, MayorPete Buttigieg, and Representative Beto O’Rourke, are already supportive of the idea. The first specific candidate proposal, introduced by Senator Warren, would provide millions of families with a better shot at the American dream by taxing only 75,000 of the wealthiest families in the country.” The proposal is straightforward: It puts in place a tax of 2 cents on the dollar on assets after a $50 million exemption and an additional tax of 1 cent on the dollar on assets over $1 billion. If you have $49.9 million or less you are not paying the tax. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over ten years.”
There is currently no law barring wealthy individuals from voluntarily paying more in taxes.","['left-wing', 'begging']"
"It is also worth noting that the “white nationalist” in question, Patrick Casey, does not claim to be a white nationalist but an identitarian activist, a group the far-left media regularly attack as racist.",https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/11/08/daily-beast-spreads-fake-news-white-nationalist-guest-white-house/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,73.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The far-left Daily Beast spread the fake news Wednesday that a “white nationalist” had been a guest at the White House.
After informing readers that the leader of “a white nationalist group … visited the White House on Wednesday,” the Daily Beast’s Asawin Suebsaeng and Will Sommer then claimed he had been a White House guest.
According to the Beast’s “three sources,” who are supposedly “familiar with how the Trump White House operates,” readers are told that the only way this white nationalist could have had his picture taken “directly in front of the White House’s south front” is if he had been “escorted by a Trump administration staffer wearing an official badge to get that kind of access.”
In other words, the only way this person could have been where he was is if he were an official guest at the White House.
Other than the fact that none of the above is even close to the truth and that the entire premise of the article is the fakest of fake news, the Daily Beast has a real bombshell on its hands.
The truth is that there was a Fall Garden Tour that allowed “more than twenty-five thousand people” access to this area of the White House, deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters told the Daily Beast in an email.
She added that this tour “is open to the public. Free tickets are made available to anyone who wants to attend.”
And here is where things get especially interesting….
In the original article, the Daily Beast reported that this “white nationalist” leader visited the White House on Wednesday. But here is the thing…
The Daily Beast had no idea when he visited, which is something these so-called reporters are forced to admit in their stealth rewrite of the original article.
Original story: “The leader of a white nationalist group whose members marched in the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville visited the White House on Wednesday, according to pictures he posted online.”
Stealth rewrite: “Though [the white nationalist’s] post was dated Wednesday, Walters’ explanation suggests that he visited the White House on either October 20 or 21, when the Fall Garden Tour was held.”
So based only on the date the photo was posted, without knowing if it were true, the Daily Beast told its readers that date was also the date of the visit, which, of course, fit a false narrative about triumphant racists celebrating Tuesday’s election results as guests of the White House.
Worse still…
Rather than do the correct thing–rather than issue a correction or retract the fake news–the article was stealthily edited with a massive rewrite. (You can compare the before and after here and here.)
At the bottom of the rewrite, an editor’s note reads, “This article has been updated with additional reporting,” which is not even close to true. The truth is that all of the fake news was secretly retracted and the article rewritten almost entirely.
It is also worth noting that the “white nationalist” in question, Patrick Casey, does not claim to be a white nationalist but an identitarian activist, a group the far-left media regularly attack as racist.
Finally, Will Sommer, the co-writer of this fake news deception and the subsequent cover-up, makes a living smearing right-leaning journalists as racists and liars, all in the hope of having them de-platformed, censored, and silenced. And if that means publishing this kind of fake news and then covering up his lies with a secret rewrite, so be it.

Rowe posted on Facebook Tuesday a comment written to him:
One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitests. Comment? No? I’m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don’t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country – promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin’ our ass academically.
“Since we’re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post,” Rowe fired back. “Everything about it annoys me –your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position.”
Rowe then dismantled each of Atkins’ unsubstantiated points. He lambasted celebrities for constantly broadcasting their political opinions as though their views have any impact on most Americans:
I’m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it’s “bad for business,” but because it’s annoying. I can’t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I’m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine.
He then criticized the attempt to lump Republicans and white nationalists into the same group:
You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an “academic elite.” You then say that Republicans promote “anti-intellectualism.” You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn’t matter – your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief. Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common – a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans “love” me because they believe that my initiative and “their” initiative are one and the same. But of course, “their” initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you’ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things “intellectual.” And poof – just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I’m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis!
Rowe goes on to argue that millions of people across the political divide have concerns about the state of higher education, noting that universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world:
Millions of reasonable people – Republicans and Democrats alike – are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They’re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities – once beacons of free speech – now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can’t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they’re concerned – deeply concerned – that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don’t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it.
“In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn’t care less. My question is, why do you?” Rowe finished.","['unsubstantiated', 'lambasted']"

A piece published by the New York Times this week reflects on the tragic white nationalist rally that took place in Charlottesville last year. The piece primarily focuses on the failure of white nationalists to stage a similar event this year. Just a handful of attendees showed up at a planned follow-up event that took place over the weekend in Washington D.C.
While the piece fairly analyzes the fracturing of the white nationalist movement, it makes the bizarre claim that ideas that are widely popular amongst mainstream conservatives, such as ending affirmative action, are actually white nationalist in origin.
“But some experts on white nationalism say the movement’s political agenda remains disconcertingly widespread,” the piece reads. “And some policy issues the far right has promoted, including immigration restrictions, ending affirmative action and instituting trade protections, have been embraced by mainstream right-wing politicians and pundits.”
To the thinking person, the claim doesn’t make sense. How could this be a new phenomenon adopted from the small white nationalist movement when mainstream conservatives have been fighting to end affirmative action for decades?
Conservative author and economist Thomas Sowell has been arguing against affirmative action for decades. Economist Milton Friedman argued against it in the 1980s. President George W. Bush argued against it in the early 2000s.
Users on Twitter quickly pointed out the absurdity of this claim.
.@nytimes claims that ending affirmative action is a ""white nationalist"" idea that has been ""embraced"" by the mainstream right. Really? Prominent black intellectuals like Bayard Rustin and Zora Neale Hurston were opposing racial preferences decades ago. https://t.co/7qhWao8UKx — Coleman Hughes (@coldxman) August 14, 2018
Breitbart News has extensively written about affirmative action. Most recently, coverage has focused on a pending lawsuit against Harvard University filed by an activist group which claims that the Ivy League school’s admission’s practices are biased against Asian applicants.
Thoughtful critics of affirmative action have pointed out that race-based admissions policies are vulnerable to perpetuating specific injustices. For example, the children of a wealthy black entrepreneur may be favored over the white children of absent or abusive parents. A truly holistic admissions approach might allow admissions officers to take race into the equation only when it is demonstrated that race-based discrimination posed a significant barrier to the applicant’s life, if at all.","['thinking', 'white', 'nationalist']"

BJP denied it had instigated the clashes and claimed without evidence that the attack was started by the left-leaning students.
JNU is one of India's most prestigious universities and has a history of left-wing activism. Many of the students have protested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP in recent years and have accused them of trying to stomp out free speech.
Following Sunday's attack, videos of violence spread quickly over WhatsApp and were broadcast on television, sparking similar protests in Chandigarh, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Hyderabad.
In Kolkata, the scene at Jadavpur University took a disturbing turn as a video showed police forcibly going after nearly 100 students and BJP workers with their iron batons.
The deputy commissioner of Kolkata Police eventually apologized for the bloodying of students - many of whom were women - and argued that tensions had risen too quickly. After blocking their path for nearly two hours, the students eventually marched on to the local police station to file a complaint against the officers who had beaten the female students.

And the message from this trouncing is clear: the American people are tired of the status quo, of business as usual.
So while these Republicans in D.C. are still lost in the mindset that voters will still support them because ""they're not the other guys,"" that's not entirely true: promises were made, tens of millions of dollars were raised off said promises. Time to man up, Republicans, and fulfill those promises or else people might call you for what you're acting like right now: liars.
However, some, seemingly because they lack the courage to do what they said they were going to do, are retiring. I call them the Binky Brigade. As in whining and crying about how that mean big, bad man in the White House is saying hurtful things about them. Memo to the Binky Brigade: this is politics. It's a full contact sport, a blood sport.
It's the battleground of ideas. And why are you worried about Trump saying ""mean"" things about you on Twitter when you should be damn well concerned about your constituents who are going to either vote for you, or not.

Elected Republicans had better prepare for primary challengers from the right, just like the Tea Party candidates in 2010. The same forces that sent conservatives to Congress in waves are ready and waiting to remove the members of Congress that refuse to do what they promised.
As Sen. Flake saw in the polls, throw in with the Democrats against the president at your own risk. And by the way, if some had spent the last ten months passing meaningful legislation instead of hand-wringing on Morning Joe and selling your anti-Trump retirement book, or taking an unwarranted August recess, maybe there would be fewer tweets to complain about.
Unfortunately, too many Republicans in Congress are spending more time preparing to respond to tweets than they are to passing legislation. These 17 minute speeches, like Flake’s on Tuesday, don’t come out of nowhere. Flake has been planning his grandstanding on the Senate floor more than he’s been planning to pass legislation the president can pass to address ObamaCare, tax reform, infrastructure, or the myriad of other problems facing our country.
While Flake’s audience ate up every moment of this speech, who really cares? His approval rating is at 18 percent, as in most of the Phoenix phone book has a higher approval rating than he does. Sadly, Flake was preaching to the liberal choir in the Acela corridor, not his voters out in Arizona.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
She casually spotlighted her revolutionary rejection of biology, sex, and the male-or-female society during a live Facebook chat in which she was asked about her views on the military draft. “As long as we have a draft, I support people of all genders being drafted,” she said.
Male and female are the two sexes — but transgender advocates now claim more than 50 “genders” — including agender, bigender, gender fluid, gender non-conforming, genderqueer, intersex, two-spirit, etc, plus “cis-gender” for the 99+ percent of people who are normal, non-transgender people

This rejection of male-and-female society — including singles, parents, and children — is now the norm in the new Democratic Party, which has embraced the transgender ideology.
That ideology says each persons’ preferences are — and should be — unconnected from their bodies. It says that men and women are interchangeable, and can switch their sex by switching their own sense of “gender identity” so that men who say they are women really do become biological women, complete with female penises.
Also, progressives want the government to clear away the “social construction” — laws and civic norms — which supposedly prevent small women from wrestling large men to the ground, and which deter large men in tutus from trying to Jette far above tall female dancers.
For Democrats, this wave or new regulation, censorship, and civic pressure will free the less-than-one-percent of people who say they are transgender from the oppressive, outdated rules of male-dominated supremacy. People will discard the oppressive “gender binary” of male or female sexes and will embrace the freedom of new “genders” — transgender, bi-gender, non-conforming, etc, etc, etc., progressives say.

In contrast, conservatives say that men and women are legally equal, but their bodies give them different and complementary skills, abilities, and preferences. For example, conservatives point out that men tend to be stronger and will aggressively compete against other men to support their wives and children, while women have the remarkable ability to grow babies and moderate male aggression. Teenage boys and girls also compete and cooperate among themselves in their very different ways, while also finding much time to cooperate across the sexual divide.
Conservatives also point out that transgenderism requires intense government regulation of society to prevent women from ejecting men from their showers and bathrooms, to stop girls complaining when teenage boys run away with the sports titles, and to block female students when scholarships for women go to men.
Rep. Jayapal (and nearly all Dems.) feels Congress must tightly regulate all 330M Americans to ensure ""freedom"" for the less-than-1% of people who wish to switch their sex. But the imp. news is that GOP Leaders have begun opposing the transgender ideology. https://t.co/o80TXo9xzR — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) April 4, 2019
Democrats are fast discarding this ancient understanding of the two sexes.
On March 28, for example, nearly all House Democrats — including Ocasio-Cortez — backed a resolution calling on the Pentagon to recruit “transgender” people who openly insist they are members of the opposite sex.
Whereas President Trump’s ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces would affect all transgender members of the Armed Forces and force them to serve under a policy that stigmatizes and devalues their contributions to our Nation’s defense: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That at the House of Representatives— (1) strongly opposes President Trump’s discriminatory ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces; (2) rejects the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based; and (3) strongly urges the Department of Defense to not reinstate President Trump’s ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces and to maintain an inclusive policy allowing qualified transgender Americans to enlist and serve in the Armed Forces.
Only one Republican denounced the contents of the resolution, Missouri Rep. Vickey Hartzler.
In contrast, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and other Democrats lashed at the GOP. The Pentagon’s decision to define soldiers’ sex by their biology “is an act of cruelty … [and] bigoted,” said Pelosi. It “violates every value of American democracy … [it]would undermine our military readiness … [it is] prejudice, not patriotism … We will never allow hate and prejudice to dictate our national security,” Pelosi said.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama told National Public Radio that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are members of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by his feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, as well as progressives, plus feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women’s rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In February, for example, an Ohio judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she could begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that would allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K–12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in child-rearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.","['revolutionary', 'casually']"
"Moynihan never described the specific spiritual benefits that would arise from the kind of cutbacks needed to solve a future government debt crisis. But in explaining how excessive public spending undermines traditional values, he was clearly suggesting subsequent belt-tightening could have the reverse effect.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/16/how-americas-looming-debt-crisis-could-spark-the-next-great-awakening/,federalist,student-debt,right,74.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"To say America appears headed for a destabilizing debt crisis is not the same as saying every cultural consequence will be negative. It could well lead to a mass religious revival.
The total of U.S. federal, state, and local debt, in combination with future spending commitments, foreshadows the most predictable financial disaster in human history. Washington’s obligations, growing at an estimated $1 trillion annually, now exceed $23 trillion, while neither of America’s two largest entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, are on sound footing.
Going down to the state and local levels, a May 2018 report by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government reveals that public pension funding in New Jersey and Kentucky is already at “high risk of insolvency,” with California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and several large cities close behind. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, at least 20 state public pension programs have no more than half the assets they need to pay promised benefits.
Ominous trends, to be sure. Yet to say America appears headed for a destabilizing debt crisis is not the same as saying every cultural consequence will be negative. History records many economic and social upheavals that ironically sparked a renaissance of neglected moral and spiritual values. Could our approaching brush with national insolvency really produce anything like a religious revival? There are admittedly good reasons to be skeptical.
Secularism has become so prevalent in the United States, especially within academic communities, it’s hard to imagine it ever dissipating. Mainline religious denominations have long been in retreat, with the percentage of self-described Protestants down from 51 percent to 43 percent in just the last decade and of Catholics from 23 percent to 20 percent over the same period. There also do not appear to be any contemporary theologians capable of doing what charismatic evangelists, such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, accomplished during the Great Awakening revivals of the 1730s and 1740s.
Yet the statistics on declining church attendance are too often confused with the number of believers. For while the percentage of Americans who claim no religious affiliation has jumped to 26 percent from 17 percent since 2009, more than half of these so-called nones say they still believe in God. Noting that outright atheists and agnostics make up only 9 percent of the U.S. population, Baylor University’s distinguished professor of history Philip Jenkins cautions against equating “no religious affiliation” with “no religious belief” or with the capacity of organized religion to reform and regenerate.
Fewer Government Programs Aids Character Development
If, indeed, the cultural pendulum, which has always swung between established faith and institutional skepticism, is more susceptible to a reversal than generally supposed, aspects of the debt crisis could both hasten and magnify the turn.
The first was anticipated nearly 35 years ago by Democratic New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in an address to St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Rochester, New York. Public borrowing, he warned the congregation, differs from private borrowing in a fundamental way: The government officials “who do the borrowing … are not the ones who will do the repaying.” As a result, they are tempted to use debt “not as a form of investment [in the country’s future],” but to buy votes from the beneficiaries of new programs.
At the time, Moynihan was primarily concerned that irresponsible politicians promising their constituents an insupportable array of handouts would jeopardize America’s economic well-being. But he also worried that the more government tries to provide for citizens’ material needs, the more it undermines the public’s faith in character development and in serving some idea of God. Instead of validating the precepts common to all religions, he warned, debt-fueled public spending “can, and frequently does, [promote] just the opposite.”
Moynihan never described the specific spiritual benefits that would arise from the kind of cutbacks needed to solve a future government debt crisis. But in explaining how excessive public spending undermines traditional values, he was clearly suggesting subsequent belt-tightening could have the reverse effect.
Debt Downfall May Encourage Traditional Religious Beliefs
A more recent study by Connecticut hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, for his book “Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises,” suggests a second spiritual effect of the coming debt crisis. After closely examining every recovery from the brink of a sovereign bankruptcy since ancient Greece, Dalio concluded all successful government bailouts have one necessary characteristic: The various social factions within the distressed country, from wealthy taxpayers to recipients of entitlement programs to public workers, must agree to put aside long-standing differences and share in the rescue. Not because the factions think their own sacrifice fair, but because dividing the financial pain is the only way to stop their habitual squabbling from morphing into a catastrophic civil war.
The implication for resolving our fiscal crisis is that the energies which today we so relentlessly focus on defeating perceived political enemies — be they progressives or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans, government bureaucrats or wealthy corporate executives — will eventually have to be redirected toward a stoic acceptance of mutual forfeiture. For many, this will mean being reconciled to higher taxes. For others, it will mean smaller government benefit checks, reduced public pension payouts, higher interest rates, reduced subsidies, or some combination of these.
This mutual acceptance of reduced economic expectation may not lead to a mass outbreak of “loving thy neighbor as thyself,” but it will require culturally elevating many traditionally religious beliefs: that people should be at their best when times are bad, that no one escapes a worldly trial, and that human institutions are never to be fully trusted. The spiritual wisdom of biblical figures who suffered unfairly — Joseph sold into slavery by his own brothers, Daniel locked in the lion’s den, and the Apostle Paul thrown into the late-night ocean — will likely have a much wider appeal.
Religion will also prove more attractive in a practical way. One of the underreported stories of the 2007-2008 financial crisis was the critical role various churches played in helping people cope with the abrupt collapse of home values, the big drop in retirement savings due to falling stock prices, and the subsequent tsunami of pink slips and salary cuts. Not only did every major denomination offer free classes on how better to handle money, but a February 2009 Lifeway Research survey of 1,000 American churches found that one-third had instituted or expanded food banks, employment bureaus, inexpensive medical services, or low-cost after-school programs for parishioners’ children.
A Better Public Education For a Third of the Price
A third spiritual consequence of the coming debt crisis will be the pressure it creates to lower the cost of local governments’ biggest expense, K-12 education, by subsidizing children to attend parochial schools. Although the argument for such a policy has traditionally been based on the superior academic quality of many religious schools, especially in big cities, the economic case is also remarkably compelling. In Hartford, Connecticut, for example, the per-pupil cost of a public elementary or middle-school placement is more than six times that of the average Christian or Hebrew school.
Of course, subsidizing families to voluntarily elect a religious education for their children would probably do little to advance religion if nonbelieving parents had no interest in the option. But research conducted by Christel J. Manning, a professor at Sacred Heart University, found that many adults who have stopped attending church or have rejected a belief in God still see religious schools as a better defender of the values they hold than typical public schools.
Grateful for any help they can get to counter mass media influence and student peer pressure, many such parents gladly elect a parochial placement for their child if a district or state policy subsidizes the option.
The Debt Crisis Raises Suspicions of Secularism
The final way in which the coming debt crisis will advance religion is by creating a terminal suspicion of what the philosopher Max Weber long ago recognized as secularism’s biggest selling point: the supposed ability to replace spiritual conceptions of reality with scientific laws powerful enough to improve not just the manufacturing of consumer goods, but society’s organization. “The fate of our times,” Weber famously wrote, is to be persuaded “by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world.”
Even though a century of government social engineering has consistently failed to deliver on secular promises to end poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, and many other problems — as Amity Shlaes documents so well in her new book “Great Society” — the belief in scientifically guided policymaking endures. All that is required to make its programs successful, the thinking goes, is more generous funding.
But how well can this argument hold up when there is no more money to spend? In other words, if what it takes to make social engineering effective exceeds what it takes to push a federal, state, or local government to the edge of bankruptcy, how is a secular culture any better than one relying on the moral and spiritual development of its people?
As the debt crisis unfolds, the idea of allowing social science to drive public policy, even if it were somehow affordable, will prove increasingly objectionable. For as Americans are already learning, many government programs are based on grossly misleading academic research, conducted by professors more interested in pleasing funders and colleagues than in getting to truth.
Are We on the Path to a Great Awakening?
So tenuous is today’s secular worldview, in fact, that the vast majority of supposedly “settled discoveries” in psychology, politics, anthropology, sociology, and even medicine cannot be replicated. “Most published research findings [in these areas] are false,” says John Ioannidis, co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford University.
Thus far, the consequences of what appears to be an astonishingly fictionalized reality have been mostly limited to conferences on how to salvage the academy’s tarnished reputation. But how will the public take to the idea of social engineering — and, more importantly, to the secular assumptions on which it is based — as the bill incurred for decades of fraudulently justified government regulation comes due? When science’s irreproducibility crisis meets the government debt crisis, must there not be a third crisis about the nature of conventionally accepted reality?
The effects of government belt-tightening on beneficiary values, the need for shared sacrifice, a resurgence of religious schooling, the economic limitation on social engineering, and the deeper unreliability of the pseudo-science upon which that engineering is based — will the combined consequences of America’s looming debt crisis be enough to spark its next Great Awakening? This is not a question we can answer until it happens, but neither is the prospect as far-fetched as it initially sounds.",[]

Last week, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy released a three-minute video in which he vigorously ranted against the ongoing lockdowns. Portnoy’s basic point was that the goalposts have shifted from “flatten the curve” to “find a cure.” He pointed out, in blunt and colorful language, that economic suicide in pursuit of the latter goal is insanity. His video went viral.
Portnoy is not a political figure. His anger over the economic crisis and sense that, having done our best to slow the spread, we have the right to take a risk to survive, resonates with a lot of normal people.
One of Portnoy’s repeated questions throughout the video was, “When did this happen?” When did we go from flattening the curve to tanking our economy, our livelihoods, and our futures? (Language warning in the video below.)
Last night on Tucker Carlson, Andrew Napolitano offered a related reflection when he described a free state as “one where the laws are written to uphold personal liberties,” while the definition of a police state is “one where the laws are written, legitimately or not, to uphold what the government wants.” He went on to note that there has been a transition in America that has not been gradual: “In a period of six weeks we have gone from a free state . . . to a police state.”
Alarming as it is, Napolitano is right. While COVID-19 is an obviously serious and frightening virus, our leaders (and many fellow Americans) seem oblivious to the destruction we are self-inflicting on our economy and on millions of American lives.
The bureaucrats and local would-be dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent. So how did we get here, and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive?
We got here because, as a nation, we agreed to the lockdowns in the first place. In late March and early April, as the virus was spreading in densely populated American cities and horror stories were pouring out of Lombardy, Italy, the mood among Americans shifted. Lockdowns started in coastal states where the threat felt most immediate, and swept the nation shortly thereafter.
The lockdowns happened because the national mood favored the lockdowns. Politicians knew they could call on their emergency powers and impose the restrictions because they would not meet resistance. Collectively, we consented.
Do not underestimate the power of a national mood. Wars have been won and lost based not on the military might of a nation so much as the will of its people to either prevail or to fold.
Nowhere is the spirit of a people more a force to be reckoned with than in America, where freedom and individual autonomy are part of our DNA. This invisible force is a very real influence in politics, and many constitutional abuses have never been attempted over the years, not because they were unconstitutional, but because politicians and leaders understood the actions would not be tolerated. In some sense, we are free because we choose to be free.
We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them—economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission. So how do we muscle out of our bind? How do we return from the police state we have become to the land of liberty that we enjoyed a mere three months ago?
One answer is certainly that we must enforce our constitutional rights by challenging the myriad overreaches in court. That is a critically important effort and just the type of pushback I have applauded for many weeks now. But, in tandem to that effort, and really prior to it, we have to shift the mood again.
Not everyone seething about the ongoing abuses by local potentates is going to file a lawsuit, but everyone can contribute to a shift in the national mood. When people honestly express to others their opposition to continued lockdowns, the sentiment spreads and the “mood” strengthens.
Portnoy’s video went viral not just because he is a popular guy; it went viral because it gave voice to people who weren’t sure their gut reactions were “acceptable” and to people who felt encouraged by seeing someone with whom they identified step up and voice opposition.
We all need to step up and speak out. Everyone has a zone of influence, large or small, and when you speak, you add to a critical growing momentum.
We lose freedom ultimately because we let bad people take it from us. Freedom is not taken by force only; it is often taken slowly and quietly, with our foolish consent that is given by silence.
America was not founded to be a police or nanny state. It flourished because it was the land of the free and the home of the brave. It grew to greatness because people were willing to take risks to survive and succeed.
The will of the American people is not just a political platitude, it is a tangible and powerful force for freedom when properly activated. If we want to roll back the abuses—if we want to break the police state and reclaim our livelihoods, futures, and political autonomy—we all have to affirmatively contribute to a new national mood.","['blunt', 'colorful', 'suicide', 'insanity']"
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is aggressively pushing a new wealth tax – which she’s dubbed the “UltraMillionaireTax” – ahead of this weekend’s formal presidential campaign launch, but keeps running into the same question from critics: Is it even constitutional?",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elizabeth-warrens-wealth-tax-faces-constitutional-questions,fox-news,middle-class,right,74.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is aggressively pushing a new wealth tax – which she’s dubbed the “UltraMillionaireTax” – ahead of this weekend’s formal presidential campaign launch, but keeps running into the same question from critics: Is it even constitutional?
If the Massachusetts Democrat’s proposal were to become law, it would almost certainly face a court challenge – thanks to the fact that it’s a tax on wealth, as opposed to a tax on income.
WARREN SIGNALS MORE DOCUMENTS MAY EXIST WITH NATIVE AMERICAN CLAIM
Specifically, Warren has proposed an annual 2 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million and a 3 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.
Billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a likely opponent to Warren in the crowded Democratic 2020 presidential field, has said of her proposal, “the Constitution lets you impose income taxes only, so I think it’s unconstitutional.”
She fired back that billionaires like him and possible independent candidate Howard Schultz “want to keep a rigged system in place that benefits only them and their buddies. … Not on my watch.”
Warren has offered two letters from 17 law professors defending the constitutionality of the proposed tax.
The issue comes down to the type of tax in question. The levy could be considered a “direct tax” imposed on people or the ownership of property, as opposed to an “indirect tax” on the use of property, such as buying, selling or transferring.
If that’s the case, then Warren would run into the tricky issue of “apportionment” — taxing residents differently based on the state where they live.
WARREN PROPOSES NEW WEALTH TAX
Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states, “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.”
So, the government can tax services or property transfers, but can only tax net worth if the tax is applied to each state in proportion to its Census population, argue critics of the Warren plan. Making a tax proportional to population is called “apportionment.”
This is how it might work: State A and State B have the same population -- but a large number of wealthy people live in State A, while only a tiny number of rich people live in State B. The tiny number of rich people in State B would have to pay the same amount as all the rich people in State A. So, individually, rich people living in poor states would be taxed more than rich people in rich states, according to an analysis by Devin Watkins, attorney with the Competitive Enterprise Institute. For example, under apportionment, the wealthy in Mississippi would pay far more than the wealthy in Connecticut.
“A small state with a lot of rich people would not pay as much as a small state with only a few rich people,” Watkins told Fox News.
Warren and legal experts backing her plan say it wouldn't require apportionment, but the matter would face a constitutional fight similar to the ObamaCare battle, said Ilya Shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
“Simply a tax on wealth would be a direct tax that would have to be apportioned among the states, so it would probably have to be done as changing tax rates, depending on how much wealth you have, or some other kind of legal gimmick,” Shapiro told Fox News. “Then the question is raised: How does the IRS determine your wealth? Are you supposed to self-report? How does it count?”
IRS enforcement raises a separate issue.
“No one seems to be looking at the practicality of the proposal. It’s like whack-a-mole. It’s easy to avoid taxes,” said Eileen J. O’Connor, former assistant attorney general for the tax division of the Justice Department. “A valuation of what something is worth can be based on how much someone is willing to pay for it. Governments, estates and lawyers are always arguing over the value.”
The first of the two letters advocating Warren’s plan points to the 1895 ruling in Knowlton v. Moore, regarding taxing inheritances, and concludes, “It follows that your wealth tax proposal is plainly constitutional.”
“Knowlton confronted an inheritance tax that directly hit the property itself,” said the letter signed by professors from Yale, Columbia and American University among others. “Like your proposal, this wealth tax was progressive, increasing the rate from .75% to 3% as inherited property increased in value from $10,000 to $1 million. Nevertheless, the Court unanimously held that the tax was ‘indirect.’”
The second letter contends, “We believe such a law would be a constitutional exercise of Congress’ Article I power. … Constitutional text and history demonstrate that ‘direct’ tax is best interpreted as a narrow category that would not include a net worth tax.”
However, more recent Supreme Court precedent strongly suggests Warren’s plan would be a direct tax, said Watkins of CEI.
Watkins said the Knowlton ruling on inheritance dealt with transfer of a property, irrelevant to the Warren proposal on net worth. The only Supreme Court precedent that would back up Warren’s tax plan, he said, is the 1796 ruling in Hylton v. United States, that held taxes on carriages were not a direct tax, and only taxes on people or land were.
However, the Hylton precedent was overturned by the 1895 case of Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Company, in which the high court held “taxes on personal property, or on the income of personal property, are likewise direct taxes.”

This ruling prompted the eventual passage of the 16th Amendment—which excluded taxes on income from requiring apportionment. However, this did not change the Pollock ruling on personal property, Watkins noted.",['aggressively']

The singer says woke activists have twisted her thoughts on femininity “into a race war.”
“The culture is super sick right now,” said Lana Del Rey in response to the backlash she received over a recent Instagram post.
It all began last week, when Del Rey said female artists sing songs about “being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating, etc” while her critics accuse her of “glamorizing abuse” in her lyrics.
“Question for the culture,” Del Rey said to her 16.5 million Instagram followers. “Now that Doja Cat, Ariana [Grande], Camila [Cabello], Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating etc — can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money — or whatever I want — without being crucified or saying that I’m glamorizing abuse??????”
“I’m fed up with female writers and alt singers saying that I glamorize abuse when in reality I’m just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all over the world,” the Grammy nominated singer said. “With all of the topics women are finally allowed to explore I just want to say over the last ten years I think it’s pathetic that my minor lyrical exploration detailing my sometimes submissive or passive roles in my relationships has often made people say I’ve set women back hundreds of years.”
“Let this be clear, I’m not a feminist,” added Del Rey, “but there has to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me — the kind of woman who says no but men hear yes — the kind of women who are slated mercilessly for being their authentic, delicate selves.”
Del Rey’s remarks were met with jeers as her critics appeared to be riled up by her use of the phrase “women who look like me.”
“Thanks for being so warm and welcoming,” said Del Rey sarcastically in a follow-up post calling out the so-called “feminists” who were outraged over her initial comments.
Watch below:
Del Rey doubled down, saying she’s firm in her stance that her initial post had been about “the need for fragility in the feminist movement,” not race. “When I mentioned women who look like me, I didn’t mean white like me,” Del Rey said. “The culture is super sick right now,” the singer continued, adding that “they want to turn my [Instagram] post, my advocacy for fragility into a race war.”
“So I just want to say to all of the other women out there who are like me, good girls, good intentioned, who get fucked up the ass constantly by the culture just because you say what you really mean, I’m with you,” she added.
Del Rey went on to say that the backlash she has received over the last few days “really makes you reach into the depths of your own heart and say, ‘am I good intentioned?’ and of course, for me, the answer is always yes.”
“I barely ever share a thing, and this is why,” she added. “I’m not the enemy, and I’m definitely not racist, so don’t get it twisted. So God bless, and fuck off if you don’t like the post.”

"The Clinton plan won’t work because it’s a progressive, liberal, quasi-socialist plan applied to something that should operate like a business within a free market",https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/17/mark-cuban-hillarys-college-plan-wont-reduce-student-debt/,federalist,student-debt,right,75.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On the campaign trail last week in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton rolled out her plan to make college more affordable. She said: “College is supposed to help people achieve their dreams. But more and more, paying for college actually pushes those dreams further and further out of reach. That is a betrayal of everything college is supposed to represent.”
Clinton Doesn’t Realize How Colleges Spend Money
Like many liberal policies, it sounds nice. Who wouldn’t want college to be more affordable? But a closer look proves it’s anything but sound. On Friday, via his CyberDust app, billionaire investor and Shark Tank superstar Mark Cuban tore her plan apart calling it “backwards” and offering his own solutions which are, unsurprisingly, free-market based.
Cuban said:
[Hillary’s plan] stands a better chance of increasing the amount of money students owe than decreasing it. How? Just as easy money led to the real estate bubble a few years ago, the easier it is to borrow money for college the easier it is for colleges to raise tuition. Tuition keeps going up because no matter how high they raise it, students can still borrow more to pay for it.
In fact, Clinton’s plan is so inept in its ability to understand how college funding even operates, and so atrociously far from providing any adequate solutions to a complex problem, that it sounds like she was channeling the Simpson’s: “If something’s hard to do, it’s just not worth doing.”
Cuban continued with Clinton’s imprudent plan:
It doesn’t require any change in how a school receiving funds operates. They can still waste money. A lot of it. Competition for new students is fierce. So schools spend billions on perks they think will attract students and donors. They build new buildings, gyms, food courts, dorms, anything that they think provides drive up curb appeal to prospective students. To manage all of the above they hire more and more expensive administrative positions. All of which do nothing to improve education. Instead they just provide justification to increase tuition.If you meet a rich person who gave money to build a new building at your Alma mater, don’t thank them. Explain that the maintenance of that structure and the people who manage it are going to increase tuition for future generations.
He makes an excellent point. The average liberal arts professor’s salary is $83,623. A 2011 Washington Monthly piece reported: “A comprehensive study published by the Delta Cost Project in 2010 reported that between 1998 and 2008, America’s private colleges increased spending on instruction by 22 percent while increasing spending on administration and staff support by 36 percent.”
But the average cost of a liberal arts education is about $26,000 annually, with elite colleges demanding something closer to $50,000 annually. So Clinton wants to make college affordable without looking at how poorly colleges are spending their money, and thereby hiking up costs for the student? That’s ludicrous.
A College Degree Isn’t For Everyone
Part of Clinton’s plan is to hold colleges accountable for students not paying back their loans. But Cuban points out a college degree simply isn’t for everyone. “Not everyone should be a STEM student or business major. Not every company wants to hire only STEM and business graduates. There is a market for smart people with different perspectives. College has gotten so expensive and the amount of debt on students so crushing that schools are already seeing a dramatic decline in liberal arts students and in the number of liberal arts majors offered.”
Instead of motivating kids to payback their loans, Clinton’s plan might actually lead to the decline in liberal arts enrollment, since, as Cuban writes: “the risk of the university being on the hook to repay those students loans as required by the Clinton plan would be much higher.” In essence, “The Clinton plan could push liberal arts colleges and programs to the point of extinction.”
Clinton Can’t Do Math
Finally, Clinton, in a show of ignorance about of the free market that seemed previously impossible, says students will never have to pay more than 10 percent of what they make and all the loans will be forgiven after 20 years.
Cuban rips this logic to shreds and applies the same principle to the real estate market. “You can buy any house you want and you will never have to pay more than 10 percent of your income and after 20 years the mortgage will be forgiven. If it’s under water before then, the person who sold you the house will pick up part of the cost.” Would you spend more on your next house?
Mrs. Clinton: Your plan is an epic failure.
Free Market Solutions Will Make Colleges More Affordable
What will make college affordable? Cuban has a few ideas. It will be interesting to see if any GOP candidates mirror these free market-based suggestions:
The problems with college is how colleges are run. It’s not like things can’t change. I work with Paul Quinn in Dallas, between work study and Pell Grants the net cost to students is close to zero. How did they change the game? They started using open source textbooks so kids didn’t pay outrageous prices for books. They run their school like a business. They innovate. They see their cost model as a competitive advantage and it is. They are the model for the future.
Cuban’s most valuable piece of advice to a candidate trying to figure out how to make college more affordable:
“I would like to see a limit on the amount of private loans a parent or relative can take out or co-sign per year per student. I’m open to anything that reduces the amount of cash available to students to pay for school. That won’t reduce the number of students who will go to college. It will reduce the amount of money they have to pay to go as colleges reduce tuitions to be more competitive.”
The Clinton plan won’t work because it’s a progressive, liberal, quasi-socialist plan applied to something that should operate like a business within a free market. When the market is allowed to operate freely and competitively, it always works fluidly. When a business operating within that structure competes and innovates, everyone utilizing that business–whether it’s a college or a coffee shop–wins.","['quasi-socialist', 'progressive', 'liberal']"
"Those filings are expected to show that Sen. Sanders, the so-called democratic socialist, made millions from book sales.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-releases-tax-returns,fox-news,middle-class,right,75.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren released her 2018 tax returns on Wednesday, showing she and her husband earned nearly $1 million last year.
The Democrat from Massachusetts used the release to once again highlight a bill she’s pushing that would mandate that the Internal Revenue Service publicly release the tax returns of the president, vice president, presidential candidates and federal officeholders.
SANDERS VOWS TO RELEASE RETURNS ON TAX FILING DAY
“I’ve put out eleven years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for. Doing this should be law,” Warren said in a statement, in a likely jab at President Trump and possibly rival Bernie Sanders.
But the details of her high income also come as the candidate doubles down on calls to tax the rich. Warren’s campaign released the candidate’s returns minutes after the senator concluded a speech to a union crowd in the nation’s capital where she once again pushed for her proposal to tax ultra-wealthy Americans based on their assets.
“I’m in this fight for a wealth tax. A two percent tax on the 75 biggest fortunes in the country. Two percent. That’s all we’re asking,” the populist senator with a history of taking on Wall Street and big businesses highlighted as she addressed a gathering of the North America's Building Trades Unions.
“We could provide universal childcare for every working parent in America. Universal pre-K…. for every child and still have $2 trillion left over,” she explained.
The senator released her previous 10 years of tax returns last August.
According to her returns, Warren and her husband Bruce – a professor at Harvard University – paid more than $200,000 in taxes last year on just over $900,000 in income. Warren made about $325,000 in book sales in addition to the $175,000 salary she receives as a senator. Her husband earned around $400,000 from Harvard.
Her comments Tuesday could be interpreted as an indirect jab at Sen. Sanders, a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination who’s making his second straight White House bid. The independent senator from Vermont didn’t release his returns during his 2016 presidential campaign and has faced numerous calls this time around to report his taxes.
Sanders announced Tuesday in an interview with the New York Times that he'll release 10 years of tax returns on Monday. Those filings are expected to show that the so-called democratic socialist made millions from book sales.
Warren’s comments also appeared to be a dig at Trump. Both as a candidate for the White House and as president, Trump has refused to release any of his federal income tax returns. The now-Democratic controlled House of Representatives is pushing for the president to release six years of his returns.
Trump on Wednesday repeated his vow not to release his taxes, claiming he's under audit. The president’s broken with decades of precedent by refusing to disclose his returns both before and after winning the White House.
GILLIBRAND THE FIRST 2020 CONTENDER TO RELEASE 2018 TAXES
Last month Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York became the first Democratic presidential contender to release tax returns.
Besides Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg are among those White House hopefuls who’ve yet to release their returns. But tax returns are not due to the IRS until next Monday, April 15.",['so-called']

This sparked an outcry from 12,000 disappointed delegates, diplomats and non-government organizations scheduled to fly into New York for the event and work towards ending “default male thinking” across the globalist organization.
The annual U.N. Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) meeting promoting “equality and women’s empowerment” was scaled back to just one-day next week due the global viral outbreak.
In its abbreviated version, the CSW will hold a procedural meeting on March 9 – the day after International Women’s Day – to adopt a draft political declaration marking 25 years since the women’s rights declaration was signed in Beijing.
Critics say the conference cancellation is a “blow to progress in women’s rights” and needs to be immediately rescheduled to include “more diverse voices” than those of diplomats already based in New York.
Ma.Victoria (Mavic) Cabrera Balleza, Chief Executive Officer, Global Network of Women Peacebuilders, said the session should not be cancelled because of the outbreak of coronavirus disease — but its methodology should be modified.
“It is a very important event that brings a big momentum to our advocacy for women’s rights and gender equality, especially this year as we are commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most comprehensive global women’s rights agenda,” she pointed out.
On Twitter, We Effect, a Swedish development group, concurred, saying: “In solidarity with women’s movements across the globe We Effect joins the demand to #postponeCSW. #CSW64 on #genderequality can’t be held without safe, meaningful and informed participation of women.”
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called women’s inequality “stupid” and a cause for global shame, personally pledging to press governments to end discriminatory laws in the face of a “strong and relentless pushback” against women’s rights.
Speaking last week ahead of the now canceled meeting, Guterres warned the state of women’s rights was “dire” and said he would back efforts to end “default male thinking” across the United Nations.
“Just as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women’s inequality should shame us all in the 21st. Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid,” Guterres said in a speech to the New School in New York.
He said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were being diluted or rolled back and that in 34 countries rape within marriage was still legal.
“There is a strong and relentless pushback against women’s rights,” Guterres warned the world. “Women’s sexual and reproductive rights are under threat from different sides.”

"We just survived eight years of a messianic presidency, with a finger-wagging, patriotism-appropriating administration lecturing us on how to be proper Americans.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/24/trumps-national-day-patriotic-creepy/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,75.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"First it was 'economic patriotism.' Now it's 'economic nationalism.' Stop telling us how to be patriotic.
Politicians have no business directing or defining patriotism — especially when their rhetoric sounds like 1950s-era Soviet sloganeering.
It was creepy when Barack Obama declared his first inauguration day a “National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation” and “called” on us to find “common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century.” And it’s creepy when Donald Trump declares his inauguration day a “National Day of Patriotic Devotion;” one in which “a new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart.”
You can find both, unfortunately, in the Federal Register.
This kind of self-aggrandizement is what you see under cults of personality, not American republicanism. Far be it from me to lecture anyone on how to love his country, but if your devotion to America is contingent on the party in office, you’re probably not doing it like the Founders envisioned. It’s bad enough that these inaugurations are treated as coronations. It can’t be patriotic to treat politicians like quasi-religious figures. Moreover, it ties patriotism — either implicitly, or in some cases rather explicitly — to a preferred set of policy initiatives or a political office.
We just survived eight years of a messianic presidency, with a finger-wagging, patriotism-appropriating administration lecturing us on how to be proper Americans. If you didn’t support the administration’s point of view, Joe Biden might accuse you of “betting against America.”
“What we need as a nation,” then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, echoing the president, wrote to a Republican Congress in 2014, “is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise or fall together.” Was Lew talking about our unalienable right to free expression? No, he was talking about punishing America-based companies that were trying to lower their tax burden, which happens to be one of the highest rates in the free world.
If we’re going to play this game, by the way, avoiding excessive taxation is also one of the most American things we can do.
So it was creepy when Obama was trying to replace American idealism with progressivism and calling it “economic patriotism,” and it’s creepy when Trump does basically the same thing under the guise of economic nationalism.
Now, judging from the campaign rhetoric, failing to support tariffs or other counterproductive “buy American” economic policies will have you branded seditious over the next four years. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who probably had something to do with the devotion order, has referred to himself as “economic nationalist,” a loaded term that means you only love your country if you support mercantilism. Economic nationalists rely on a populism that lays blame on others — Mexico, China, whoever — for American problems. It’s a philosophy, if we listen to Bannon or Trump, that values power over most principles, including liberty. So it sounds like many things, none of them American patriotism.
The idea is amorphous, but patriotism, especially in this country, is driven by idealism rather than chauvinism, ethnicity, or “power.” As George Orwell famously noted, nationalism isn’t the same as patriotism. In the American sense, patriotism is a fidelity to a place and the Constitution, and is by its nature “defensive, both militarily and culturally.” Nationalism, on the other hand, “is inseparable from the desire for power.” A devotional to our “new national pride” strongly hints at the latter.
You can hate your president and love your country. You can hope your president fails and still be patriotic. We don’t always have a “shared purpose.” That’s because presidents are not only commanders in chief, they are politicians with agendas. And sometimes those agendas clash with your worldview. Let’s not have devotionals venerating of their ascendency every four years.","['messianic', 'presidency', 'finger-wagging', 'patriotism-appropriating', 'lecturing']"

“You know what I am? I’m a nationalist. Okay? A nationalist. Use that word,” Trump said during his rally in Texas on Monday evening. After showing the footage, Stephen Colbert contended that there is no difference between civic nationalism and white nationalism.
“You know why you’re not supposed to use that word? Because it’s the second half of ‘white nationalist,’” Colbert said. “Chopping off the first word doesn’t change what it means in our minds! Oh look, I’m a Klux Klan. I have no idea which one! Don’t judge me! There are all kinds of Klux Klans!”
Colbert went on to play a clip of Trump decrying globalism, an ideology he described as people who “want the globe to do well, but frankly not caring about our country so much.”
“He does realize that America is on the globe, right?” Colbert asked, before imitating Trump: “Look, I’m gonna shoot you straight: who cares about global warming? Wake me up when it’s America warming.”
During the segment, Colbert also bemoaned the fact that Barack Obama is no longer president.
“Yesterday the president had an important message,” he said, before showing a clip of Obama declaring the midterms an opportunity to “restore some sanity to our politics.”
“Come back, why did you leave, it’s our fault?” Colbert responded, before pretending to cry. “You said you were just going out for a pack of smokes.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) slammed billionaire Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world and owner of the Washington Post, for paying his employees what she called “starvation wages.”
ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked Ocasio-Cortez on This Week with George Stephanopoulos Sunday if her brand of democratic socialism would allow people to become billionaires like Bezos, who started Amazon in 1994.
“I spend less time thinking about Jeff Bezos and more time about warehouse workers,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But if his being a billionaire is predicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of their ability to access healthcare …”
“Amazon increased the minimum wage to $15 last November in response to criticism,” the Daily Mail reported. “The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009.”
“When you have a very large workforce and you underpay every single person and then you also participate in taking billions of dollars of government subsidies, that could be part of it,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
“Whether Jeff Bezos is a billionaire or not is less of my concern than if your average Amazon worker is making a living wage if they have guaranteed health care and if they can send their kids to college tuition-free,’ Ocasio-Cortez said.
“And if that’s the case, and Jeff Bezos is still a billionaire, that’s one thing,” Ocasio-Cortez.
Last week Ocasio Cortez and presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) vowed to outlaw Amazon’s new “credit builder” card that the company and its banking partner said is designed to help people with no credit or bad credit.
The Daily Mail reported:
Amazon launched its new secured credit card earlier this week. Users pay a deposit – in Amazon’s case between $100 and $1,000 – to ‘secure’ a line of credit which acts as collateral and sets their spending limit. In Amazon’s case, the cards would only be available to those on their $119-per-year Prime package. The deposit would only be repaid when customers upgrade to a regular Amazon Store Card after seven months of on-time payments. Both the secured card and store card can only be used for Amazon purchases.
The interest rate on the Amazon card, which is meant to be paid off each month to avoid paying any interest, is 28.24 percent.

Flake has been planning his grandstanding on the Senate floor more than he’s been planning to pass legislation the president can pass to address ObamaCare, tax reform, infrastructure, or the myriad of other problems facing our country.
While Flake’s audience ate up every moment of this speech, who really cares? His approval rating is at 18 percent, as in most of the Phoenix phone book has a higher approval rating than he does. Sadly, Flake was preaching to the liberal choir in the Acela corridor, not his voters out in Arizona. So to other members of Congress, feel free to literally knock yourselves out and play to the D.C. and New York City elites. I mean, they're not voting for you, but I bet they’ll buy your book.
So give me a break, Jeff Flake. Put a cork in it, Bob. Do the work you were elected to do, or get out. Remember, winners make policy and losers go home. I'd love for you to go out as winners, but since some of your loser colors have shown through, maybe it is just best you go home.

If a car dealership is already overflowing with cars, why buy another car? If a construction site already has more than enough day laborers, why hire another day laborer? If a far-left news organization already has a massive pile of Never Trump voices, why hire John Kasich?
CNN announced Tuesday that it has added former Ohio Governor John Kasich to its crack team of analysts…
Why?
The anti-Trump news outlet is already jammed up with Never Trump voices, with a countless number of bitter Republicans who hate Trump. In fact, on Monday, the fake news outlet announced it hired two anti-Trumpers who helped to drive the Weekly Standard into the ground.
Why?
What can these guys, what can a 66-year-old John Kasich add to a last-place cable channel already overflowing with the only thing Kasich has to offer? Just off the top of my head, CNN is already filled with useless and uninteresting Never Trump deadwood: SE Cupp, Max Boot, Amanda Carpenter, David Frum, Anna Navarro, Mia Love, Margaret Hoover…
What can Kasich possibly add?
Now, I completely understand why CNN (and the Washington Post and the New York Times and NBC News and the rest) would not hire Trump supporters. The media have an agenda. They want to drive Trump from office by any means necessary, including the use of violence, and will do anything to stop him from serving a second term or furthering his mandate. That I get… There is no mystery about that…
But ANOTHER Never Trump voice? Why add another soprano to a chorus already filled with sopranos?
The whole idea that Kasich might challenge Trump in 2020 for the Republican nomination is the biggest pile of fake news ever shoveled.
During the 2016 Republican primary, and as that state’s sitting governor, Kasich was only able to win with a plurality of Ohio votes. Other than Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) losing his home state to Trump, it does not get any more pathetic than that.
What’s more, in 2016, Kasich was still seen an something resembling a conservative. This was before he came out of the closet as a Democrat, as a pro-abortion governor in the pocket of left-wing unions.
If Kasich does challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020, it will be a total vanity project because his campaign is a non-starter.
Now that Kasich has embraced the far-left, where will his establishment support come from — other than those willing to reveal that they too oppose right-to-work laws and support late-term abortion, not to mention Obamacare, gun control, open borders, high taxes, and the Climate Change hoax.
On every critical issue — Obamacare, guns, taxes, global warming, immigration, unions, Kasich is a Democrat, which makes the noise surrounding his 2020 grab for the GOP nomination a joke.
So let me ask again, why add an unnecessary voice to an already overstaffed chorus, someone who will be lost in the cacophony?
What I see is a big political payoff, not only a direct payoff to Kasich, but a way to send a message to other Republicans that if they sell out, if they betray their own, CNN and the Washington Post and the New York Times and the rest of the media will pay you off, will create an unnecessary job for you as a reward, and do so regardless of your talent, popularity, credibility, or conservative credentials.
Obviously, this is a terrible business model. But the media are not about the business of journalism or even the business of business. This is all about a political agenda, and if that means creating a lucrative slush fund for Never Trump losers as a means to create more Never Trump losers, so be it.

"Republicans, however, are likely to vehemently oppose the plan to tax the wealthy.",https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/key-democrat-pushes-new-tax-on-wealthy-targeting-unrealized-capital-gains,fox-news,middle-class,right,76.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, a ranking member on the influential Senate Finance Committee, announced this week he is developing a new way to tax the wealthy – aimed at overhauling the capital gains tax structure.
Continue Reading Below
Capital gains taxes are currently paid on the difference between what an individual originally paid for a property or investment and what she sold it for – at the time it is sold.
The current top capital gains rate sits at 23.8 percent. The highest income bracket tax rate, by contrast, is 37 percent.
Wyden is proposing that unrealized capital gains are taxed annually – meaning that these assets are taxed each year their value appreciates even if the owner does not sell them. Under his proposal, they would be taxed at ordinary income rates – meaning the top rate would increase to that 37 percent level, from less than 24 percent.
Economists often refer to this type of proposal as “mark-to-market.”
Wyden, who is proposing the change as a means to combat inequality, said in a statement that the mark-to-market approach would eliminate “serious loopholes that allow some to pay a lower rate than wage earners, to delay their taxes indefinitely, and in some cases, to avoid paying tax at all.”
He is expected to release a white paper outlining the idea.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that more than 90 percent of the benefits from the reduced capital gains rate accrue to households in the highest income quintile.
Republicans, however, are likely to vehemently oppose the plan. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania called the proposal a “breathtakingly terrible idea,” as reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute and editor of www.DownsizingGovernment.org – who opposes the measure – said there are a number of economic reasons why capital gains have been subject to different tax rules.
“Low capital gains taxes mitigate the harmful effects of inflation and encourage investment in risky start-ups and growth companies,” Edwards told FOX Business. “Silicon Valley crucially depends upon investors waiting patiently for years as their risky investments in growth companies to pay off with a realized capital gain.”
He also says many investors do not have the liquidity to pay taxes on the assets annually as they appreciate in value.
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, one of the world’s wealthiest men, has cautioned against support for some of the Democratic party’s more progressive tax proposals – including freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent income tax. He has, however, called for reforms to the capital gains tax structure.
“The big fortunes, if your goal is to go after those, you have to take the capital gains tax, which is far lower at like 20 percent, and increase that,” Gates said on CNN in February.
Taxing capital gains income and ordinary income at the same rate “would get rid of a lot of complexity, because whenever those rates vary, you want to make one look like the other,” he said.
Wyden follows a host of others in his party with plans to tax the wealthy as a means of combating income and wealth inequality.

"Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy has led to record-low unemployment for the bottom-tier of working and middle-class Americans, as well as major wage hikes thanks to a tightened labor market.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/07/fact-check-buttigieg-falsely-claims-trump-turns-his-back-on-middle-class/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,77.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"CLAIM: Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, claimed during ABC News’s 2020 Democrat debate that President Trump “turns his back” on middle-class communities.
VERDICT: False. Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy has led to record-low unemployment for the bottom-tier of working and middle-class Americans, as well as major wage hikes thanks to a tightened labor market.
“We’re going to force this president to stand up on that debate stage next to somebody who actually lives in a middle-class neighborhood,” Buttigieg said. “In the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he tends to speak for but turns his back on.”
In fact, the South Bend-Mishawaka metropolitan area has continued to see a drop in unemployment and job gains as part of Trump’s economic nationalist agenda.
Since Trump became president, the South Bend metro area has enjoyed an unemployment rate that has never exceeded 4.6 percent, and which has dropped as low as 3.2 percent — sometimes lower than the national unemployment rate.
Likewise, some of the forgotten working and middle-class populations — those who have suffered from wage stagnation for decades — have secured wage increases thanks to Trump’s policies. This week, the New York Times admitted that black Americans’ wages are “finally rising” after a “decade of stagnation.”
Working-class Americans, like those who make up the majority of South Bend residents, have secured the largest wage hikes in the nation compared to all other economic demographic groups — a direct result of Trump tightening the labor market.

"Instead of motivating kids to payback their loans, Clinton’s plan might actually lead to the decline in liberal arts enrollment.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/17/mark-cuban-hillarys-college-plan-wont-reduce-student-debt/,federalist,student-debt,right,77.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On the campaign trail last week in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton rolled out her plan to make college more affordable. She said: “College is supposed to help people achieve their dreams. But more and more, paying for college actually pushes those dreams further and further out of reach. That is a betrayal of everything college is supposed to represent.”
Clinton Doesn’t Realize How Colleges Spend Money
Like many liberal policies, it sounds nice. Who wouldn’t want college to be more affordable? But a closer look proves it’s anything but sound. On Friday, via his CyberDust app, billionaire investor and Shark Tank superstar Mark Cuban tore her plan apart calling it “backwards” and offering his own solutions which are, unsurprisingly, free-market based.
Cuban said:
[Hillary’s plan] stands a better chance of increasing the amount of money students owe than decreasing it. How? Just as easy money led to the real estate bubble a few years ago, the easier it is to borrow money for college the easier it is for colleges to raise tuition. Tuition keeps going up because no matter how high they raise it, students can still borrow more to pay for it.
In fact, Clinton’s plan is so inept in its ability to understand how college funding even operates, and so atrociously far from providing any adequate solutions to a complex problem, that it sounds like she was channeling the Simpson’s: “If something’s hard to do, it’s just not worth doing.”
Cuban continued with Clinton’s imprudent plan:
It doesn’t require any change in how a school receiving funds operates. They can still waste money. A lot of it. Competition for new students is fierce. So schools spend billions on perks they think will attract students and donors. They build new buildings, gyms, food courts, dorms, anything that they think provides drive up curb appeal to prospective students. To manage all of the above they hire more and more expensive administrative positions. All of which do nothing to improve education. Instead they just provide justification to increase tuition.If you meet a rich person who gave money to build a new building at your Alma mater, don’t thank them. Explain that the maintenance of that structure and the people who manage it are going to increase tuition for future generations.
He makes an excellent point. The average liberal arts professor’s salary is $83,623. A 2011 Washington Monthly piece reported: “A comprehensive study published by the Delta Cost Project in 2010 reported that between 1998 and 2008, America’s private colleges increased spending on instruction by 22 percent while increasing spending on administration and staff support by 36 percent.”
But the average cost of a liberal arts education is about $26,000 annually, with elite colleges demanding something closer to $50,000 annually. So Clinton wants to make college affordable without looking at how poorly colleges are spending their money, and thereby hiking up costs for the student? That’s ludicrous.
A College Degree Isn’t For Everyone
Part of Clinton’s plan is to hold colleges accountable for students not paying back their loans. But Cuban points out a college degree simply isn’t for everyone. “Not everyone should be a STEM student or business major. Not every company wants to hire only STEM and business graduates. There is a market for smart people with different perspectives. College has gotten so expensive and the amount of debt on students so crushing that schools are already seeing a dramatic decline in liberal arts students and in the number of liberal arts majors offered.”
Instead of motivating kids to payback their loans, Clinton’s plan might actually lead to the decline in liberal arts enrollment, since, as Cuban writes: “the risk of the university being on the hook to repay those students loans as required by the Clinton plan would be much higher.” In essence, “The Clinton plan could push liberal arts colleges and programs to the point of extinction.”
Clinton Can’t Do Math
Finally, Clinton, in a show of ignorance about of the free market that seemed previously impossible, says students will never have to pay more than 10 percent of what they make and all the loans will be forgiven after 20 years.
Cuban rips this logic to shreds and applies the same principle to the real estate market. “You can buy any house you want and you will never have to pay more than 10 percent of your income and after 20 years the mortgage will be forgiven. If it’s under water before then, the person who sold you the house will pick up part of the cost.” Would you spend more on your next house?
Mrs. Clinton: Your plan is an epic failure.
Free Market Solutions Will Make Colleges More Affordable
What will make college affordable? Cuban has a few ideas. It will be interesting to see if any GOP candidates mirror these free market-based suggestions:
The problems with college is how colleges are run. It’s not like things can’t change. I work with Paul Quinn in Dallas, between work study and Pell Grants the net cost to students is close to zero. How did they change the game? They started using open source textbooks so kids didn’t pay outrageous prices for books. They run their school like a business. They innovate. They see their cost model as a competitive advantage and it is. They are the model for the future.
Cuban’s most valuable piece of advice to a candidate trying to figure out how to make college more affordable:
“I would like to see a limit on the amount of private loans a parent or relative can take out or co-sign per year per student. I’m open to anything that reduces the amount of cash available to students to pay for school. That won’t reduce the number of students who will go to college. It will reduce the amount of money they have to pay to go as colleges reduce tuitions to be more competitive.”
The Clinton plan won’t work because it’s a progressive, liberal, quasi-socialist plan applied to something that should operate like a business within a free market. When the market is allowed to operate freely and competitively, it always works fluidly. When a business operating within that structure competes and innovates, everyone utilizing that business–whether it’s a college or a coffee shop–wins.",['decline']
A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. ,https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/21/facts-mass-shootings-support-gun-ownership-not-gun-control/?utm_source=The+Federalist+List&utm_campaign=e01eef4417-RSS_The_Federalist_Daily_Updates_w_Transom&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cfcb868ceb-e01eef4417-83843357,federalist,gun-control,right,77.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democrats shouldn't add more gun control laws to the books when the shootings in both Parkland and Aurora could've been prevented by existing policies.
On February 14, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) marked the one-year anniversary of a horrific school shooting by threatening that President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall could be used as precedent for future gun control.
Calling the 2018 massacre of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America,” Pelosi remarked, “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President?”
“A Democratic president,” she threatened, “can do that.”
By painting the tragic Parkland shooting as a failure of gun control, however, Pelosi disregards the indisputable fact that the shooter’s rampage was enabled by years-long, system-wide failures of policy and personnel.
Andrew Pollack, the father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, is on a campaign to hold those who failed the Parkland victims accountable. This includes the resource officer and deputies whose inadequate response allowed the shooting spree to continue for 11 long minutes, the FBI officials who ignored a tip about the shooter’s intentions just over a month prior to the attack, the Broward County superintendent whose “Promise” program kept students’ criminal activities from being reported to police, and the school officials, mental health providers, and officials from the Broward Sheriff’s Office who ignored a series of red flags, not to mention murderer’s lengthy history of violence and mental health issues.
These Tragedies Happened Despite Legal Barriers
Judging by the sheer number of pending legal claims against Broward Country Public Schools (103 as of December 2018), Pollack is not the only parent of a victim or survivor to find that fault extends beyond the shooter and his weapon. The families of two Parkland victims are also filing suit against the manufacturer of Cruz’s AR-15, and the store where he purchased it.
On Friday, just one day after Pelosi threatened future gun control initiatives, America experienced another preventable and horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois. After he was fired from his job, Gary Martin used a pistol he unlawfully possessed to shoot employees in his workplace. Martin killed six employees, and wounded five of the police officers who responded to the scene before he was killed by police.
As a convicted felon, Martin should not have possessed a weapon. When applying for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card in January 2014, he lied about his previous felony conviction for aggravated assault. After he purchased his pistol in March, Martin also applied for a concealed carry permit. When the fingerprinting process revealed Martin’s criminal history in Mississippi, police turned down Martin’s application, revoked his FOID card, and informed him that he must relinquish his weapon within 48 hours. Instead, Martin kept the pistol.
Non-compliance with police orders regarding weapons and FOID turnover is not uncommon. In 2018, 10,818 FOID cards were revoked by the Illinois State Police, who admitted on Monday that “in most instances” a weapon and official record are not returned. Law enforcement is able to petition a judge for a search warrant to retrieve guns that are not turned over, but according to Illinois law, they are not required to do so.
In Aurora, existing gun laws failed. In Parkland, a host of authorities and policies failed. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.
Pelosi’s threat of future gun control initiatives does not stand alone. During the 2018 midterm elections, more candidates aired “spots promot[ing] gun control than oppos[ing] it.” In the wake of the Aurora attack, Democratic presidential candidates are loudly decrying gun violence, and advocating for stricter gun control measures.
Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. Last Wednesday, while the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to require background checks on every gun sale or transfer, Democrats rejected Republicans’ efforts to add an amendment that would ensure law enforcement is notified “when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check.”
Most Americans Favor Legal Gun Ownership
A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. According to a March 2018 poll, 58 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “increase[s] public safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.”
James Craig, who returned to his native Detroit as its chief of police in June 2013, believes in the strength of a legally armed populace. After working as a police officer for nearly three decades in Los Angeles, “where ‘it took an act of Congress’ to get permission to carry a gun,” Craig transferred to Portland, Maine. There, he discovered a vastly safer city, and one where gun ownership was common. It was in Portland that Craig realized “the effect…good Americans who are armed can have on reducing violence.”
Prior to Craig’s arrival, Detroit was among the most violent cities in the country. According to FBI statistics, 80 in 1000 Detroit residents “became victims of violent or property crime each year.” In 2012, 386 criminal homicides had been reported in the city. To bring down crime rates, the new chief of police urged Detroit residents to legally and safely arm themselves.
In 2014, Craig’s department issued 1,100 handgun permits. That year, the number of home invasions decreased by 38 percent, with the numbers of shootings and robberies likewise decreasing. Of the 1,800 felons queried in a 2015 survey, 57 percent identified their biggest fear as “armed citizens.”
Since Craig took over the department, Detroit has experienced “double-digit drops” in “nonfatal shootings, robberies, and carjackings.” Although the city’s levels of violence still leave much to be desired, in 2017, Detroit recorded its “lowest number of homicides since 1966.”
Craig believes a conversation surrounding guns should not be about gun control, but “crime control.” As he explains, “individuals who are criminally inclined…when in possession of a weapon, create the problems.”
Before Democrats look to new measures of gun control, they should concern themselves with the enforcement of existing gun laws, keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, and holding accountable institutions and policies which allow threats to go undetected.
If Democrats impede law-abiding Americans from arming themselves to protect their fellow citizens, and themselves, then the only people with access to weapons will be those who purchase them illegally, with criminal intent.",['demagoguery']

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was only the second to mention coronavirus directly, though the issue had emerged weeks before it was first discussed by the candidates.
President Donald Trump first mentioned coronavirus on Jan. 22, after it was brought up in a press conference. Vice President Mike Pence discussed it more extensively on Jan. 27. The president imposed a China travel ban Jan. 31.
On Feb. 4, President Trump mentioned coronavirus in his State of the Union address, which was torn up by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Congress was still in the midst of the impeachment trial until Feb. 5.
Democrats did not mention the coronavirus much at all, and it did not come up in the presidential primary debate in Iowa (Jan. 14). Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg referred to it indirectly in the New Hampshire debate (Feb. 7): “The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we’re seeing coming out of China.”
It did not come up in Nevada (Feb. 19). It was first discussed somewhat extensively by the candidates in the South Carolina debate (Feb. 25), which is also when a moderator finally asked candidates about it.
While watching tonight's Democratic debate, consider the number of times moderators asked any questions involving coronavirus at the past four Democratic debates: CBS News – February 26: 1 (83rd minute)
NBC News – February 19: 0
ABC News – February 7: 0
CNN – January 14: 0 — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) March 15, 2020
Coronavirus was first brought up by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who accused the president (inaccurately) of firing the pandemic specialists and cutting funding to the Centers for Disease Control. It was mentioned next by Buttigieg, in the context of national security.
The moderator then asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) whether she would close the borders to “prevent an outbreak” in the United States. She did not answer the question directly, but said she would have coordinated her response better through the presidency than Trump had. Biden was asked about it and mentioned his experience during the fight against Ebola in 2014. Left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer said the president’s “America First” foreign policy was inadequate for coronavirus. He reiterated his criticism of the president’s response to coronavirus in the spin room after the debate, saying that Trump was incompetent.
If it could be said that the U.S. government could have done more, and earlier, to fight the coronavirus outbreak, it could also be said that the opposition and the media largely ignored the issue until more than a month after the Trump administration had begun to talk about it. Few anticipated how great a challenge coronavirus would be.

Gun-rights supporters had organized a big rally in Richmond, Virginia, to protest several gun-control bills being pushed by the Democrat-controlled legislature. Tens of thousands rallied peacefully and the news media treated it like it was the start of the second civil war or at least another violent confrontation like Charlottesville.
Several news outlets pushed the claim that the rally was made up of “white supremacists” or “white nationalists.” Instead, they got a rally that was so peaceful that the protesters even picked up their own trash when they were done.
VIRGINIA'S CAPITOL FLOODED WITH GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS FOR SECOND AMENDMENT RALLY
The Washington Post’s front-page story previewing the event led off by saying the rally was, “in the words of some, to fan the flames of a civil war.” The Post mirrored left-wing outlets like Vox, which hyped “online calls for a civil war,” and the UK Guardian which claimed “Gun owners are talking civil war.”
The press did everything it could to terrify people about the event. NBC and its sister network MSNBC couldn’t contain their anti-gun rhetoric. NBC News’ “Dystopia” Reporter Ben Collins called the event “tomorrow's white nationalist rally in Virginia.” Oddly, he also urged reporters to “verify information” before publishing. He was so widely criticized for it, he finally deleted the post.
NBC Anchor Lester Holt pushed a comparison to the riot that happened in Charlottesville where one counter-protester was killed by a white nationalist. “Police on high alert after the governor declared a state of emergency saying he feared another Charlottesville,” said Holt.

The network even posted a story about how residents feared the event of “gun rights activists, white nationalists and militia groups” “will turn violent.” And NBC News Correspondent Gabe Gutierrez falsely posted a video that he said included “Chants of ‘we will not comply’ from gun rights protesters in Richmond.
It was protesters reciting the “Pledge of Allegiance.”
MSNBC Anchor Craig Melvin continued the media lunacy, claiming, “Armed militia, white nationalist groups from all over the country taking part on MLK day.” Fellow Anchor Andrea Mitchell also went for the comparison, cautioning that, “Virginia residents praying today's rally at the state capitol is not a repeat of the horrible 2017 Charlottesville disaster.”
The media and the left did their best to ignore the racial diversity of the well-armed crowd or how only one person was arrested (and that for refusing to remove a face mask.)

Several attendees actually carried signs with the medical school yearbook photo of Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam in either blackface or wearing a KKK outfit. One such sign summed it up nicely: “Governor Northam, I think I found the white supremacist. Unfortunately, it’s you!”
The sign was a stark reminder of how journalists had given the governor a pass on his own racism because he was pushing a liberal agenda they supported.

If a woman has a penis, her penis is a biologically female penis. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 17, 2019
The declaration is built on the transgender claim that men who say they are women are actually women. But once the men are women, their bodies are women’s bodies. So men’s penises become female penises.
Moore extended the “female penis” claim by declaring the existence of ‘male vaginas,’ which are presumably carried by women who are living as men.
The “female penis” claim went viral because it spotlights the logic of the transgender ideology, which insists the Department of Justice must blur and forbid any legal or civic recognition of the biological distinctions between the two different and complementary male and female sexes.
This policy must be imposed to ensure that children and adults can easily discard their female or male sex by simply declaring they have an opposite-sex “gender,” or have a “gender identity” which is between male and female, say transgender activists.
A person’s “gender,” say activists, is their personal feeling about being female or male, or something in between. For example, Moore’s feelings are described as “binary,” or neither male nor female.

Moore took the often-heard rallying cry “trans women are women” one step further: She argued that if trans women are biological women, by definition, a trans woman’s penis is “a biologically female penis.” That’s a radical point missing in mainstream discussions on trans bodies, as trans women are often made to feel as if they should be ashamed of their genitals if they don’t have a vagina.
“Don’t use science to justify your bigotry,” Moore tweeted at critics of the “female penis” claim. “The world is way too weird for that s**t.”
The transgender effort to suppress any recognition that men and women are different and complementary would not matter except for the movement’s political alliance with wealthy progressives and radical feminists who wish to destroy the political power of the male-and-female family.
For example, editors at the New York Times invited a February 7 op-ed which smeared women who reject the political claim that gender is more important than biology. Author Sophie Lewis described the vast majority of women as “terfs”:
… the most vocal trans-exclusionary voices are, ostensibly, “feminist” ones, and anti-trans lobbying is a mainstream activity. Case in point: Ms. Parker told the podcast “Feminist Current” that she’d changed her thinking on trans women after spending time on Mumsnet, a site where parents exchange tips on toilet training and how to get their children to eat vegetables. If such a place sounds benign, consider the words of British writer Edie Miller: “Mumsnet is to British transphobia,” she wrote “what 4Chan is to American fascism.” The term coined to identify women like Ms. Parker and Dr. Long is TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In Britain, TERFs are a powerful force. If, in the United States, the mainstream media has been alarmingly ready to hear “both sides” on the question of trans people’s right to exist, in Britain, TERFs have effectively succeeded in framing the question of trans rights entirely around their own concerns: that is, how these rights for others could contribute to “female erasure.” Many prominent figures in British journalism and politics have been TERFs; British TV has made a sport of endlessly hosting their lurid rudeness and styling it as courage; British newspapers seemingly never tire of broadsides against the menace of “gender ideology.” (With time, the term TERF has become a catchall for all anti-trans feminists, radical or not.)
Lewis’ radical support for the transgender ideology is logical because she wants to minimize the role of male-and-female families. A review of her book, Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family, says:
Rather than making [birth] surrogacy illegal or allowing it to continue as is, Sophie Lewis argues we should be looking to radically transform it. Surrogates should be put front and center, and their rights to the babies they gestate should be expanded to acknowledge that they are more than mere vessels. In doing so we can break down our assumptions that children necessarily belong to those whose genetics they share. This might sound like a radical proposal but expanding our idea of who children belong to would be a good thing. Taking collective responsibility for children, rather than only caring for the ones we share DNA with, would radically transform notions of kinship. Adopting this expanded concept of surrogacy helps us to see that it always, as the saying goes, takes a village to raise a child.
But Lewis’ ‘Terf’ smear is also aimed at lesbians who wish to maintain a clear distinction between women and men. For example, former tennis star Martina Navratilova is being slammed by political activists for her growing opposition to transgenderism in sports. The Guardian reported February:
The former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has been criticised for “disturbing, upsetting, and deeply transphobic” comments after she argued that allowing transgender women [men] to compete in women’s sporting tournaments was “insane and cheating”. The tennis player and gay rights campaigner first drew criticism from equalities activists and trans athletes when she tweeted in December: “You can’t just proclaim yourself a female and be able to compete against women. There must be some standards, and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.” … “To put the argument at its most basic: a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to [fathering] babies if he so desires. “It’s insane and it’s cheating. I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair.”
The Guardian also saw fit to quote a man who is living as a woman describing Navratilova as beset by “transphobia,” as if the former tennis star is mentally ill.
Democrats argue that It is “cruel and unscientific” to define each person’s legal sex by biology. But if sex is not defined by biology/human nature, it will be redefined by politicians & the transgender lobby – regardless of damage to women, men & children https://t.co/4sjsAj9PrN — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 12, 2018
Navratilova’s criticism of the transgender ideology is increasingly echoed by women who say the ideology will erase society’s understanding of women — and of lesbians — as biologically, sexually, and socially very different from men.
This “biology matters” argument is also being made by Andrew Sullivan, a British-born gay advocate who led the political push to allow single-sex marriages. In a February article titled “The Nature of Sex,” Sullivan argues that a pending Democratic-drafted bill which provides legal recognition and rights to people who try to live as members of the opposite sex:
could put all single-sex institutions, events, or groups in legal jeopardy. It could deny lesbians their own unique safe space, free from any trace of men. The bill, in other words, “undermines the fundamental legal groundwork for recognizing and combating sex-based oppression and sex discrimination against women and girls.”
The transgender push to create legal rights for people living as members of the opposite sex would also threaten the legal rights won by gays and lesbians, Sullivan writes:
If you abandon biology in the matter of sex and gender altogether, you may help trans people live fuller, less conflicted lives; but you also undermine the very meaning of homosexuality. If you follow the current ideology of gender as entirely fluid, you actually subvert and undermine core arguments in defense of gay rights. “A gay man loves and desires other men, and a lesbian desires and loves other women,” explains Sky Gilbert, a drag queen. “This defines the existential state of being gay. If there is no such thing as ‘male’ or ‘female,’ the entire self-definition of gay identity, which we have spent generations seeking to validate and protect from bigots, collapses.” Contemporary transgender ideology is not a complement to gay rights; in some ways it is in active opposition to them.
And the truth is that many lesbians and gay men are quite attached to the concept of sex as a natural, biological, material thing. Yes, we are very well aware that sex can be expressed in many different ways. A drag queen and a rugby player are both biologically men, with different expressions of gender. Indeed, a drag queen can also be a rugby player and express his gender identity in a variety of ways, depending on time and place. But he is still a man. And gay men are defined by our attraction to our own biological sex. We are men and attracted to other men. If the concept of a man is deconstructed, so that someone without a penis is a man, then homosexuality itself is deconstructed. Transgender people pose no threat to us, and the vast majority of gay men and lesbians wholeheartedly support protections for transgender people. But transgenderist ideology — including postmodern conceptions of sex and gender — is indeed a threat to homosexuality, because it is a threat to biological sex as a concept.
A growing percentage of progressives oppose any recognition of the reality that men and women are different. But conservatives and feminists are championing the normal view that women and men are different, Sullivan wrote:Pol
It might be a sign of the end-times, or simply a function of our currently scrambled politics, but [in late January], four feminist activists — three from a self-described radical feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front — appeared on a panel at the Heritage Foundation. Together they argued that sex was fundamentally biological, and not socially constructed, and that there is a difference between women and trans women that needs to be respected. For this, they were given a rousing round of applause by the Trump supporters, religious-right members, natural law theorists, and conservative intellectuals who comprised much of the crowd. If you think I’ve just discovered an extremely potent strain of weed and am hallucinating, check out the video of the event.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say are entitled to women’s’ rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug-companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.","['attacked', 'gender', 'identity', 'cracked']"
"However, the GOP tax cuts benefited small business and the middle class — not just the wealthy, as several Democrat candidates have suggested.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/20/amy-klobuchar-implies-trump-tax-cuts-didnt-really-help-middle-class/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,77.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Claim: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said during Wednesday evening’s Democrat debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, that President Trump’s tax cuts benefited the wealthy while implying it did not significantly help middle class Americans such as “the hard-working people in Nevada.”
Verdict: False. The GOP tax cuts helped Americans — and small businesses — across the board.
Klobuchar, who reportedly finished the night with the second-most speaking time, suggested during the debate that the tax cut legislation President Trump signed in 2017 mainly benefited his wealthy friends.
Klobuchar said:
And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and — let’s just talk about Donald Trump, because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy, and he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, “You just got a lot richer.” That is Exhibit A.
“And I can tell you, the hard-working people in Nevada were not in that room. So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone,” she said, attempting to distance herself from her more radical opponents.
However, the GOP tax cuts benefited small business and the middle class — not just the wealthy, as several Democrat candidates have suggested.
As Breitbart News has explicitly detailed, the majority of American middle class households, 82 percent, “received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260.” An even greater majority, 90 percent, have experienced an increase in take-home pay, and the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate also brought additional relief to many middle class Americans across the board.
Additionally, as Trump’s campaign pointed out, the tax cuts law also “doubled the child tax credit for parents while expanding its eligibility, putting more money in families’ pockets.”
Small businesses have also reaped great benefits. A Gallup poll released this month showed that the majority of small businesses, 69 percent, said they have benefited from the tax cuts the president signed into law in 2017. Americans for Tax Reform has documented hundreds of examples of businesses hiring more employees and issuing “pay raises, benefit increases, facility expansions, bonuses, and utility rate reductions where the GOP-enacted Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was cited as a key factor.”
While Democrat presidential hopefuls aim to weaponize the tax cuts, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview in January that it is precisely what will assist Trump in making his case to the American people.
As Breitbart News reported:
“We played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there,” she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced. “They said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it’s exactly what they’ve done,” she explained. “I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they’ve hired.” When asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders’ socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners. In one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees. That was a “direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” she said.
This is far from the first time Klobuchar has dismissed Trump’s tax cuts.
“My message is, ‘What’s been happening to you since this guy’s gotten in office?” Klobuchar said during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe last year. “Has that tax bill really helped you that much? No. Most of it went to help the wealthiest.”","['wealthy', 'benefited']"

VERDICT: False. Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy has led to record-low unemployment for the bottom-tier of working and middle-class Americans, as well as major wage hikes thanks to a tightened labor market.
“We’re going to force this president to stand up on that debate stage next to somebody who actually lives in a middle-class neighborhood,” Buttigieg said. “In the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he tends to speak for but turns his back on.”
In fact, the South Bend-Mishawaka metropolitan area has continued to see a drop in unemployment and job gains as part of Trump’s economic nationalist agenda.
Since Trump became president, the South Bend metro area has enjoyed an unemployment rate that has never exceeded 4.6 percent, and which has dropped as low as 3.2 percent — sometimes lower than the national unemployment rate.
Likewise, some of the forgotten working and middle-class populations — those who have suffered from wage stagnation for decades — have secured wage increases thanks to Trump’s policies. This week, the New York Times admitted that black Americans’ wages are “finally rising” after a “decade of stagnation.”
Working-class Americans, like those who make up the majority of South Bend residents, have secured the largest wage hikes in the nation compared to all other economic demographic groups — a direct result of Trump tightening the labor market.

A user responding to Cleese wrote “The poor British, unmanned, disarmed and proud of it. Yikes.”
Cleese reacted, saying “I think the British are proud that they DON’T need a gun to make themselves feel manly. And they would feel sympathy for any males suffering from feelings of inadequacy because they don’t own a gun. So…keep your pecker up, Brad. Remember, assault weapons keep ED away.”

Another individual tweeted Cleese a question: “How are the stabbings in London of late?”
Cleese’s response: “Glad to report that few of them are done with guns.”
Of course, a person stabbed to death is dead, whether a gun was used or not. Just as a person run over by a terrorist driving a truck are dead, whether a gun was used or not.
On January 4, 2020, Breitbart News reported the number of people murdered in London has reached its highest level in a decade under the leadership of Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Moreover, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Cleveland are among the U.S. cities freeing hundreds of inmates from prison in response to the deadly coronavirus. How else would John Cleese have innocent Americans protect themselves from potential danger as a result of newly freed criminals being freed from prison?
On June 3, 2017, Breitbart News reported on terrorists in a rented van who drove into crowds on London Bridge, before exiting the vehicle to stab startled Londoners. The AP reported the “attack…left eight people dead and nearly 50 people injured.” Moreover, “It was the third such deadly attack in Britain in three months.”
Ironically, the attack was ended because armed police shot the perpetrators. And such justifiable use of firearms is vastly unreported in the United States every day, where it occurs not simply at the hands of police, but of armed citizens protecting their lives and the lives of their families.
On February 19, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Florida State criminology professor Gary Kleck affirmed that his 20-plus years of academic findings showing at least 760,000 defensive gun uses a year had yet to be refuted. People have mocked his findings, and leftists professors and gun control groups have tried to counter them, but no one has provided empirical evidence to refute them.
Kleck’s numbers were first published in 1993, and he defended them in 1997, 1998, and 2001, then again in 2015, when Politico published investment counselors Evan DeFilippis and Devin Hughes’ claims that defensive gun uses were part of “myth.”
On average, there are 11,000-12,000 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. each year. Gun controllers report numbers closer to 38,000-39,000 a year because they add firearm related suicides to actual homicides, thereby swelling the number of “gun violence” deaths. Even then, the columns are quite slanted, in that one shows 38,000 “gun violence” deaths while the other shows a minimum of 760,000 defensive gun uses.
And if we look at a subset of guns which the left loves to deride-rifles, for instance—the a clearer picture about gun deaths is quickly visible.
On September 6, 2019, Breitbart News reported roughly 1.1 deaths by rifle a day in the U.S. in 2017. But there were 1.27 deaths a day from hammers and other blunt objects, 2.7 deaths a day from bicycles, four deaths a day via knives and other sharp instruments, and 16 deaths a day occurred simply during the act of crossing the street.
Perhaps it was the ready accessibility of these facts that led Page Six to report that Cleese was “fish-slapped” over the derisive comments he made about Americans and their guns.

"During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/07/25/plan-emerges-nevertrump-primary-trump-2020/,breitbart,trump-presidency,right,78.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The movement known as NeverTrump — self-identified conservatives who vowed never to vote for Donald Trump, even at the price of a Hillary Clinton presidency and liberal dominance of the Supreme Court for generations — did not take long to recover from the shock of Trump’s victory in November.
Indeed, NeverTrump joined the media and Democrats in hyping the Russia conspiracy theory, and continues to mock those who dare to support the president.
The self-flattering conceit that sustains NeverTrump’s criticism is that Trump supporters are participating in a cult of personality. Never mind the fact that some of Trump’s strongest supporters have had no problem whatsoever in criticizing him for substantive reasons — as in the backlash against his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. NeverTrumpers still believe themselves to be the unique guardians of conservative orthodoxy and honest punditry.
They find a welcome audience in the mainstream media, which has always been willing to give a platform to those conservatives willing to bash other conservatives. (They deny that this is the game they are playing, because they maintain that Trump is not a real conservative, though he has governed as the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan.) They say they praise Trump when he deserves it — though they clearly savor the criticism more.
During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge. NeverTrumpers imagined they would be the last conservatives standing atop the rubble of the movement, able to set the agenda and the boundaries. After the election, most ignored calls for reconciliation.
Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.
The path ahead is a conservative primary challenge to Trump in 2020, and the foundations are being laid now.
For such a challenge to be successful, NeverTrump would have to coalesce around only one candidate — and not to persist, as it did throughout the 2016 primary, with a divided field of contenders. Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters.
The case NeverTrump and its candidate will have to make is that while they are grateful (ahem) for Trump’s success in defeating Hillary Clinton, most of his other achievements for the cause could have been done by any Republican president, and few other Republicans would come with Trump’s disadvantages. They have to hope that Democrats continue to flounder, so that a primary challenge would not seem a threat to the GOP’s 2020 prospects as a whole.
The biggest problem for NeverTrump, however, is the pitiful performance of the Republican Congress, which has been unable to act on its core priorities, and reinforces the notion that only Trump is strong enough to lead the party.
Nevertheless, NeverTrump sees in the 2020 race a reason to persist. It will continue to cast its fight as a principled one. Much of it, however, is about power and revenge. Apparently, NeverTrump cannot forgive Trump for winning.

"American manufacturing jobs have boomed to a more than 20-year high as President Trump has imposed a wide range of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and Chinese products — dooming predictions made by free traders that have yet to pan out.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/04/free-traders-prediction-of-tariff-doom-fails-as-u-s-manufacturing-booms/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,78.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"American manufacturing jobs have boomed to a more than 20-year high as President Trump has imposed a wide range of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and Chinese products — dooming predictions made by free traders that have yet to pan out.
U.S. manufacturers added 284,000 jobs in the last year, the most jobs added in the sector in a single year since 1997, as Breitbart News’s Economics Editor John Carney notes. In December 2018, alone, about 32,000 factory jobs were created.
American manufacturing is vital to the prosperity of communities, as every one manufacturing job supports about 3.6 American jobs in other sectors of industry.
The U.S. manufacturing jobs boom comes as free trade economists, billionaire donors, and establishment media pundits have routinely claimed that Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported steel and ten percent tariff on aluminum would cripple the American economy.
They said Trump's promise to bring back manufacturing jobs was a ""con,"" told us we were dupes for believing in a manufacturing revival. It just couldn't be done. It was impossible. But we're America. The impossible country. So we did it anyway.https://t.co/GnWXcDCq0P pic.twitter.com/Kp3TAGJ1dB — John Carney (@carney) January 4, 2019
In November 2018, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer claiming that Trump’s tariffs on imported products “endangers the jobs of millions of workers” in industries that have grown to rely on cheap foreign imports.
Months ago, the chairman of Cummins, a fortune 500 company, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times claiming that even short-term tariffs would cripple American industry.
“We see no upside in the implementation of tariffs,” Cummins Chairman Tom Linebarger wrote. “They are a tax, and the risky proposition of entering a trade war could slow down the economy. Even putting up short-term barriers with trading partners in China and Europe can cause long-term losses in market share, resulting in lost jobs in the United States.”
The free traders at the Tax Foundation wrote their research predicted that not only would Trump’s tariffs crush American industries, but they would also decrease Americans’ wages.
“These tariffs increase production costs for U.S. manufacturers, placing them at a competitive disadvantage, and will, on net, destroy more output, wages, and employment in the United States than they create,” Tax Foundation analysts wrote.
For U.S. wages, the opposite has panned out. In December, Americans’ wages grew 3.2 percent in December 2018 compared to last year.
The conservative Heritage Foundation called Trump’s tariffs “ineffective and dangerous,” elected Republicans have called the tariffs “dumb,” and pro-free trade Trade Partnership claimed that the tariffs would eliminate 146,000 American jobs, a claim that has yet to come to fruition.
Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul credited Trump’s tariffs for the economic boom in U.S. manufacturing, telling Breitbart News in a statement:
December was another great month for manufacturing. With 32,000 new jobs last month, tough action against trade cheats is helping create new jobs for American workers. [Emphasis added]
Paul said the new Democrat-Republican split Congress should now focus its attention on a massive infrastructure investment to continue driving American manufacturing and job creation.
“With more manufacturing jobs, communities throughout the country grow,” Paul said.
As Breitbart News has extensively reported, between 2001 and 2017, the U.S.-China trade deficit was responsible for the loss of 3.4 million American jobs. The vast majority of jobs lost from free trade with China have been in the U.S. manufacturing sector, making up 74.4 percent of all jobs lost and amounting to 2.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost. This total of jobs lost also includes the 1.3 million American jobs lost since 2008.",['dooming']

Although few could have known it then, Limbaugh seems to have been the voice calling out in the wilderness, preparing America for a Trump presidency. As America came to love Limbaugh, it would soon come to love Trump. Here are four ways Limbaugh paved Trump’s way to the White House.
1. Not Accepting the DC Elite’s Excuses
When Republican lawmakers had every excuse for not defeating or repealing Obamacare after promising to do so for a decade, Limbaugh wasn’t hearing any of it. “In the past, we’ve gotten lip service…but if you listen carefully, you’ll hear them say, ‘Well we actually can’t. Yeah, we want to repeal it, but it would be very tough to do, and besides, we can’t really do it until we get the White House back…’”
Limbaugh called these excuses out for what they were: a smokescreen for thwarting the will of the people. In some cases, that’s even meant Limbaugh not taking excuses from Trump himself. When Trump signed the massive omnibus spending bill in 2018, Limbaugh gave the president flak for it. Both men see that Washington’s “business as usual” has done little for the average American, so both balk at the ways of Washington’s deep state elite.
2. Bringing Big Ideas Home for Average Americans
When Limbaugh first went on the air 32 years ago, it was unheard of that a conservative commentator would fill three hours of air time with few phone calls and almost no guests. Instead, it was just one guy with a microphone, an opinion and guts.
People were transfixed. Limbaugh educated a generation of casually conservative voters about the fundamental principles and concepts behind their beliefs. Especially to Boomers, he took conservative principles out of the Buckley-esque ivory tower and put them where they mattered: in their daily lives.
While no one is praising Trump as a thought leader in the way Limbaugh has been, he’s undeniably made conservative ideas tangible for average Americans. In the chants “Lock her up” or “Build a wall,” he may not be quoting Cato, but he’s making a connection between policy and Americans’ everyday lives.
3. Cutting Through B.S. with Surgical Accuracy
If Limbaugh and Trump shared a mantra, it would be, “Sorry, not sorry.” They call them like they see them and don’t flinch. One of Limbaugh’s signature moves is taking down opposing opinions with both bravado and merciless logic. Sure, he might dress down a liberal caller as a “cheap bastard,” but not without eloquently explaining why his argument on the minimum wage is wrong.
Long before the Trump “Access Hollywood” tape was a gleam in CNN’s eye, the liberal media jumped on Limbaugh in 2012 for calling a female law student a “slut” and “prostitute” for advocating for employer-funded birth control. While Limbaugh did apologize for the personal insults, he stood by the nerve he struck.
Americans heard the left arguing that unlimited birth control, paid for by taxpayers, is a fundamental right. As he does, Rush called B.S., and his fans cheered. Such a masterful takedown would not be seen again until the 2016 election, when Donald Trump called nonsense on Elizabeth Warren’s bogus Native American heritage, dubbing her “Pocahontas.”
4. Reassuring Americans Their Values Are Worth Upholding
Like Trump, sadly Limbaugh’s private life sometimes runs counter to conservative ideals. He’s been married multiple times. He came out publicly about his addiction to prescription painkillers in 2003, struggling for several years after with relapses, drug charges, and stints in rehab. Still, his audience was fiercely loyal.
In both Limbaugh and Trump’s cases, their public has forgiven them sins that would have destroyed many others. In fact, many choir boys rush to their defense. Why? Because they are a powerful voice that defends their audience’s right to believe as they do and not be judged for it.
In a too-perfect example, comedian Al Franken once wrote a book titled “Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot.” It’s true that Franken eventually became a senator, but both Limbaugh and Franken have faced very public accusations of sexism. Today, only one of them still has a successful public career—and it’s not Franken.
Ultimately, Limbaugh and Trump are loved and hated for the same reason: because they’re successful. Limbaugh revolutionized talk radio and spawned a generation of fierce conservatives.
Some people hate Trump and mock everything from his geography gaffes to his appearance. They’ve done the same thing with Rush. All of this mockery and vitriol is just an attempt to thwart their real success in revolutionizing American culture and politics. But just as Limbaugh has succeeded, so will Trump—because they, not their adversaries, understand what makes America tick.","['undeniably', 'tangible']"
Billionaire Democrat presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg is a staunch proponent of gun control for America with one caveat–he gets to spend his days surrounded by good guys with guns to keep him safe.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/03/bloomberg-enjoys-armed-guards-while-fighting-disarm-americans/,breitbart,gun-control,right,78.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Billionaire Democrat presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg is a staunch proponent of gun control for America with one caveat–he gets to spend his days surrounded by good guys with guns to keep him safe.
Bloomberg’s use of armed guards has been seized upon again and again by gun rights supporters through the years. They point to the guards in an attempt to show his habit of pushing laws that would deny self-defense tools to poor families while allowing Bloomberg to benefit from being protected by men with firearms.
In 2017 Fox News’ Tucker Carlson pointed out the hypocrisy of Bloomberg’s actions.
The New York Post reported on Bloomberg referring to the NYPD as his “own army,” while Mayor of New York City. And on January 25, 2019, NRA-ILA reported that after his tenure as mayor ended “Bloomberg hired some of the same [NYPD] officers from his security detail to work for him privately.” Yet he continued to push gun control for average Americans.
His belief that gun ownership is esoteric was clear after the December 29, 2019, Texas church attack, which ended seconds after it began because an armed congregant took the attacker out. Even after the live-saving benefit of the armed congregant was put on display for all the world to see, Bloomberg responded by claiming only law enforcement, not congregants, should be armed.
Texas church hero Jack Wilson responded by pointing out that if Bloomberg’s gun control had been in place the congregants would have been unarmed and at the mercy of the attacker. As a result, more lives would have been lost.
In more general terms, universal background checks are arguably the most prominent piece of legislation in Bloomberg’s gun control portfolio. Yet Crime Prevention Research president John R. Lott has shown that states that adopted such checks “experienced a 15 percent increase in per capita rates of mass public shooting fatalities.” Those states also witnessed “a 38 percent increase in the rate of injury from [the mass public shootings].”
But Bloomberg moves through life surrounded by good guys with guns; by men who are armed to be sure he is safe as he goes about his daily business.

However, despite the Democrats’ claim, an overwhelming majority of Americans received a tax cut through the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Eighty-two percent of American middle-class households received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260. In Ohio, where CNN is hosting the debate, the average Ohioan received $1,476. Ninety percent of Americans saw an increase in take-home pay. The tax cuts3.3% raise wage growth by 3.3 percent and helped foster historic lows in unemployment.
The Trump tax cuts also doubled the child tax credit and expanded its eligibility, which greatly helps the American working-class family.

Further, the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also repealed the Obamacare individual mandate, which serves as a giant middle-class tax cut. Eighty percent of those who paid the Obamacare individual mandate fine made less than $50,000, making the mandate’s repeal a significant tax cut.","['greatly', 'helps']"
"Ultimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They’re bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/12/new-york-times-needs-get-white-supremacy-fetish/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,78.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait like an article arguing white supremacists have an Asian woman fetish.
We used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times, we know it’s just another sinister tool of white supremacy.
Over the past few years, it seems like every week our media-academia complex discovers a new addition to the list of “things that seem completely innocuous but are actually white supremacist.” In recent months, for example, we’ve learned that math, logic, and even square dancing are “weapon[s] of white supremacy.” (You should feel a pang of guilt for every time you do-si-doed in elementary school.)
Here’s their latest hot take: in a recent essay for the New York Times Sunday Review, journalist Audrea Lim argues that “the white supremacists on the far right have ‘yellow fever’ — an Asian woman fetish.” Her evidence boils down to a few anecdotes about the worst-of-the-worst of white nationalism: perennial idiot Richard Spencer thinks Asian girls are “cute” and “smart,” Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin went to a shopping mall with his Filipina girlfriend, and Asian-American porn star Tila Tequila once did a Nazi salute.
To bolster her argument with historical context, Lim even includes a direct quote from Adolf Hitler expressing his admiration for the civilizations of China and Japan. Pro tip: when you’re quoting Hitler, you’re losing the argument.
How About Providing Some Evidence For Those Claims
Certainly, there is a stock character in American life of the lonely, socially awkward, middle-aged white man who wants a “submissive Asian wife.” A feature-length PBS documentary even follows one of these sad sacks in his quest to find a mail-order bride from China. It’s pathetic and trades in racial stereotypes, but that hardly makes it “white supremacist.” In fact, Lim provides no evidence that this phenomenon is even unique to white men, which begs the question: is it really true that white men have an “Asian fetish”?
Lim doesn’t say, but thankfully, we can find detailed statistical information through a simple Google search. According to research by the dating site OkCupid, American men of all racial backgrounds find Asian women highly attractive. In fact, Asian-American women are the only racial group to score net positive ratings from men of all ethnic groups.
If you think about it, Lim’s argument is bizarre. If someone told me Italians were the most handsome, creative, and intelligent people in the world, I would click my heels, praise their good sense, and go about my day. But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success.
More deeply, however, Lim’s argument is that the very idea that Asians are “civilized, advanced and highly intelligent … [has] roots in white supremacy.” Really? I worked as a journalist in China for more than a year, and it was clear to me that the Chinese think of themselves as civilized, advanced, and highly intelligent. If anything, it’s a self-identity that has been accepted, not invented, by the West.
Furthermore, in America, that positive image is a factual reality. Asian-Americans have higher median income and education levels than any other racial group does. Contra Lim, Asian-Americans are not a “model minority,” they’re model citizens with strong family bonds, high educational attainment, and high economic productivity. There’s nothing wrong with that — in fact, it’s a major accomplishment to celebrate.
This Argument Ends In Banning Interracial Marriage
Unfortunately, while the essay sets up the premise that white supremacy lurks at the heart of the relationships between white men and Asian women, it fails to deliver a conclusion. I’ll fill it in for you. If we take Lim’s argument to its logical end (and reject the idea that logic itself is “white supremacist”), maybe she’s suggesting that white men who marry Asian women are, in the language of the sociological literature, “colonizing their bodies.”
Or maybe white men are simply using their privilege as the progenitors of global beauty standards to extend their patriarchal dominance over a favored minority race. Or, to read into Lim’s ominous invocation of Hitler, maybe it’s all a secret plot to resurrect the Axis alliance between the great European and Asian powers. Of course, the author doesn’t go this far — her essay is ridiculous enough — but there’s no way you can accept her premise without concluding at the very least that interracial marriage between white men and Asian women is somehow wrong.
I take this insinuation personally. I’m a white man married to an Asian-American woman. We have two children together. Like the civil rights leaders in the 1960s, I believe interracial marriage is a sign of social progress. At its best, marriage is about human love, which transcends all considerations of race, class, and identity. One might even consider it to be the fullest expression of the idea of e pluribus unum, which I support by any means necessary — through assimilation, marriage, and the bonds of mutual citizenship.
While there may be awkward moments as we traverse the boundaries of ethnic identity, I believe that interracial marriage makes us stronger as a nation and will slowly help stamp out the real racism that still exists in America. Rather than conflate interracial marriage with the poisonous ideology of white supremacy, we should celebrate it as it’s practiced by millions of Americans: as an expression of love, unity, and tolerance.
Articles Like This Make Everything Worse
Ultimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They’re bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them. They’re a miniscule fraction of the population — numbering in the thousands in a nation of 323 million — and deserve to be snubbed out of public life.
Sadly, articles like “white supremacists have an Asian fetish” are counterproductive, bringing them even greater attention and trivializing the real legacy of white supremacy, the original sin of American history. The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater editorial discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait. In the past year, the Times has published articles about a white supremacist’s wedding registry, whether black and white preschoolers can really be friends, and how “nachos” and “Nazi” share the same etymological origin. The coverage has been so over-the-top, you might even say The New York Times has a “white supremacy fetish.”
Luckily, America is moving forward, with or without the Times. Interracial marriage is a fast-rising trend and leading to broader social tolerance. The percentage of multiracial children born in the United States has increased from 1 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 2013. The social taboos against racial mixing have begun to fade and a majority of multiracial Americans are proud of their blended heritage and more open to other cultures.
On a final note of optimism: mixed-race people are actually seen as the most attractive of all racial types. Thus, if this trend continues, we may soon be able to say objectively that America has the most beautiful people in the world. That’s something worth fighting for.","['cartoon', 'villains', 'bigots', 'losers', 'and', 'attention-seekers']"
"Instead of giving way to despair, Christians should master themselves, strive for virtue, and suffer with dignity. The virus and shutdowns, grave as they are, will pass, but everyone can learn from them and be more than members of the passive herd beholden to external forces.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/01/coronavirus-friendship-collapse-shows-why-we-need-christian-epicureanism/,federalist,coronavirus,right,78.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"What does Christian Epicureanism afford the modern Christian living through a pandemic? It offers the very things necessary to recover: friendship and peace.
Even as various states reopen, the panic and concern over COVID-19 remain high. People worry about new outbreaks occurring, as some experts predict, while others stay home afraid despite loosening restrictions.
Others worry about harm done already by the shutdowns. Many businesses have closed permanently, and a record number of people are unemployed. Additionally, many hospitals have halted nonemergency procedures, and untold numbers of people with non-COVID ailments must forego treatment.
In such a time, it is ideal to adopt the Stoic philosophy to successfully cope with the tribulations and keep one’s sanity. As Michael Warren Davis argues in a recent essay, “More than Christian virologists or economists or social workers, we need Christian Stoics.” Instead of giving way to despair, Christians should master themselves, strive for virtue, and suffer with dignity. The virus and shutdowns, grave as they are, will pass, but everyone can learn from them and be more than members of the passive herd beholden to external forces.
By contrast, very few Christians or conservatives would recommend Epicureanism, the rivaling philosophy to Stoicism. With its supposed emphasis on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, Epicureanism seems poorly suited to meet the challenges of the Wuhan virus. In most people’s minds, today’s Epicureans are the careless young people flocking to the beach to enjoy a prolonged spring break, or else they are the lazy couch potatoes, relishing their unemployment checks and happily taking in the popular idea that their binge-watching is saving lives.
In truth, these examples are caricatures of Epicureanism. Epicureanism is not hedonism; rather, it abhors lack of restraint and shameless debauchery. After all, these things bring more pain than pleasure.
What is True Epicureanism?
The true Epicurean leads an ascetic life, one of material detachment and personal self-sufficiency. He resembles more the Buddhist monk who saw life as suffering than the heedless Romantic chasing moments of sensual ecstasy. Even as he criticizes Epicureanism on the whole, Roger Kimball concedes, “Epicureanism is a deeply ascetic philosophy. It preaches the gospel of pleasure. But it defines pleasure in such a way that no hedonist worth his salt would embrace it.”
Where Kimball and many others find fault is in the shallow materialist mindset of Epicureanism. The Epicurean had to convince himself that death was a return to nothingness. His soul and body would eventually dissolve, and no god would take much notice of it.
To be fair, the Epicurean account of death matches the Stoic’s account. While the Stoic may not have gone so far as to conclude that all life is mere matter, he did think of death as a kind of nothingness. Pondering death, the Roman Stoic Seneca blithely remarked in a letter, “Death is just not being. … It will be the same after me as before me.” To correct this mistake in both philosophies requires the light of Christian revelation, which promises a heavenly reward that awaits those who follow God’s commands, not a return to nonexistence.
People Need Friendship
All this said, what does Epicureanism, or Christian Epicureanism, afford the modern Christian living through a pandemic? It offers the very things necessary to recover: friendship and peace.
Dr. John Rist writes in the journal “Classical Philology” that all men “desire the peace and blessedness of the gods; and, for Epicurus, the most efficacious means of attaining that goal is available through friendship.” While Epicureans handled the pains of life, particularly the natural fears of death, through “right doctrine,” they also sought out companions with whom to share their pleasures and alleviate hardship.
At a time when organizations and governments call on their people to socially distance and wear masks, the willingness to trust others and cultivate friendship is lower than usual. Even some Christians have come to regard their fellow believers more as potential carriers of the virus than companions seeking common goodness and truth. Once churches reopen, it will be difficult to abandon this view.
To make matters worse, even before the pandemic, many Christian communities suffered from the lack of association between members. In the last few decades, many people have come to see church as a distributor of the sacraments and a source of wholesome uncontroversial teachings, neglecting to see it as a space to form strong friendships within the context of spiritual life. As such, many churches are not really bodies of believers anymore, but charitable organizations with generic norms and practices. While Christ told his disciples, “I call you friends,” too many Christians today do not call each other anything.
Christian Epicureanism Joins the Physical and Spiritual
An Epicurean mindset could address this problem by restoring an appreciation of the physical world. The encroachments of virtual reality along with COVID-19 countermeasures have caused most Christians to retreat ever further into their own minds and screens. Spiritual and material health, however, depend on life lived in the world outside. The Christian should interact with others, form personal bonds, and experience true pleasure from worshiping with friends.
Coupled with the Epicurean injunction to seek the pleasurable and enjoy what Epicurus himself called the “immortal good” of friendship, Christians should practice the theological virtue of hope. Kimball is right to criticize the inadequacy of Epicurean materialism to account for suffering and death: “[W]hat one resents about death is not the simple absence of sense experience but the loss of the world: one’s friends, engagements, duties, involvements, as well as the panoply of sense experience that attends living.”
If the physical world is all that exists, ignoring the absolute pain and loss that inevitably occur is impossible. A Stoic might at least see this as occasion for virtue and character-building; an Epicurean has to pretend it doesn’t affect him.
The Christian Epicurean, however, can hope in God’s mercy, which makes the crosses of life bearable. Furthermore, hope in a loving God can strengthen friendships between those who share that hope. Not only do Christians look to one another for comfort and support, they can also look to God together. Friendship and faith reinforce one another to make a believer more alive.
As this interaction of faith and friendship enlivens individuals, it also invigorates the Christian community. People certainly need the sacraments, but they also need one another. The time apart has made this more evident.
By all means, let Christian Stoics show virtue in the face of adversity, but let them do this as moderately, outwardly, and joyfully as Christian Epicureans.","['passive', 'herd', 'suffer', 'with', 'dignity']"

This rejection of male-and-female society — including singles, parents, and children — is now the norm in the new Democratic Party, which has embraced the transgender ideology.
That ideology says each persons’ preferences are — and should be — unconnected from their bodies. It says that men and women are interchangeable, and can switch their sex by switching their own sense of “gender identity” so that men who say they are women really do become biological women, complete with female penises.
Also, progressives want the government to clear away the “social construction” — laws and civic norms — which supposedly prevent small women from wrestling large men to the ground, and which deter large men in tutus from trying to Jette far above tall female dancers.
For Democrats, this wave or new regulation, censorship, and civic pressure will free the less-than-one-percent of people who say they are transgender from the oppressive, outdated rules of male-dominated supremacy. People will discard the oppressive “gender binary” of male or female sexes and will embrace the freedom of new “genders” — transgender, bi-gender, non-conforming, etc, etc, etc., progressives say.

In contrast, conservatives say that men and women are legally equal, but their bodies give them different and complementary skills, abilities, and preferences. For example, conservatives point out that men tend to be stronger and will aggressively compete against other men to support their wives and children, while women have the remarkable ability to grow babies and moderate male aggression. Teenage boys and girls also compete and cooperate among themselves in their very different ways, while also finding much time to cooperate across the sexual divide.
Conservatives also point out that transgenderism requires intense government regulation of society to prevent women from ejecting men from their showers and bathrooms, to stop girls complaining when teenage boys run away with the sports titles, and to block female students when scholarships for women go to men.
Rep. Jayapal (and nearly all Dems.) feels Congress must tightly regulate all 330M Americans to ensure ""freedom"" for the less-than-1% of people who wish to switch their sex.

Democrats are fast discarding this ancient understanding of the two sexes.
On March 28, for example, nearly all House Democrats — including Ocasio-Cortez — backed a resolution calling on the Pentagon to recruit “transgender” people who openly insist they are members of the opposite sex.
Whereas President Trump’s ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces would affect all transgender members of the Armed Forces and force them to serve under a policy that stigmatizes and devalues their contributions to our Nation’s defense: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That at the House of Representatives— (1) strongly opposes President Trump’s discriminatory ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces; (2) rejects the flawed scientific and medical claims upon which it is based; and (3) strongly urges the Department of Defense to not reinstate President Trump’s ban on transgender members of the Armed Forces and to maintain an inclusive policy allowing qualified transgender Americans to enlist and serve in the Armed Forces.
Only one Republican denounced the contents of the resolution, Missouri Rep. Vickey Hartzler.
In contrast, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and other Democrats lashed at the GOP. The Pentagon’s decision to define soldiers’ sex by their biology “is an act of cruelty … [and] bigoted,” said Pelosi. It “violates every value of American democracy … [it]would undermine our military readiness … [it is] prejudice, not patriotism … We will never allow hate and prejudice to dictate our national security,” Pelosi said.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, former President Barack Obama told National Public Radio that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are members of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by his feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, as well as progressives, plus feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women’s rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In February, for example, an Ohio judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she could begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that would allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K–12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in child-rearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.","['oppressive', 'outdated', 'male-dominated', 'supremacy']"

However, the number of hate crimes has increased in the US in recent years. This shows that US social conflicts are rising and the problem of racial discrimination is especially serious. The El Paso shooting has worsened fears of the increasing white supremacist threat in the North American country. More importantly, although US President Donald Trump called the El Paso shooting a “hateful act” on Twitter, he has not yet recognized the seriousness of the white supremacist problem. What’s worse, white nationalism is deeply rooted in Trump’s mind. This can be seen from his attitude toward immigration, his insistence on building a border wall and his racist tweets. Instead of resolving the problem, he is even inciting white American people’s hatred.
The astute observer will note that China is not exactly eager to take in large numbers of migrants or refugees from beyond its borders. China takes border security very seriously, especially for the parts of its border that occasionally move further away from Beijing, deploys hardcore nationalist political themes on a daily basis, and is not gentle with minority populations or respectful of their beliefs.
One area where Communist China cannot be accused of hypocrisy is its advocacy of stricter gun control. The Global Times declared the U.S. “urgently needs gun control,” although it acknowledged that “if the shooters’ hatred is not eliminated, they can still use other weapons to vent their anger on innocent people.”
China’s state-run Xinhua news service published a lengthy article advocating gun control on Monday, quoting U.S. advocates who claim the “ubiquitousness of guns is the ‘prime problem’ behind gun violence” and calling for “stricter background checks.”
Xinhua found the political future of gun control in America uncertain, even after the weekend shootings:
Gun control is simply not on most voters’ radars in the lead-up to the 2020 elections, TV news personality and Republican strategist Ford O’Connell told Xinhua. Polls that are conducted soon after the mass shooting tend to show an uptick in the number of Americans that believe gun control is a major issue, but those numbers significantly lessen once the shootings are gone from the news cycle. Generally, only a small percentage of Americans view gun control as a major issue, while healthcare, jobs, and immigration top the list of voters’ priorities. Although the Democrats may introduce bills on a national level, experts said they will not go far in a divided Congress. Instead, the United States is more likely to see laws enacted on a state level rather than on a national level, O’Connell said, adding that the gun control issue will not decide the 2020 election.
Xinhua concluded by quoting the prediction of Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Darrell West that “gun violence is unlikely to change until Democrats hold the House, Senate, and the White House” because “most GOP lawmakers fail to take action because their constituents favor gun rights.”","['migrants', 'refugees']"
The self-flattering conceit that sustains NeverTrump’s criticism is that Trump supporters are participating in a cult of personality. ,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/07/25/plan-emerges-nevertrump-primary-trump-2020/,breitbart,trump-presidency,right,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The movement known as NeverTrump — self-identified conservatives who vowed never to vote for Donald Trump, even at the price of a Hillary Clinton presidency and liberal dominance of the Supreme Court for generations — did not take long to recover from the shock of Trump’s victory in November.
Indeed, NeverTrump joined the media and Democrats in hyping the Russia conspiracy theory, and continues to mock those who dare to support the president.
The self-flattering conceit that sustains NeverTrump’s criticism is that Trump supporters are participating in a cult of personality. Never mind the fact that some of Trump’s strongest supporters have had no problem whatsoever in criticizing him for substantive reasons — as in the backlash against his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. NeverTrumpers still believe themselves to be the unique guardians of conservative orthodoxy and honest punditry.
They find a welcome audience in the mainstream media, which has always been willing to give a platform to those conservatives willing to bash other conservatives. (They deny that this is the game they are playing, because they maintain that Trump is not a real conservative, though he has governed as the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan.) They say they praise Trump when he deserves it — though they clearly savor the criticism more.
During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge. NeverTrumpers imagined they would be the last conservatives standing atop the rubble of the movement, able to set the agenda and the boundaries. After the election, most ignored calls for reconciliation.
Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.
The path ahead is a conservative primary challenge to Trump in 2020, and the foundations are being laid now.
For such a challenge to be successful, NeverTrump would have to coalesce around only one candidate — and not to persist, as it did throughout the 2016 primary, with a divided field of contenders. Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters.
The case NeverTrump and its candidate will have to make is that while they are grateful (ahem) for Trump’s success in defeating Hillary Clinton, most of his other achievements for the cause could have been done by any Republican president, and few other Republicans would come with Trump’s disadvantages. They have to hope that Democrats continue to flounder, so that a primary challenge would not seem a threat to the GOP’s 2020 prospects as a whole.
The biggest problem for NeverTrump, however, is the pitiful performance of the Republican Congress, which has been unable to act on its core priorities, and reinforces the notion that only Trump is strong enough to lead the party.
Nevertheless, NeverTrump sees in the 2020 race a reason to persist. It will continue to cast its fight as a principled one. Much of it, however, is about power and revenge. Apparently, NeverTrump cannot forgive Trump for winning.

"However, this is not the senator’s first time criticizing Bannon based off of misleading reports in the media.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/03/29/menendez-to-aipac-steve-bannon-a-white-nationalist/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) took aim at President Donald Trump Chief White House Strategist Stephen K. Bannon on Tuesday, falsely claiming that “white nationalist dog whistles” were being “blown by Steve Bannon in the West Wing.”
“Whether it is the delegitimization of Israel by the United Nations, the intimidation, and isolation promoted by BDS, or the white nationalist dog whistles blown by Steve Bannon in the West Wing, it is up to all of us to stand up, to stand together and speak out against antisemitism in all of its forms,” Menendez said at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Conference (AIPAC) Tuesday morning. “And that includes raising our voices together in rejecting antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia.”
Bannon, who previously served as Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, has denied the false claims spewed against him mostly by those on the left. “I’m not a white nationalist, I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist,” Bannon told Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter last November. He similarly told Kimberly A. Strassel of the Wall Street Journal: “I’ve never been a supporter of ethno-nationalism.”
In that same article, he made it clear that both he and Breitbart News had “zero tolerance” for “racial and anti-Semitic” elements that are found in the alt-right movement.
Menenedez, who was indicted by the Obama administration on corruption and bribery charges after he was critical of the Iran nuclear deal, delivered the above remarks while making at speech against the antisemitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement which targets the Jewish State Israel. At one point during his talk, he noted, “We must stand together to ensure that the letters BDS are seen for what they are: Bias Directed Solely at one people and one country by those who should know better.”
However, this is not the senator’s first time criticizing Bannon based off of misleading reports in the media. Following Bannon’s appointment to Trump’s team last November, Menendez said on Facebook that his constituents are upset and “frightened that someone who has promoted hateful, bigoted rhetoric and radical ideas through his website has been elevated to such a powerful role inside the White House. Hate has no place in our public discourse, let alone in the people’s house.”
Bannon, and several others in Trump’s administration — including the president — have also been falsely labeled as antisemitic. Last December, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote, “Tell me how a man who publicly fights BDS, fights Iran, and opens a bureau in Jerusalem to support Israel is a Jew-hater? Tell me how a man who appoints some of the proudest Jews I know – like Joel Pollak – to the most senior positions at Breitbart is an enemy of our people?”

"Donald Trump claimed he has seen evidence the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, as he threatened tariffs on Beijing over its role in the global pandemic.",https://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-says-evidence-ties-china-lab-to-virus-threatens-tariffs-2/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,79.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Washington (AFP) – Donald Trump claimed he has seen evidence the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, as he threatened tariffs on Beijing over its role in the global pandemic.
The US president’s assertion was immediately undermined by his intelligence chief and by his top diplomat, who said: “We don’t know precisely where it began.”
Trump’s latest anti-China barb came as new figures showed 30 million Americans have lost their jobs during lockdown.
The gloom in the world’s largest economy found its parallel across the Atlantic, where experts warned of an unprecedented financial catastrophe in Europe.
More than 230,000 people are known to have died in a pandemic that has forced more than half of humanity to live under some kind of lockdown.
Scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market selling exotic animals for meat.
But speculation has swirled about a top-secret lab, reinforced by internet rumours and right-wing shock jocks — and increasingly taken up by the US president.
Asked if he had seen anything giving him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the outbreak, Trump replied, “Yes, I have.”
He refused to give details.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated he had not seen definitive evidence.
“We don’t know precisely where it began,” he said.
“We don’t know if it came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We don’t know if it emanated from the wet market or yet some other place. We don’t know those answers.”
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said analysts “will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine” the source of the outbreak.
Beijing has denied the lab was the source of the virus.
Last month foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: “(World Health Organization) officials have repeatedly stated that there is no single evidence that the new coronavirus was produced in a laboratory.”
“Many well-known medical experts in the world also believe that the so-called laboratory leak hypothesis has no scientific basis,”
Trump is making Beijing’s handling of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election campaign.
When asked about reports that he could cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could “do it differently” and act in “more of a forthright manner”.
“I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs,” he said.
Eurozone gloom
The latest jobless claims by another 3.84 million Americans mean roughly nine percent of the US population have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.
The economic costs of lockdowns imposed to try to limit the spread of the disease have spilled over into frustration.
In Michigan, protesters — some of them armed — stormed the state capitol building, demanding the removal of restrictions, which they say hurt the economy and represent governmental overreach.
The depressing US jobs data compounded a tough message from European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde.
“The euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime,” she warned.
ECB economists expect output in the 19-nation currency club to shrink by “five to 12 percent” this year, she added.
Lockdowns ease
The coronavirus has infected at least 3.2 million people so far, with Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin becoming the latest high-profile figure to test positive as his country’s caseload surged past 100,000.
But there was some reason for cheer.
Germany accelerated plans to start lifting its anti-virus lockdown, preparing gradually to ease curbs on public life and reopen religious institutions, museums and zoos — having restarted shopping last week.
“It remains absolutely important that we stay disciplined,” said Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Italy, once the world centre of the outbreak, said it was hoping to reopen two major airports next week, but would move slowly.
“We cannot allow the efforts made to be in vain because of rashness at this delicate stage,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.
And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who himself battled COVID-19, said his country — which has the world’s third-highest death toll, behind the US and Italy — was “past the peak” of its outbreak.
Johnson said he would publish a roadmap next week on easing restrictions.
All happening at the zoo
The stay-at-home rules have left zoo animals around the world short of visitors.
In Singapore, keepers have taken a colony of African penguins to the children’s playground to give the attention-starved birds a bit of stimulation.
And in Tokyo, aquarium bosses were asking members of the public to Facetime lonely eels, fearful that the shy creature are forgetting what humans look like.
“Garden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by,” said Sumida Aquarium. “Could you show your face to our garden eels from your home?”
For those who prefer their creatures virtual, Nintendo’s smash-hit “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” was offering lockdown solace.
“Right now, watching news on TV can really be scary, but in this game, it’s just as if nothing is happening, it’s all quiet and peaceful,” said Kanae Miya.","['threatened', 'claimed']"
"The hot new idea to tax America’s rich is a wealth tax, which – although designed to target the wealthiest taxpayers – could end up eventually hurting middle-class families.",https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/middle-class-americans-worry-wealth-tax,fox-news,middle-class,right,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The hot new idea to tax America’s rich is a wealth tax, which – although designed to target the wealthiest taxpayers – could end up eventually hurting middle-class families.
Continue Reading Below
As opposed to taxes levied on income and payrolls, a wealth tax would target the value of accumulated assets owned by rich Americans – or their net worth.
Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren have each put forward proposals for wealth taxes, which they say will only apply to people with $32 million or more ($16 million for individuals) and $50 million, respectively, a relatively small group of taxpayers.
But experts aren’t so sure that target ""small group"" of taxpayers will hold over time.
“That was what they said about the AMT [Alternative Minimum Tax],” Tim Speiss, co-leader of EisnerAmper's Personal Wealth Advisory Group, told FOX Business. “If you drop the [wealth tax threshold] down to a lower net worth base, forget it.”
The AMT, which was enacted in 1969, was initially designed to target about 155 wealthy taxpayers who were entirely avoiding income taxes by claiming special deductions. It acts as an extra tax on some, on top of their regular income tax.
However, since the measure was not indexed for inflation, the proportion of people who were required to pay ballooned over time.
According to a congressional report, about 1 million people paid the AMT in 1999, while about 31 million did so in 2010 – which covered all but the very lowest income classes.
“The government over time started to realize how much revenue they were getting,” Speiss said. “When you look at what happened here, it became much broader than where it began … instead of it being this add-on tax it really became broadened under the 1982 [tax] legislation and then that was really it.”
Tax revenue from the AMT was about $122 million in 1970. By 2014 it had grown to $28.6 billion.
If provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – which increased the AMT’s exemption and exemption phase out– aren’t extended, AMT revenue would leap from $6.2 billion in 2025 to $62.1 billion in 2026, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center.
Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute and editor of www.DownsizingGovernment.org, noted politicians would likely be faced with similar temptations after implementing a potential wealth tax.
“Once enacted, initial taxes just on the very rich wouldn’t raise much money, and the government would still have massive deficits with rising entitlement costs, so the liberal politicians would push to lower the wealth tax into the middle class,” Edwards told FOX Business.
Former Louisiana Governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal made a similar point during an interview with FOX Business this week, adding that average Americans have a right to be worried.
“The problem with these plans is … it always starts out that way, you know the income tax was only going to be on the wealthy – these taxes only are going to be on wealthy people – and then before you know it, if you own a nice home, if you own your car, if you have some savings for retirement, before you know it these wealth taxes are going to catch you as well,” Jindal told FOX Business’ Neil Cavuto.

Edwards also pointed out that wealth taxes enacted in countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have fairly low exemptions. In Switzerland, for example, the tax affected singles with net wealth slightly above 67,000 Euros (around $73,400) in 2017. When it still had the tax, Germany’s exemption threshold was around $66,800.
Perhaps that is why both Warren and Sanders have gone out of their way to hammer home the fact that their proposals would only affect the wealthiest Americans. Warren calls her plan the “ultra-millionaire tax,” while Sanders named his the “tax on extreme wealth.” They both are hoping the measure would help reduce growing economic inequality, as more resources become concentrated in the hands of a few rich individuals.
Critics, however, argue that there could be near-term repercussions for the economy. Rich Americans invest their wealth, creating jobs and income. That means a loss of innovation and opportunity if capital investment is discouraged. It also potentially means slower economic growth.

What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years.,https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/23/how-anti-white-rhetoric-is-fueling-white-nationalism/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea.
I opened Twitter recently and saw 20+ notifications. Most of the time that means the new generation of white nationalist Twitter trolls are filling my feed with racist and anti-Semitic cartoons. It was the trolls, but this was different. They were celebrating my use of the word “anti-white” in a tweet. They saw it as a victory that a “mainstream conservative” was using this term that for so long has been their calling card.
They had a point. Until recently I would have been unlikely to use the term. Not because I didn’t believe some people harbored animosity towards whites, but because that was a fringe attitude removed from power, which represented little real threat. That is no longer the case. Progressive rhetoric on race has turned an ugly corner and the existence of “anti-white” attitudes can no longer be ignored.
In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Loosely backed up by historical inequities and disparities in mass shootings, this position has begun to take a serious foothold.
Don’t Ask White People to Be More Tribal
Strikingly, this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.
Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race.
White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. The last thing our society needs is for white people to feel more tribal. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.
A big part of the reason white Americans have been willing to go along with policies that are prejudicial on their face, such as affirmative action, is that they do not view themselves as a tribe. Given the inequality of resources favoring whites in our society, it is a good thing that white people view themselves as the ones without an accent. Should that change, white privilege (whatever one views that to be) will not be eviscerated—it will be entrenched.
The Tipping Point of Whiteness
All of this comes at a time when the last immigrants from the great wave of white immigration from 1850-1920 have died off. In the past, most whites identified with their European ethnicity: Irish, Italian, German, etc. As white people gravitate away from such identities, many see themselves as a neutral, “non racial” population. The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as “white,” but it is far preferable to the alternative: an American white population that views itself as a special-interest group.
The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as ‘white,’ but it is far preferable to the alternative.
The recurring, tired refrain that we should have a white history month if there is a black history month, or white student unions on campuses, is unintentionally being given new life by the Left. Celebrations or organizations of whiteness do not exist because we don’t need them. White people do not face the same kinds of systemic discrimination that people of color do. But progressives are doing a very good job of convincing white people that they do.
When parents of Virginia high school students complained about a white privilege video being shown to their kids, they rightfully noted that their kids were being singled out based on their race. The video featured a foot race in which people of color were burdened by impediments while the white people ran free. It was absolutely fair for them to interpret this as a message to their kids saying, “Your accomplishments are easier and less valuable than those of your peers of color.”
Many parents object to this method of teaching about race relations. While some white people, especially those in the academy and the arts, find the acceptance of privilege and its associated guilt liberating, many do not. Privilege theory is also not being offered as one of many ways to confront and consider racism; it is being offered as the central way. This was brilliantly explored in 2010 by the Midwestern Critical Whiteness Collective’s (MCWC’s) article in Harvard Education Review, “McIntosh as Synecdoche: How Teacher Education Focus on White Privilege Undermines Anti Racism.”
Privilege Theory Is the Wrong Track
The McIntosh in question is Peggy McIntosh, whose 1988 essay “Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack” formed the foundation of privilege theory. The essay is mostly a list of ways in which white people receive better treatment in society. The MCWC describes McIntosh’s theory as a synecdoche because it has come to define the totality of education’s anti-racism efforts. It is meant to be the magic pill that clarifies things and sets us on the right course once consumed.
Many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.
They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. One case study involved an education student named John, from a small, non-diverse town. In his final essay for the class John explained his reaction to McIntosh: “I got the feeling from it that it was more about trying to make white males feel guilty for things they most likely had no control over. Being a white male I got a little worked up about the whole list since I don’t feel like I have anything to apologize for.”
John rolled his eyes at privilege theory. However, his teacher reported that other ways of exploring racism and multiculturalism such as films on race relations and historical texts broadened John’s empathy towards non-white people. John was able to reject confession while still becoming a better anti-racist educator. This made John’s teacher wonder whether confessional white privilege is the universally beneficial educational tool it is made out to be. The collective found that it is not.
In its blunt conclusion, the collective writes: “McIntosh’s conception of white privilege has been at the center of anti-racist thought and action in teacher education. We argue, however, that McIntosh’s ideas simplify white racial identity in dangerous ways. We also demonstrate that white privilege pedagogy demands confession, but that confession is a dead end. Finally, we propose that white supremacy needs to replace white privilege as the central concern of our anti-racist efforts.”
Abetting White Supremacy
When privilege theory took root in the 1990s, society roundly condemned the outward expression of racist attitudes. This is why the focus shifted to the ways in which white people were racist without even knowing it. Importantly, all white people were guilty of this form of racism. The act of confessing privilege became the means through which white people discovered this hidden racism.
The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
But, as the past year has shown us, good old-fashioned white supremacy was not gone; it was simply driven underground. Not only was white supremacy still extant, it was going more or less unaddressed. The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
One can teach against white supremacy by encouraging students to treat everyone as equal, or at least as individuals not defined in important ways by their race. Privilege theory does not allow for this approach. It demands that differences be front and center and that we always consider a person’s race in considering him. This focus on “valuing differences” over “the colorblind model” unlocked the door to the white supremacist revival that today’s anti-white rhetoric has kicked open.
White Grievance On the Rise
It surprises many people that an increasing number of white Americans over the past decade believe whites face more discrimination than blacks. Obviously this feeling is inconsistent with economic data. Many have argued that a white fear of losing the dominant economic place in society is behind this belief. But what if the discrimination that white people are feeling and expressing is not primarily economic in nature?
He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way.
This brings us back to John. What got him “worked up” about privilege theory was not that he’d have to compete for jobs with minorities. He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way. Moreover, many resent the pedagogical transformations that their history and culture are undergoing. White historical figures once held in too high esteem have swung the other way into utter disrepute. Also, the histories of no other peoples are being held to these lofty standards.
Mohandas Gandhi’s racism, the Black Panthers’ vicious murders, and Santa Anna’s barbarism are understood within the context of their positive contributions. Increasingly, white Americans perceive that Columbus, Jefferson, Jackson, and many other core white historical figures are consistently brought down a peg in order to decentralize whiteness in history. This assault on their history has a deeper impact than many on the Left are aware of, or willing to admit.
Rise of the White Race Baiters
The combination of the confessional and universal aspects of white privilege and the reconstruction of white history has opened the door for white racial grievance-mongers. From 2014 to 2015, the number of active Klu Klux Klan chapters in the United States grew from 72 to 190, a massive increase for a group so closely associated with hatred. Along with these organized efforts, social media has given a dangerous new platform to white supremacists.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers, specifically on college campuses. Conservative media seize upon disputes over the cultural appropriation of taco night or banning hoopskirts as evidence that minority racial grievance has gotten unhinged.
In emerging white nationalist journals such as Radix, this constant drumbeat of attack against white insensitivity is viewed gravely. What results is a belief among a growing number of whites in the concepts of “white genocide” and “racial realism.”
Both “white genocide” and “racial realism” harken back to the worst elements of American racial history. The former reacts in horror to the races mixing sexually for fear of resulting offspring being impure. The latter pretends to take a cold, scientific look at demography to prove the superiority of the white race. Ideas of this ilk, until recently thought to be confined to a fringe dustbin, have taken on new life in our hyper-racialized society.
Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. They are very aware of the dichotomy between non-white culture, which must be valued at all times (even in the midst of terror attacks), and white culture, which must be criticized and devalued. They don’t like it.
Same Tactics, Different Sides
The result of these societal double standards is for many a desire to lash out against it. For every white college student who dutifully accepts his privilege, many more resent the idea and wish to fight it. The sharpest arrow in their quiver is to be offensive.
In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
This desire to be offensive has given rise to the “alt right.” Supporters of this loosely assembled white nationalist movement understand a playful aspect to its use of slurs. But just as the Left shifted from using anti-white rhetoric as an ironic device to an actual indictment of white culture, so has the alt right come to believe much of its troubling rhetoric.
Do the alt right Twitter trolls really want Jews turned into lampshades, or believe blacks are apes? Many of their supporters say no, that such rhetoric is simply meant to shock the system. They feel oppressed by political correctness and they challenge it, in over-the-top, offensive ways.
If this seems familiar, it should. It is exactly the same approach taken by social justice warriors and purveyors of anti-white rhetoric. The shocking “White Men Are Bad” hot takes serve the same purpose. They are also meant to shock the system. Just as the alt right is willing to denigrate minorities to make plain what they view as racist speech codes, the Left is willing to denigrate straight, white men to make plain what they view as widespread systemic racism.
For both groups the central theme is identity. That theme quickly calcifies into attitudes too brittle to hold up serious discourse. In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
Let’s Find Another Way Forward
W.E.B. Du Bois was born just three years after the end of slavery, but was bullish on the prospects of equality, he writes in “The Souls of Black Folks.”
Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic…
Modern progressives don’t talk about the “greater ideals of the American Republic.” Rather, those ideals have become suspect, empty words used to justify slavery and genocide. But for Du Bois, who was closer to slavery than any of us will ever be, this was not the case. The facile notion that some inherent evil of whiteness must be expunged is anathema to his entire vision of equality and reconciliation.
Put simply, our anti-racism efforts must be refocused away from guilt and confession and towards equality and eradicating irrational judgments based on race. Some on the Left will object, saying that racism is so systemic in society it must be purged before anyone can pretend to treat of others without taking race into account. Some on the Right will object, saying that everything from IQ tests to crime statistics prove something meaningful about the capabilities of individuals based on their race.
Both of these perspectives must be rejected. In their place, we must return to the goal of treating people as individuals, not as representatives of their race.","['strange', 'rhetorical']"

Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/05/end-trump-presidency-not-a-chance/,federalist,trump-presidency,right,79.0,4.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Never Trumpers are rejoicing that fresh on the heels of COVID, the current riots and unrest will spell the end of the Trump administration. Are they right?
Earlier this week in the Washington Post, George Will declared that the current riots, COVID, and the collective economic fallout are the death knell of the Trump presidency. Will admits Trump is not the genesis of any of the aforementioned crises but blames him for making them worse. Will believes this can, and should, lead to Trump’s downfall.
Until a few months ago, the booming economy made Trump an all-but-unbeatable incumbent. But with the ongoing pandemic and the unrest of recent days, the nation may be swayed by low morale, economic devastation, and loss of confidence in the commander in chief.
Then again, the media continues its deceptive coverage of the riots and accuses all white people of racism—as though Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd’s murders are not repulsive to all Americans. These are the same failed leftist tactics that helped get Trump elected in 2016. If they keep it up, Trump’s defeat may become wishful thinking on the part of those who have never understood Trump’s people or his appeal.
The Left Still Doesn’t Get Trump or the American People
Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them?
Admittedly, Donald Trump is not who I would have chosen for our nation’s highest office. But the fact remains our fellow Americans elected him. He reflects our current political experience. We cannot dismiss Trump and what he stands for without also dismissing the views of the millions of men and women who choose him to be president. Who in their right mind watches these riots and begs for a Biden presidency?
Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Even if Trump loses in November, millions will still want the kind of policies and leadership that Donald Trump gave them. To ignore them is to invite further division and civil unrest.
No One Makes Americans Feel More Understood than Trump
Will’s rant calls to mind a trip I took to NYC with a friend a few months ago. On our drive home, the car stalled. We ended up taking an hour and a half ride in a tow truck to drag the car from Staten Island to Trenton, NJ.
As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. I can only imagine what he thinks of these protests rage through Manhattan and into his neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Here’s why the Never Trumpers can’t succeed: there’s nothing George Will, Joe Biden, or anyone else can say to this tow truck driver to make him feel more understood, validated, and empowered than Donald Trump does. Frankly, they don’t want this man’s support—but Donald Trump does.
After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government.
Can Anything Stop Donald Trump?
There’s another reality the Never Trumpers and the left can’t see: if you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he’s delivered on almost every promise he’s made to you. No, there is no border wall that Mexico has paid for. Still, this is largely the fault of Congress and the judiciary. On issues like deregulation, economic growth, and the federal courts, Trump has exceeded the expectations of his voters.
Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. So long as the left keeps violating Americans’ sense of justice, voters will stick with the guy they trust to restore it.
They’re Not After Trump, They’re After You
Trump himself put it best in a tweet posted last year.
“In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way.”
This is what causes the loyalty that Trump supporters have for their Commander-in-Chief. They recognize that the left’s attacks on Trump are actually attacks on them. Just like the left has attacked Trump for his SCOTUS picks, or pro-life stance, now they’re attacking him for “stoking racial tensions” and accuse him of using “aggressive tactics” to restore law and order.
Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.
After this national tragedy quiets down, there will be no shortage of voices telling the American people that they should be ashamed of themselves. I assure you, Joe Biden will be chief among them. Donald Trump will lose no support if he can keep doing what he’s always done for his loyal followers: make them feel proud to be American.","['zeal', 'missionary']"

“Whether we like it or not, this COVID pandemic has basically shut down the country the last three months and by the way, if we shut it down a month earlier, we’d have probably another forty-five to sixty-thousand people who’d be alive,” said the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, going on to pin the deaths on President Donald Trump. “I’m going to say something outrageous: he didn’t listen to guys like me back in January saying ‘we have a problem.'”
This is a gigantic lie told by Joe Biden. He DID NOT call for a nationwide lockdown in January in response to the coronavirus.

Biden however, said no such thing in January. To the contrary, Biden actually criticized the travel ban implemented against China early on to slow the virus arrival to U.S. shores as “xenophobic.”
“This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia,” Biden said at an Iowa campaign stop leading up to the first-in-the-nation contest.

Free trade has helped gut working and middle class American jobs and stripped whole middle American towns of their industries and livelihoods.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/01/josh-hawley-bushs-globalist-new-world-order-has-made-the-elites-rich-eroded-middle-class-way-of-life/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,79.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"President George H.W. Bush’s plan for a “New World Order” with global integration of the United States’ economy has made the ruling class richer while eroding “the middle class way of life” in America, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) says.
In an interview on The Realignment podcast, Hawley described how the long-held push by both political establishments to massively globalize the American economy has been at the expense of U.S. workers while the ruling class and their allies in the donor class have profited.
Hawley said:
If I have to give you a sense of the kind of vision that I think voters rejected, President Bush … gave a speech to Congress in 1990 where he talked about a ‘New World Order,’ and he was saying this of the situation in the context with Iraq, but he talked broadly about a ‘New global liberal order’ that of course America would lead, that it would involve America making the world much more like America and the rest of the world kind of blending in with America … and there wouldn’t be the need for hard borders any longer, and we’d have free trade, and we’d have great multinational cooperation, and we’d have these multinational corporations that can do business in any country, and it would be a whole new era. [Emphasis added] … Well, as it turns out — first of all, China and Russia didn’t get the memo on that — secondly, as it turns out, that ‘New World Order’ wasn’t good for American workers. And as it turned out, it didn’t protect American middle class values. As it turned out, it undermined the middle class way of life. [Emphasis added]
Hawley said the ruling class is primarily a “small group of people” from a “fairly narrow band of colleges and graduate schools” who largely agree on the most challenging issues facing the nation and oppose the traditionalism of middle American communities.
“They also tend to be the winners of this global integration. George Bush’s ‘New World Order,’ the people who have been in charge of the parties who run the media, who hold commanding heights in our culture; they win from that agreement,” Hawley said of the ruling class. “They’re doing great; they are the wealthy in our society. They are the ones who are globally integrated and global facing.”
Hawley continued:
They also tend to be skeptical of places like Missouri and of things like home and community. So they say that they value those things, but you listen to somebody … and somebody says, “I’m not going to move from this small town even though I’m having trouble finding a job because my family is here and because this is where we’ve lived for generations and this is where my friends are and I want to make a life here.” A lot of D.C. elites in both parties listen to that and they’re like, “That’s crazy.”
As Breitbart News has chronicled, free trade has helped gut working and middle class American jobs and stripped whole middle American towns of their industries and livelihoods.
Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed and China was allowed to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), five million American manufacturing jobs and more than 50,000 manufacturing facilities have been eliminated from the U.S. economy. This mass elimination of jobs due to free trade has coincided with an almost 600 percent increase in trade deficits.
In recent years, the economic recovery from the Great Recession disproportionately benefitted elite zip codes. For example, by 2016, elite zip codes had a surplus of 3.6 million jobs, which is more than the combined bottom 80 percent of American zip codes. While populations have grown in major cities where the wealthiest of Americans live, rural communities have continued to shrink.

“I can’t even believe they have the nerve to spit in the face of Americans who are now unemployed,” said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at the NumbersUSA. The GOP and President Donald Trump must oppose the “Foreign Workers First bill,” she said. “Americans are being laid off right and left … Americans are going to need all the help they can get.”
“Congress seems hell-bent on replacing Americans with foreigners,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “We’re going to have 30 percent unemployment or more — higher than the Great Depression — and yet we are going to bring in more people from abroad? It surreal.”
“This House bill is disgusting,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition, which organizes U.S. graduates to oppose companies’ growing use of foreign visa workers. “It is an overreach; it has to be called out.”
“During the public health emergency …. [officials] shall temporarily suspend or modify any procedural requirement with which an applicant, petitioner, or other person or entity must otherwise comply under the immigration law,” says Sec. 10607 on page 63 of the 1,119-page House draft.
The suspensions are intended to “ensure the timely and fair adjudication of applications or petitions … [to] prevent hardship to applicants, petitions, beneficiaries, or other persons or entities, including by granting automatic or other extensions or renewals when necessary to protect individuals from lapses in status or work authorizations.”
At a time when millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Pelosi’s bill includes a measure to automatically extend nonimmigrant work visas. https://t.co/t1n9nWFC0W pic.twitter.com/MvXTKrBnIn — Ben Goldey (@BenGoldey) March 23, 2020
The bill would even allow H-1B visa workers to stay long past the six-term limit on their temporary stays. For example, the foreign workers who are expected to go home in the next 12 months will instead be allowed to “automatically extend such status or work authorization for the same time period as the alien’s prior status or work authorization.” For H-1Bs, the “same time period’ is three years.
The bill would keep several hundred thousand white-collar visa workers and several hundred thousand blue-collar work-permit workers in the U.S. labor market, even as unemployment is expected to spike past 20 percent.
The bill would also provide a massive giveaway to the many technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies that have replaced a huge number of U.S. graduates with large blocs of compliant Indian and Chinese graduates.
Without the House language, these wealthy companies would be forced to hire hundreds of thousands of American graduates if their lobbyists cannot persuade the administration to renew the foreign workers’ expiring permits during the massive surge of unemployment among white-collar Americans before the 2020 election.
The visa extensions are backed by FWD.us, a lobby group for West Coast Investors.
The legislation also matches the goals of Compete America. The lobby group has been pushing Congress to pass the S.386 green card giveaway to roughly 300,0000 Indian Hi-1B workers who are employed in the United States by technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies.
In mid-March, the Department of Homeland Security said it had not stopped plans to deliver 85,000 college-graduate H-1B visa workers to U.S companies.
“You could make an argument for extending current visas, just to prevent disruption,” said Krikorian. “Paired with that would have to be a freeze on future visas [because] you can’t have it both ways – then everyone gets to stay, and more new people would be allowed in,” he said.
‘If your time is up, you should need to go home,” Krikorian added.
“I would hope that the administration would oppose it,” said Jenks, adding:
American workers are going to need all the help they can get. We need to focus on putting Americans back to work … Hopefully, we will start getting the economy rolling again in less than 43 months, and those jobs are going to be needed by Americans who are being laid off.
“I’m not sure this would be [bad] enough for Trump to veto this bill,” said Kirkorian, adding:
There is so much else going on and in such a panic. I expect that the tech lobbyists’ are counting on Trump being very reluctant to veto this bill. Really, the responsibility is on Republican legislatures to make sure he is not presented with that choice. The problem is that the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats when it comes to preferring visa workers over Americans, but there are some honorable exceptions.
Democrats are trying to make Trump eat a “cap sandwich,” Krikorian said. The Republicans’ job “is to make sure the President is not presented with distasteful actions like this.”
Bad news, House bill would give #H1Bs who had been laid off before corona virus, and those ""on the bench"", a whole new 3-year lease in America's labor pool.

American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.
In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.
Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.","['massive', 'giveaway', 'Indian', 'compliant']"

This prohibition is but the first portion of the implementation of I-1639, the gun control initiative pushed by millionaires and billionaires and passed by voters on November 6, 2018.
The language of the initiative gives the impression that it only covers firearms which the left describes as “semiautomatic assault rifles,” but in reality the initiative includes all operable semiautomatic rifles as “assault rifles,” except for antiques.
On September 25, 2018, Breitbart News reported that the language of I-1639 clearly defines “semiautomatic assault rifles” as “any rifle which utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round, and which requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge.” In other words, I-1639 bars 18-20-year-olds from purchasing semiautomatic rifles in general.
The Associated Press reports that the prohibition against 18-20-year-olds went into effect January 1, 2019, The remainder of the gun controls in I-1639 include gun storage laws, enhanced background checks, and fees to cover the cost of the new checks, among other things. The remaining gun controls take effect on July 1.
Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility’s Kristen Ellingboe supported the prohibition curtailing 18-20-year-olds’ exercise of Second Amendment rights. She said, “We’ve seen that assault rifles are the weapon of choice for mass shootings, and when they’re used, more people are killed and injured.” But a look at mass shootings during the time frame of 1966-2016 shows that mass shooters’ weapon of choice is a handgun.
On May 30, 2018, Breitbart News reported a Rockefeller Institute of Government study showing that mass shooters during that 50 year period chose handguns over rifles of any kind by nearly a 3 to 1 margin.

Now it's 'economic nationalism.' Stop telling us how to be patriotic.
Politicians have no business directing or defining patriotism — especially when their rhetoric sounds like 1950s-era Soviet sloganeering.
It was creepy when Barack Obama declared his first inauguration day a “National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation” and “called” on us to find “common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century.” And it’s creepy when Donald Trump declares his inauguration day a “National Day of Patriotic Devotion;” one in which “a new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart.”
You can find both, unfortunately, in the Federal Register.
This kind of self-aggrandizement is what you see under cults of personality, not American republicanism. Far be it from me to lecture anyone on how to love his country, but if your devotion to America is contingent on the party in office, you’re probably not doing it like the Founders envisioned. It’s bad enough that these inaugurations are treated as coronations. It can’t be patriotic to treat politicians like quasi-religious figures. Moreover, it ties patriotism — either implicitly, or in some cases rather explicitly — to a preferred set of policy initiatives or a political office.
We just survived eight years of a messianic presidency, with a finger-wagging, patriotism-appropriating administration lecturing us on how to be proper Americans. If you didn’t support the administration’s point of view, Joe Biden might accuse you of “betting against America.”
“What we need as a nation,” then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, echoing the president, wrote to a Republican Congress in 2014, “is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise or fall together.” Was Lew talking about our unalienable right to free expression? No, he was talking about punishing America-based companies that were trying to lower their tax burden, which happens to be one of the highest rates in the free world.
If we’re going to play this game, by the way, avoiding excessive taxation is also one of the most American things we can do.
So it was creepy when Obama was trying to replace American idealism with progressivism and calling it “economic patriotism,” and it’s creepy when Trump does basically the same thing under the guise of economic nationalism.
Now, judging from the campaign rhetoric, failing to support tariffs or other counterproductive “buy American” economic policies will have you branded seditious over the next four years. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who probably had something to do with the devotion order, has referred to himself as “economic nationalist,” a loaded term that means you only love your country if you support mercantilism. Economic nationalists rely on a populism that lays blame on others — Mexico, China, whoever — for American problems. It’s a philosophy, if we listen to Bannon or Trump, that values power over most principles, including liberty. So it sounds like many things, none of them American patriotism.
The idea is amorphous, but patriotism, especially in this country, is driven by idealism rather than chauvinism, ethnicity, or “power.” As George Orwell famously noted, nationalism isn’t the same as patriotism. In the American sense, patriotism is a fidelity to a place and the Constitution, and is by its nature “defensive, both militarily and culturally.” Nationalism, on the other hand, “is inseparable from the desire for power.” A devotional to our “new national pride” strongly hints at the latter.
You can hate your president and love your country. You can hope your president fails and still be patriotic. We don’t always have a “shared purpose.” That’s because presidents are not only commanders in chief, they are politicians with agendas. And sometimes those agendas clash with your worldview. Let’s not have devotionals venerating of their ascendency every four years.",[]
"Reducing the upper tax rate can often, counterintuitively, increase total government tax revenue — because the rich, instead of engaging in complicated (but legal) tax avoidance schemes, are happy to pay what they consider a fair rate.",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/01/23/simon-pegg-tax-the-rich-to-save-the-world/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,80.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Mission Impossible star Simon Pegg has signed an open letter demanding that multi-millionaires like himself should pay more tax.
The open letter — Millionaires Against Pitchforks — has been released to coincide with the orgy of virtue-signalling by the globalist elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
According to the letter both the climate and democracy are at stake:
It is time for us to act. Despite vocal protests to the contrary, most reasonable people understand that philanthropy has always been, and always will be, an inadequate substitute for government investment. Taxes are the best and only appropriate way to ensure adequate investment in the things our societies need. Individuals who reject this truth pose a dual threat both to the climate and to democracy itself, as those seeking to avoid their tax responsibilities are often the same ones manipulating governments and democratic processes around the world for their own gain.
Explaining his decision to sign, Simon Pegg writes in the Times (of London):
“Inequality is not inevitable, it’s a policy choice. It’s the product of governments passing policies that favour the very wealthy at the expense of the less fortunate. New estimates show that almost half of the world’s population is trying to survive on $5.50 a day or less, and that the rate of poverty reduction has halved since 2013. In the last decade the number of billionaires has doubled.”
Pegg’s article is certainly an invaluable reminder of why thespians are much better at speaking lines written for them by clever people than they are at pronouncing intelligently on global fiscal policy.
Few would deny that Pegg — who made a name for himself in the charming 90s series Spaced, before launching his film career with cult classic movies such as Shaun of the Dead — is a fine and amusing comedy actor. Nobody begrudges the way he lucked out so massively by landing the role of Tom Cruise’s geeky tech whizz in the Mission Impossible movies and broke into the Hollywood big time.
What people might well wonder, though, is what on earth he thinks he’s doing putting his name to such economically illiterate tosh as this fatuous, bleeding heart screed of borderline communist drivel.
Pegg concludes:
“Our fractured world is repairable, we can build a more equal society where the richest contribute their fair share. Our politicians must govern in the interests of all, not just those with the deepest pockets.”
But the richest do already contribute their fair share, as UK political interviewer Andrew Neil bluntly pointed to Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry only this week on his BBC TV show.
Like many on the left, Thornberry — aka Baroness Nugee — sees taxing the rich as the solution to everything and attempted to claim that the “well-off” are paying less tax now than 10 years ago.
In the UK, though, this is objectively untrue.
As Neil pointed out, in the last year of the Labour government, in 2010, the richest 5 percent of taxpayers provided 45 percent of total government revenue. Now the richest 5 percent of taxpayers provide 50 percent of total government revenue in the UK.
This is a simple function of the Laffer Curve — a phenomenon clearly unknown to actors like Simon Pegg, which is surprising because it does get a mention in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.
Reducing the upper tax rate can often, counterintuitively, increase total government tax revenue — because the rich, instead of engaging in complicated (but legal) tax avoidance schemes, are happy to pay what they consider a fair rate.
If Pegg and his fellow signatories — including the inevitable Richard Curtis, director of some of the world’s most nauseating rom-coms — got their way, then, far from easing the burden of the poor it would make their lives harder. The wealthy are quite reasonably reluctant to give away more of their money than they have to and would simply move to more tax friendly jurisdictions, thus meaning the governments in high tax jurisdictions would have less to spend on worthy projects.",[]
"Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman.

This is not meant as a trick question, but it might be a little tricky. Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white.
There’s a complication, though. If whites can’t take pride in our ethnicity, is it okay for blacks or Hispanics to have ethnic pride? Our society looks on that kind of boosterism with a much more tolerant eye. What’s the difference? Have we so succumbed to the siren song of privilege theory that white people are the only ones left who are not allowed to feel good about ourselves?
That Damned ‘Invisible Backpack’
As David Marcus explained in this insightful essay, privilege theory is indeed a real problem. It helped re-awaken tribal loyalties that would have been better left shifting in their shallow graves. Everyone is better off when whites don’t think too much about their whiteness. It should be normal without being normative, and regular without being right. It’s having a one-story house. It’s writing in black pen. It’s Times New Roman.
Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman. They poked and they prodded, and eventually got the resentful backlash they were provoking. Privilege theory has done real damage, and white liberals should be assessing their mistakes. Nevertheless, it’s hard to believe that privilege theory is the only culprit.
When higher allegiances break down, lower ones become more prominent. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, and that involves finding reasons to align yourself with this group of people, instead of that other one. Group allegiances are not necessarily an excuse for hatred or bigotry (although they can give rise to those evils). They’re about belonging somewhere, and having people you can turn to when the road gets rocky. People need that.
It’s no secret that Trumpism and the alt-right have found their strongest footholds in places where social and economic breakdown are the worst. Family structures break down, church communities dwindle, the economy sags, and ethno-nationalism becomes more appealing.
Proud to Be a (White) American?
Is Trumpism racist? It’s been a contentious question of late. While it’s perfectly evident that Trump does have racist supporters (which he is suspiciously reluctant to condemn), many contend that Trumpism is itself not racist, but merely a justified reaction to the Left’s racial patronage. All Trump’s supporters really want is a properly colorblind society.
It’s not a terribly convincing argument because, among other reasons, Trumpism so obviously represents a desperate cry for group recognition and a demand for group patronage. How has the market been good for us? Bring back our jobs. Even the “America first” motto is clearly focused on a particular vision of America that only a minority of its citizens seem to share.
We may be reaching the point where we need to define more carefully what “racism” really means. To that end, the rhetoric of the alt-right may perhaps be worth examining as an indicator of what some of our “white boosters” are thinking nowadays. There’s admittedly some distance between ordinary Trump supporters and alt-right quasi-intellectuals, but the latter have clearly attracted a non-trivial following in the Trump camp. Alt-rightism shouldn’t be lazily dismissed as a totally detached, insane fringe. It has hit a chord with many ordinary Americans, thriving on the mainstream’s predictable preference for shunning its arguments instead of answering them.
Many alt-right thinkers are willing to argue openly that race matters, that genetics play a non-trivial role in the progression of cultures, and that race is naturally a deep component of personal identity. These arguments can get a lot of oxygen in a world already obsessed with race. Liberals have had their identity politics parties and now alt-righters want theirs, which they expect will be truly amazing because they are in possession of western culture, the best cultural heritage there is.
Conquering Western Civilization
Hear them roar! Alt-righters love to talk about how smart and strong and savvy they are. (Fun game: count the number of times this article brags about those smarty-pants alt-righters and their incredible intellectual heft.) They usually get away with it because they surround themselves with amateurs, who are unprepared for their juvenile jibes. After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler.
Try again, Hayes. Don’t validate the white supremacist’s claim to own Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Boetheus, Bonaventure, Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Milton, Da Vinci, Tolstoy, Columbus, Newton, our Founding Fathers and alright, yes, possibly Hitler. Instead, ask him to justify his emphasis on whiteness as a cornerstone of western thought.
Undoubtedly, white men feature prominently among the heroes and visionaries of the West, and it’s reasonable to conclude on those grounds that white men can’t just be natural degenerates, as some liberals seem to suppose. Still, the greatness of the Western tradition doesn’t lie in its whiteness and maleness. It lies in its breadth, adaptability, and universality.
Terence, great playwright of the Roman Republic, told us “I am a man; nothing human is alien from me.” St. Paul told us that in Christ, “There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female.” The great thinkers of the high Middle Ages were intensely focused on the human condition, not the Italian or French or male condition. No student of the Western canon ever pauses in the middle of “City of God” to ask, “Wasn’t St. Monica born in Northern Africa? Why are we reading this Augustine clown?”
In short, the Western ethos at its best is profoundly un-tribal. To claim this rich tradition specifically for whites, therefore, is to muddy it and betray its core tenets. American whites can absolutely take pride in their Western heritage. They came from the old world and settled this immense, wild place, extending the great traditions of their forefathers to a whole new land. But if we’re going to take pride in our Western heritage, we should understand that legacy calls for transcending xenophobic ethno-nationalism. We shouldn’t need that, and we have something much better.
The downside of the glorious Western tradition, though, is that its perversion can be ugly, raising dreams of totalitarian domination. (Now a Hitler reference would be acceptable.) Especially here in America, a young nation founded by old-world immigrants with classically liberal commitments, there just isn’t a healthy or grounded way to take pride in whiteness per se.
Slouching Towards Bethlehem
Let’s return to the title question. Why is white pride creepy when black pride isn’t? Shouldn’t we have to choose between a universal ethic of colorblindness, and one that endorses ethnic tribalism at least to some degree?
It turns out that white pride really is categorically different. To understand why, though, we have to think carefully about traditions and their role in lives and cultures. Melanin levels are not in themselves a significant indicator of human character or worth, and whites are not morally inferior (or superior) to any other ethnic group. Nevertheless, cultures do matter, and it could be that “white culture” just isn’t a healthy or organic phenomenon in the way that black culture is or at least can be.
Ethnic pride really isn’t a necessary feature of a healthy psychology, but it can be acceptable when attached to a meaningful tradition that also imposes expectations and requirements. Most of us have probably known kids from Asian backgrounds whose elders are constantly reminding them that their behavior and work ethic will reflect back on their family and clan. That ethos definitely seems to contain an element of ethnic pride. However, it’s incorporated into a tradition and community ethos in such a way as to be a mostly positive influence.
Black pride is connected to a minority subculture that developed in response to intense historical oppression. For most of American history, the non-integration of blacks into mainstream culture was imposed from the outside, so taking offense over the existence of a distinct black subculture would hardly be reasonable. (Of course it doesn’t follow that this culture should be impervious to critique.) It’s an authentic tradition that incorporated an ethnic element for extremely understandable historical reasons. Something similar could be said of most Native American traditions.
Blacks and Native Americans, as the most obviously oppressed ethnic groups in our nation’s history, have also been the most averse to mainstream integration. Other ethnic groups tend to be absorbed more organically into mainstream American culture with the second, third, and fourth generations. They may retain a certain cultural distinctiveness in their names, diets, or cultural festivals, but insofar as they do stand apart, these groups generally adhere to traditions that are substantive enough to keep megalomaniacal urges in check. Ethnic pride isn’t just an entitlement; it’s also an expectation.
Will the Real Cuckservatives Please Stand Up?
White pride really doesn’t have an honorable tradition to call its own. Its claims on Western culture are tenuous, and none of the other reference points (segregation and skinheads) are particularly admirable. So it really does seem reasonable to say that whiteness, although in no way shameful, is not per se a healthy source of pride.
Viewing the matter in this light, it’s somewhat unsurprising that our alt-right partisans actually seem to pride themselves on being brainy rebels and devil-may-care pranksters. They’re not traditionalists in any normal sense, because they stand outside the circle of ordinary civil discourse, and even take joy in the fact. They’re what happens when traditionalism meets expressive individualism, in a world with too many resentful loners and not enough churches. They brilliantly combine the worst of cosmopolitanism (its rootlessness) with the worst of provincialism (its narrow-minded tribalism).
Just as much as the progressives they loathe, alt-righters are the bad fruit of a collapsing culture, taking pride in whiteness because they’re too alienated from more-substantive cultural institutions (family, church, community) to find a more fitting link to their Western forbears. Will the real cuckservatives please stand up? I don’t think it’s the Paul Ryans of the world who are disgracing the legacy of the West.
As every literate conservative has now realized, the collapse of Middle America is one of the great challenges that faces our society in the present moment. We need to rebuild our families and our cultural institutions so people of all backgrounds can find meaningful community and personal identity. White pride is a bad starting point, however. Let’s not sell our Western heritage for a mess of identity-politics pottage.","['resentful', 'backlash']"
"While Pace receives her spiritual grace from a Christian God, science has shown that faith in a supernatural wonder, whatever it may be, that bears powerful benefits on an individual’s mental and even physical well-being.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/29/coronavirus-got-you-down-have-faith/,federalist,coronavirus,right,81.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While 1 in 3 Americans show signs of clinical anxiety and depression, faith can be the vaccine to the nation's insanity.
When Jenita Pace was 21-years-old, she tried to kill herself with a bottle of pills after her husband left for work. As fate would have it, Pace’s husband had forgotten something at home that day and came back to find her prepping for the act she had been contemplating for seven months.
Pace was immediately admitted to a small psychiatric hospital in South Carolina where she stayed for ten days. It was there that Pace developed a deep faith which ultimately saved her life and has sustained her spiritual health ever since, including when the darkness of depression crept back just two years later almost forcing her into remission.
Within 24 hours of her arrival, Pace experienced a divine moment flipping through the pages of her Bible, the only personal item she was permitted to keep after begging the staff not to take it upon entry.
“That first night was really rough,” Pace told The Federalist, noting that sleep was a luxury hard to come by under her new circumstances.
While sitting on the bed of an intimidating and unfamiliar place where she was admitted against her will, Pace stumbled upon Psalm 121, reading:
I lift my eyes up to the hills, where does my help come from? My help comes from the maker of Heaven and Earth. He who takes care of you will not slumber and sleep. The lord will watch over you. The Lord is your shade at your right hand. The sun will not harm you by day or the moon by night. The Lord will keep you from harm, and He will watch over you. He will watch over you now and forever.
The passage quickly became a holy lifeline Pace held onto throughout her time in the psyche ward and thereafter.
“God really gave it to me very quickly,” Pace said. “I used it every night after that. Used it all day and before sleep, especially.”
Nineteen years later, Pace is now a licensed counselor in Minnesota who has helped hundreds others overcome their own mental struggles.
Pace’s story is intimately familiar to millions of others who rely on religious faith to cope with the disease of anxiety and depression among other traumas. While Pace receives her spiritual grace from a Christian God, science has shown that faith in a supernatural wonder, whatever it may be, that bears powerful benefits on an individual’s mental and even physical well-being.
In a systematic review of the academic literature up to 2010 surrounding spirituality and depression, Duke University psychiatrist Harold Koenig found that nearly two-thirds of studies showed a significant association between religious involvement and less depression. About half found a significant reduction in anxiety.
Several studies since then have continued to offer compelling testimony to the psychic power of religion as the nation faces the greatest mental health crisis in recent history rising concurrent with the coronavirus pandemic. Census data released last week show 1 in 3 Americans now exhibiting symptoms of clinical anxiety or depression. As the literature shows however, faith is the vaccine to insanity.
A 2014 study by Columbia University psychologist Lisa Miller found that spirituality and religion can act as a psychic armor to protect individuals from depression by thickening the brain cortex. In 2011, Miller had also found that among adults who reported a high importance on religion or spirituality, 76 percent were less likely to suffer from a major depressive episode, even when their parents had depression therefore raising their risk.
“Faith is hope that there’s a future,” East Tennessee therapist Allysen Efferson told The Federalist, highlighting the importance of holding onto eccelesiastical beliefs amid a global deficit of forward optimism.
In an increasingly anxious era, Dr. Koenig explained that those who hold such faith are likely to experience less anxiety under the current pandemic than secularized persons.
“People with religious faiths are not grappling with this by themselves,” Koenig told The Federalist. “People who have faith are going to experience less anxiety because they’re not carrying that entire burden of stress on their own. They have help.”
Koenig added that while studies have shown religious involvement associated with better mental health, this involvement is also associated with better physical health correlating with stronger immune systems and faster recovery from infection making faith all the more important to a virus-stricken world.
Koenig even found that religion can stave off aging. With a team of researchers from China and Saudi Arabia, Koenig studied the telomere lengths of Chinese Muslims which are key indicators of age and well-being.
“Telomeres serve as a biological clock within the cell that determines how long the cell will survive,” Koenig said. “When the telomeres shorten to a critical length, the cells cannot reproduce and leads to death of the organ and eventually the person.”
In their study, Koenig and his colleagues found a significantly positive relationship between spirituality and the subjects’ telomere lengths.
“It makes perfect sense from a science standpoint, because psychological distress causes an increase in inflammation in the body and it is that inflammation that shortens telomeres,” Koenig said. “Because religion helps people to cope better with stress, this helps to reduce the level of chronic low-grade inflammation, thereby reducing the speed of telomere shortening and extending longevity.”
More practically, religious values often discourage the addictive vices that Americans have clung to in order to cope with never ending lockdowns by promoting healthy lifestyles. Alcohol sales have spiked while Americans excessively over eat, smoke and drink their way through the pandemic.
There are online groups for substance abuse recovery. Find resources here, here and here.
“Religion helps to counteract those behaviors by encouraging people to not smoke, not drink, not use drugs, support family members, and stay physically active as a way of preserving the temple of the Holy Spirit,” said Koenig, at least in the Christian tradition.
While the benefits of faith on an individual’s well-being is clear, Pace still urges anyone struggling to seek professional help.
“First, there is no shame in needing help,” Pace said. “I wish that somebody had led me to that before I tried to kill myself.”
Pace cautioned however, not to expect a quick fix and to focus on building a community of support, a community often found in religious institutions made available online in the absence of open houses of worship.
“Churches are working hard to implement resources, many of them offer a list of faith based counselors and some even have in-house counselors, videos and resources,” Pace said. “I encourage clients to reach out to a church, even if they are not a member, because faith communities are typically open to helping anyone in need.”
Some counselors however, aren’t always good listeners Pace said, as she encountered the experience first-hand while in the South Carolina psychiatric hospital. One group therapist was encouraging participants to “be the captain of your own ship,” but those present weren’t buying it.
“As the captain of the ship I wanted to sink the ship” one group participant said, which “ticked off” the therapist.
If some counselors aren’t good listeners Pace said, then move on to another.

"The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait like an article arguing white supremacists have an Asian woman fetish.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/01/12/new-york-times-needs-get-white-supremacy-fetish/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,81.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait like an article arguing white supremacists have an Asian woman fetish.
We used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times, we know it’s just another sinister tool of white supremacy.
Over the past few years, it seems like every week our media-academia complex discovers a new addition to the list of “things that seem completely innocuous but are actually white supremacist.” In recent months, for example, we’ve learned that math, logic, and even square dancing are “weapon[s] of white supremacy.” (You should feel a pang of guilt for every time you do-si-doed in elementary school.)
Here’s their latest hot take: in a recent essay for the New York Times Sunday Review, journalist Audrea Lim argues that “the white supremacists on the far right have ‘yellow fever’ — an Asian woman fetish.” Her evidence boils down to a few anecdotes about the worst-of-the-worst of white nationalism: perennial idiot Richard Spencer thinks Asian girls are “cute” and “smart,” Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin went to a shopping mall with his Filipina girlfriend, and Asian-American porn star Tila Tequila once did a Nazi salute.
To bolster her argument with historical context, Lim even includes a direct quote from Adolf Hitler expressing his admiration for the civilizations of China and Japan. Pro tip: when you’re quoting Hitler, you’re losing the argument.
How About Providing Some Evidence For Those Claims
Certainly, there is a stock character in American life of the lonely, socially awkward, middle-aged white man who wants a “submissive Asian wife.” A feature-length PBS documentary even follows one of these sad sacks in his quest to find a mail-order bride from China. It’s pathetic and trades in racial stereotypes, but that hardly makes it “white supremacist.” In fact, Lim provides no evidence that this phenomenon is even unique to white men, which begs the question: is it really true that white men have an “Asian fetish”?
Lim doesn’t say, but thankfully, we can find detailed statistical information through a simple Google search. According to research by the dating site OkCupid, American men of all racial backgrounds find Asian women highly attractive. In fact, Asian-American women are the only racial group to score net positive ratings from men of all ethnic groups.
If you think about it, Lim’s argument is bizarre. If someone told me Italians were the most handsome, creative, and intelligent people in the world, I would click my heels, praise their good sense, and go about my day. But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success.
More deeply, however, Lim’s argument is that the very idea that Asians are “civilized, advanced and highly intelligent … [has] roots in white supremacy.” Really? I worked as a journalist in China for more than a year, and it was clear to me that the Chinese think of themselves as civilized, advanced, and highly intelligent. If anything, it’s a self-identity that has been accepted, not invented, by the West.
Furthermore, in America, that positive image is a factual reality. Asian-Americans have higher median income and education levels than any other racial group does. Contra Lim, Asian-Americans are not a “model minority,” they’re model citizens with strong family bonds, high educational attainment, and high economic productivity. There’s nothing wrong with that — in fact, it’s a major accomplishment to celebrate.
This Argument Ends In Banning Interracial Marriage
Unfortunately, while the essay sets up the premise that white supremacy lurks at the heart of the relationships between white men and Asian women, it fails to deliver a conclusion. I’ll fill it in for you. If we take Lim’s argument to its logical end (and reject the idea that logic itself is “white supremacist”), maybe she’s suggesting that white men who marry Asian women are, in the language of the sociological literature, “colonizing their bodies.”
Or maybe white men are simply using their privilege as the progenitors of global beauty standards to extend their patriarchal dominance over a favored minority race. Or, to read into Lim’s ominous invocation of Hitler, maybe it’s all a secret plot to resurrect the Axis alliance between the great European and Asian powers. Of course, the author doesn’t go this far — her essay is ridiculous enough — but there’s no way you can accept her premise without concluding at the very least that interracial marriage between white men and Asian women is somehow wrong.
I take this insinuation personally. I’m a white man married to an Asian-American woman. We have two children together. Like the civil rights leaders in the 1960s, I believe interracial marriage is a sign of social progress. At its best, marriage is about human love, which transcends all considerations of race, class, and identity. One might even consider it to be the fullest expression of the idea of e pluribus unum, which I support by any means necessary — through assimilation, marriage, and the bonds of mutual citizenship.
While there may be awkward moments as we traverse the boundaries of ethnic identity, I believe that interracial marriage makes us stronger as a nation and will slowly help stamp out the real racism that still exists in America. Rather than conflate interracial marriage with the poisonous ideology of white supremacy, we should celebrate it as it’s practiced by millions of Americans: as an expression of love, unity, and tolerance.
Articles Like This Make Everything Worse
Ultimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They’re bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them. They’re a miniscule fraction of the population — numbering in the thousands in a nation of 323 million — and deserve to be snubbed out of public life.
Sadly, articles like “white supremacists have an Asian fetish” are counterproductive, bringing them even greater attention and trivializing the real legacy of white supremacy, the original sin of American history. The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater editorial discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait. In the past year, the Times has published articles about a white supremacist’s wedding registry, whether black and white preschoolers can really be friends, and how “nachos” and “Nazi” share the same etymological origin. The coverage has been so over-the-top, you might even say The New York Times has a “white supremacy fetish.”
Luckily, America is moving forward, with or without the Times. Interracial marriage is a fast-rising trend and leading to broader social tolerance. The percentage of multiracial children born in the United States has increased from 1 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 2013. The social taboos against racial mixing have begun to fade and a majority of multiracial Americans are proud of their blended heritage and more open to other cultures.
On a final note of optimism: mixed-race people are actually seen as the most attractive of all racial types. Thus, if this trend continues, we may soon be able to say objectively that America has the most beautiful people in the world. That’s something worth fighting for.","['racially', 'charged', 'clickbait']"
"At the time, Moynihan was primarily concerned that irresponsible politicians promising their constituents an insupportable array of handouts would jeopardize America’s economic well-being. ",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/16/how-americas-looming-debt-crisis-could-spark-the-next-great-awakening/,federalist,student-debt,right,81.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"To say America appears headed for a destabilizing debt crisis is not the same as saying every cultural consequence will be negative. It could well lead to a mass religious revival.
The total of U.S. federal, state, and local debt, in combination with future spending commitments, foreshadows the most predictable financial disaster in human history. Washington’s obligations, growing at an estimated $1 trillion annually, now exceed $23 trillion, while neither of America’s two largest entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, are on sound footing.
Going down to the state and local levels, a May 2018 report by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government reveals that public pension funding in New Jersey and Kentucky is already at “high risk of insolvency,” with California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and several large cities close behind. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, at least 20 state public pension programs have no more than half the assets they need to pay promised benefits.
Ominous trends, to be sure. Yet to say America appears headed for a destabilizing debt crisis is not the same as saying every cultural consequence will be negative. History records many economic and social upheavals that ironically sparked a renaissance of neglected moral and spiritual values. Could our approaching brush with national insolvency really produce anything like a religious revival? There are admittedly good reasons to be skeptical.
Secularism has become so prevalent in the United States, especially within academic communities, it’s hard to imagine it ever dissipating. Mainline religious denominations have long been in retreat, with the percentage of self-described Protestants down from 51 percent to 43 percent in just the last decade and of Catholics from 23 percent to 20 percent over the same period. There also do not appear to be any contemporary theologians capable of doing what charismatic evangelists, such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, accomplished during the Great Awakening revivals of the 1730s and 1740s.
Yet the statistics on declining church attendance are too often confused with the number of believers. For while the percentage of Americans who claim no religious affiliation has jumped to 26 percent from 17 percent since 2009, more than half of these so-called nones say they still believe in God. Noting that outright atheists and agnostics make up only 9 percent of the U.S. population, Baylor University’s distinguished professor of history Philip Jenkins cautions against equating “no religious affiliation” with “no religious belief” or with the capacity of organized religion to reform and regenerate.
Fewer Government Programs Aids Character Development
If, indeed, the cultural pendulum, which has always swung between established faith and institutional skepticism, is more susceptible to a reversal than generally supposed, aspects of the debt crisis could both hasten and magnify the turn.
The first was anticipated nearly 35 years ago by Democratic New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in an address to St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Rochester, New York. Public borrowing, he warned the congregation, differs from private borrowing in a fundamental way: The government officials “who do the borrowing … are not the ones who will do the repaying.” As a result, they are tempted to use debt “not as a form of investment [in the country’s future],” but to buy votes from the beneficiaries of new programs.
At the time, Moynihan was primarily concerned that irresponsible politicians promising their constituents an insupportable array of handouts would jeopardize America’s economic well-being. But he also worried that the more government tries to provide for citizens’ material needs, the more it undermines the public’s faith in character development and in serving some idea of God. Instead of validating the precepts common to all religions, he warned, debt-fueled public spending “can, and frequently does, [promote] just the opposite.”
Moynihan never described the specific spiritual benefits that would arise from the kind of cutbacks needed to solve a future government debt crisis. But in explaining how excessive public spending undermines traditional values, he was clearly suggesting subsequent belt-tightening could have the reverse effect.
Debt Downfall May Encourage Traditional Religious Beliefs
A more recent study by Connecticut hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, for his book “Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises,” suggests a second spiritual effect of the coming debt crisis. After closely examining every recovery from the brink of a sovereign bankruptcy since ancient Greece, Dalio concluded all successful government bailouts have one necessary characteristic: The various social factions within the distressed country, from wealthy taxpayers to recipients of entitlement programs to public workers, must agree to put aside long-standing differences and share in the rescue. Not because the factions think their own sacrifice fair, but because dividing the financial pain is the only way to stop their habitual squabbling from morphing into a catastrophic civil war.
The implication for resolving our fiscal crisis is that the energies which today we so relentlessly focus on defeating perceived political enemies — be they progressives or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans, government bureaucrats or wealthy corporate executives — will eventually have to be redirected toward a stoic acceptance of mutual forfeiture. For many, this will mean being reconciled to higher taxes. For others, it will mean smaller government benefit checks, reduced public pension payouts, higher interest rates, reduced subsidies, or some combination of these.
This mutual acceptance of reduced economic expectation may not lead to a mass outbreak of “loving thy neighbor as thyself,” but it will require culturally elevating many traditionally religious beliefs: that people should be at their best when times are bad, that no one escapes a worldly trial, and that human institutions are never to be fully trusted. The spiritual wisdom of biblical figures who suffered unfairly — Joseph sold into slavery by his own brothers, Daniel locked in the lion’s den, and the Apostle Paul thrown into the late-night ocean — will likely have a much wider appeal.
Religion will also prove more attractive in a practical way. One of the underreported stories of the 2007-2008 financial crisis was the critical role various churches played in helping people cope with the abrupt collapse of home values, the big drop in retirement savings due to falling stock prices, and the subsequent tsunami of pink slips and salary cuts. Not only did every major denomination offer free classes on how better to handle money, but a February 2009 Lifeway Research survey of 1,000 American churches found that one-third had instituted or expanded food banks, employment bureaus, inexpensive medical services, or low-cost after-school programs for parishioners’ children.
A Better Public Education For a Third of the Price
A third spiritual consequence of the coming debt crisis will be the pressure it creates to lower the cost of local governments’ biggest expense, K-12 education, by subsidizing children to attend parochial schools. Although the argument for such a policy has traditionally been based on the superior academic quality of many religious schools, especially in big cities, the economic case is also remarkably compelling. In Hartford, Connecticut, for example, the per-pupil cost of a public elementary or middle-school placement is more than six times that of the average Christian or Hebrew school.
Of course, subsidizing families to voluntarily elect a religious education for their children would probably do little to advance religion if nonbelieving parents had no interest in the option. But research conducted by Christel J. Manning, a professor at Sacred Heart University, found that many adults who have stopped attending church or have rejected a belief in God still see religious schools as a better defender of the values they hold than typical public schools.
Grateful for any help they can get to counter mass media influence and student peer pressure, many such parents gladly elect a parochial placement for their child if a district or state policy subsidizes the option.
The Debt Crisis Raises Suspicions of Secularism
The final way in which the coming debt crisis will advance religion is by creating a terminal suspicion of what the philosopher Max Weber long ago recognized as secularism’s biggest selling point: the supposed ability to replace spiritual conceptions of reality with scientific laws powerful enough to improve not just the manufacturing of consumer goods, but society’s organization. “The fate of our times,” Weber famously wrote, is to be persuaded “by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world.”
Even though a century of government social engineering has consistently failed to deliver on secular promises to end poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, and many other problems — as Amity Shlaes documents so well in her new book “Great Society” — the belief in scientifically guided policymaking endures. All that is required to make its programs successful, the thinking goes, is more generous funding.
But how well can this argument hold up when there is no more money to spend? In other words, if what it takes to make social engineering effective exceeds what it takes to push a federal, state, or local government to the edge of bankruptcy, how is a secular culture any better than one relying on the moral and spiritual development of its people?
As the debt crisis unfolds, the idea of allowing social science to drive public policy, even if it were somehow affordable, will prove increasingly objectionable. For as Americans are already learning, many government programs are based on grossly misleading academic research, conducted by professors more interested in pleasing funders and colleagues than in getting to truth.
Are We on the Path to a Great Awakening?
So tenuous is today’s secular worldview, in fact, that the vast majority of supposedly “settled discoveries” in psychology, politics, anthropology, sociology, and even medicine cannot be replicated. “Most published research findings [in these areas] are false,” says John Ioannidis, co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford University.
Thus far, the consequences of what appears to be an astonishingly fictionalized reality have been mostly limited to conferences on how to salvage the academy’s tarnished reputation. But how will the public take to the idea of social engineering — and, more importantly, to the secular assumptions on which it is based — as the bill incurred for decades of fraudulently justified government regulation comes due? When science’s irreproducibility crisis meets the government debt crisis, must there not be a third crisis about the nature of conventionally accepted reality?
The effects of government belt-tightening on beneficiary values, the need for shared sacrifice, a resurgence of religious schooling, the economic limitation on social engineering, and the deeper unreliability of the pseudo-science upon which that engineering is based — will the combined consequences of America’s looming debt crisis be enough to spark its next Great Awakening? This is not a question we can answer until it happens, but neither is the prospect as far-fetched as it initially sounds.","['insupportable', 'irresponsible']"

TRUMP’S BASE A BLESSING AND A CURSE IN SHUTDOWN
President Trump initially wanted the blame for the current partial shutdown of the federal government, and he has surely gotten it.
After a weeks-long hiatus in polling because of Christmas and New Year’s, a slew of new surveys are out assessing the effectiveness of the two parties’ efforts to place blame for the shutdown and it’s not even close.
We’re going to focus on the freshest banana in the bunch, a new poll from Quinnipiac University. The survey found 56 percent of voters blame Trump and Republicans in Congress compared to 36 that blame Democrats.
By a more than two-to-one margin voters back a Democratic proposal to open parts of the government unrelated to the border security scrap. Opposition to “a wall” on the southern border remains essentially unchanged since the last Q Poll that was taken before the shutdown began.
It will be helpful to look most closely, though, at the sentiments of independent voters, and that is where the news is the most dire for Republicans. Just 29 percent would support Trump asserting emergency authority to construct a wall and 55 percent of independents hold that construction of such a barrier goes against American values.
When it comes to party unity, Democrats have the upper hand. While 93 percent of Democrats said they blame the other team, just 74 percent of Republicans are sticking with the red side. A quarter of Republicans either blame their own party or wouldn’t say what they thought.
But as we said at the outset, it’s not surprising that voters would tend to blame Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown that Trump said he would happily initiate and said he would keep going for months to come. But the data does reveal something interesting about the president’s political predicament. Looking at Republican views on the issues makes it clear how little latitude Trump has in dealing with his base.
The best news for the president and his party in the poll is that a majority of voters overall, including 54 independents, believe there is a security crisis on the Mexican border. But in his long effort to convince Americans about the danger of what he describes as the dregs of society coming across the southern border his own followers may have believed him too well.
Republicans take an extremely dim view of immigration legal or illegal compared to other Americans. Now, 88 percent of Republicans support building a border wall. Republicans are also the only demographic subset that believes illegal immigrants are more likely to commit other crimes. Only 24 percent of Republicans oppose the shutdown-for-wall formula that Trump has written. Fifty-two percent of Republicans oppose reopening the rest of the government unrelated to border security as negotiations continue.
In short, Trump has succeeded too well in convincing Republicans of the rightness of his position. Nearly 90 percent of self-identified Republicans say there is a crisis at the border. Taken in those stark terms, it becomes increasingly hard for Trump to negotiate without appearing to betray his loyalists and, by their reckoning, national security.
Trump said it’s the wall or nothing and Republicans rallied to his side. Unfortunately, that leaves him at odds with the 63 percent of the electorate that disagrees.
These numbers also help illuminate Democrats’ thinking: Since Trump has no wiggle room with his base, they are content to watch consequences pile up, driving Trump’s overall numbers further into the ditch.
In a fight over $3.1 billion that under normal circumstances could have been dispatched by simple arithmetic, the president now finds himself a victim of his own success.
THE RULEBOOK: REPUBLICS GO FARTHER
“As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand, and will include no greater number than can join in those functions…” – James Madison, Federalist No. 14
TIME OUT: V. 2019
Atlantic: “…while men used to be seen as begrudging participants, more so-called Instagram husbands are embracing the term and becoming an integral part of their partner’s business. One man on the front lines of this movement is Jordan Ramirez. When Ramirez, a tech entrepreneur, married Dani Austin, a lifestyle influencer with a quarter of a million followers, in 2018, the influencer world was still new to him. While Austin was jetting around the world shooting photos… Ramirez had a separate and unrelated career in the tech–start-up world. … Ramirez, like many other spouses who work in a full-time Instagram-husband capacity, has taken on operational and business aspects of his wife’s influencer business and taught himself photo editing to help with production. … In September, Ramirez launched The Instagram Husband Podcast, which is focused on telling the stories of the men behind the camera and redefining what it means to be an Instagram husband.”

TRUMP AGAIN BACKS OFF EMERGENCY DECLARATION
Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday appeared to rule out – at least for now – declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, setting aside one of the White House’s leading options for ending the 24-day partial government shutdown. … Trump also underscored his opposition to temporarily reopening the government while lawmakers try to come up with a bipartisan immigration agreement. The president shot down a proposal by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a staunch ally of the White House, to open the government for three weeks in a last-ditch effort to reach a legislative compromise before moving ahead with a national emergency declaration. … The president’s Monday comments are the latest indication that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history. Both sides have dug in, with Trump demanding more than $5 billion for the wall and Democrats insisting that a wall is expensive, unnecessary and ‘immoral.’”
Congressional GOP bewildered by White House - WaPo: “When President Trump made a rare journey to the Capitol last week, he was expected to strategize about how to end the government shutdown he instigated. Instead, he spent the first 20-odd minutes delivering a monologue about ‘winning.’… Trump was nevertheless confident on Saturday about his handling of the standoff. ‘I do have a plan on the Shutdown,’ he tweeted. ‘But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people.’”
State, local agencies squeezed by shutdown - USA Today: “State and local officials and the people they serve are increasingly feeling the pinch of the partial government shutdown. ‘We can't stop providing services. We are at ground zero,’ said Humboldt County, California, Supervisor Virginia Bass. ‘We keep doing more with less, but we can only do so much.’ From road projects to food stamps to preventing the next round of wildfires, effects of the shutdown are starting to hit home as politicians in the nation's capital wrestle over funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall. On average, about 33 percent of each state's revenue comes from the federal government.”
GILLIBRAND EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE RUN TUESDAY
CBS News: “Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, is expected to announce her plans to form a presidential exploratory committee on Tuesday's ‘Late Show with Stephen Colbert,’ according to a person familiar with her planning. Gillibrand is scheduled to appear on the CBS late night program on Tuesday night. If she announces her exploratory committee, as expected, she would become the second U.S. senator — and second female senator — to announce plans to begin the legal process of running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. The 52-year old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of President Trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017.”
Bernie staffs up - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is adding firepower to his political team ahead of a potential 2020 campaign, locking down digital alumni who were key to his surprise performance in 2016 and recruiting the media production company that helped launch Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to prominence. The flurry of activity, detailed by four people familiar with the campaign’s thinking, is the latest sign that the Vermont senator is closing in on a decision on a second run for the White House. … The behind-the-scenes moves underscore one of Sanders’ key strengths: He is poised to enter the Democratic primary field with a digital operation and social media army that outpaces virtually any other candidate, at least for now. For all the attention on Beto O’Rourke’s online dominance last year, only Sanders would start the campaign on the foundation of a full-fledged, grassroots presidential campaign.”
Pushing $15 minimum wage - Fox Business: “Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said he – along with other members of Congress – plans to introduce a bill in Congress this week that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The bill is expected to come as the government shutdown enters its fourth week – eclipsing the record for the longest lapse in federal funding over the weekend – as many federal employees go unpaid. Raising the minimum wage sparks a range of opinions on Capitol Hill – from whether it should be raised at all to whose job it should be to do so. Such a bill is unlikely to make significant headway because, even though Democrats took control of the House of Representatives during the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans maintain control in the Senate.”
It’s go time - AP: “After months of speculation and secrecy, the 2020 presidential primary season is about to explode. With several Democrats already in the race, a half dozen more are locking down final travel, staffing and strategy to launch White House bids in the coming weeks. While plans may change, the announcements are expected to come in waves, the first featuring a group of ambitious Senate Democrats including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who face pressure to join the race after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s entrance two weeks ago. The second wave will likely feature political heavyweights like former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke, whose advisers believe they have sufficient financial backing and name recognition to join the crowded field on their terms later in the first quarter should they decide to run.”
Welcome to the 2020 Twitter Primary - HuffPo: “…[It] seems pretty clear that Twitter is going to be important in the 2020 election. Why? Because despite all of the anger and nonsense, Twitter is where journalists and activists hang out. … So [journalist James O’Malley] went to work, downloading data on the followers of six front-running Democrats ― Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas). [He] also worked out who their followers follow, giving [him] a detailed picture of what Beto Twitter looks like compared to Warren Twitter, and so on.”
IS FLORIDA DRIFTING AWAY FROM DEMS?
NYT: “After a painful midterm election for Florida Democrats that showed this crucial swing state drifting away from them, a group of party activists gathered at a Cuban restaurant last month to receive some bitter medicine — and a sober warning — to go with their croquettes and plantain chips. Democrats started organizing Latino voters too late, didn’t tailor their message for an increasingly diverse community and ultimately took Latino support for granted, a Florida pollster told about 50 members of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Broward County. Democrats will lose again in 2020 if they don’t move swiftly to win over Hispanics, the pollster, Eduardo Gamarra, told the group. ‘You just need to start now,’ he said. With the swearing-in last Tuesday of two newly elected Republican leaders, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Senator Rick Scott, Florida has become a more reliably red political bastion, making the path to Electoral College victory that much tougher for the 2020 Democratic nominee.”
The suburbs delivered for Dems in 2018. Will the party return the favor? - Daily Beast: “The Democratic Party’s triumphal romp through suburbia was the big story of the midterms. In 2016 the suburbs, home to the majority of American voters, voted 50 to 45 for Donald Trump; this year, 52 percent went Democratic. … The suburbs are where most Americans, including roughly four in five residents of our largest metropolitan areas, live. Historically, they have favored Republicans in most elections. But that tie has been weakened for reasons including the growing diversity of these areas and revulsion at Trump, particularly among educated women. The trouble, however, is that progressives, for the most part, love density and disdain suburbs. They have recently espoused calls, for example, to ban single-family zoning altogether in deep blue Minneapolis—with the entire state of Oregon considering a ban of its own.”
The fake news will be homegrown for 2020 - NYT: “Fight-fire-with-fire reasoning is bubbling up on the left as the social media giants continue to struggle to stop distortion campaigns in real time. It was only after The Times and The Washington Post reported on the Alabama operations that Facebook shut down the suspect accounts. None of this bodes well for the 2020 campaign, which has entered its first stage at a time when analysts in and out of government are still trying to determine the full effect disinformation had in the last presidential election.”

AUDIBLE: A TRUE TEAM PLAYER
“We got Scotch tape, the clear kind.” – Solomon Lartey, a career government official whose job is to go through piles of torn up documents, ripped up by the president and taping them back together.
FROM THE BLEACHERS
“I agree with your take on President Lincoln and LOVE the phrase ‘hot take aficionado’ which I think is defined as ‘one who works hard to find outrage and schadenfreude in just about everything, especially historical events.’ I think some kind of ‘Hot Take Aficionados Anonymous’ may be in order for our current civilization. My life is getting a lot happier since I stopped attacking total strangers on Facebook and just started responding to arguments by saying, ‘disagree, but I love you, man!.’ Actually, it’s becoming even better since I took out the ‘disagree’ part and just respond ‘I love you.’ Keep up the good work! I could do a lot worse in life than to always ask myself ‘would Chris Stirewalt send this email?’” – Brian D. Liddicoat, Watsonville, Calif.
[Ed. note: This is the highest praise I can imagine, Mr. Liddicoat. And generally the answer for anything snarky or nasty has to be “no.” But sometimes I fail my own standards and end up deepening enmity rather than binding up wounds – and my regret in doing so always far outlasts the momentary pleasure I feel at tearing down an adversary. The best ones, of course, are the ones I just toss into the “drafts” folder and forget. I love Dana Perino’s idea for a book: “Tweets I Never Sent.”]
“I read one report that said there was bi-partisan legislation to end the shutdown but McConnell wouldn’t allow it to be brought up for a vote. I read another article that said McConnell wouldn’t bring it up for a vote because he thought it didn’t have enough votes to pass and that Trump wouldn’t sign it anyway. He didn’t want to waste anyone’s time. I appreciate the time concept but I would like to hear the suggestions and see who votes which way. Is there a mechanism to get around McConnell to bring a vote to the floor? That seems like an awful lot of control in the hands of one person. Very much enjoy hearing your in-depth research on these topics.” – Dani Marquardt, Carol Stream, Ill.
[Ed. note: Good question, Ms. Marquardt! McConnell’s concern here is that good compromises mean hard votes for individual senators. Imagine you were a Republican senator representing a blue state. You’re facing huge pressure from your constituents to end the shutdown, but you’re also worried about your right flank and a possible primary challenge or a feud with the president. You might be willing to vote for a compromise that would upset the GOP base, but only if it would pass and be signed into law. If the deals on offer wouldn’t pass or if the president would veto them there’s no incentive for McConnell to put his own members in political jeopardy over a symbolic vote. McConnell has been up front about the matter from the start: only when the Democratic House and the Republican president have come to a deal will he wade back into those alligator-infested waters. Running doomed legislation would actually reduce the chances of making a deal in the end.]
“It’s all a lie! Since the amnesty of 1986 the Dems and GOP have failed to do as promised! Secure the border, Make E-Verify mandatory [not just implement it!] address the loophole in the 14th Amendment to stop ‘anchor babies’ and pass laws where one must prove legal status to apply for and receive social services and enroll children in our schools! If Obama could declare through executive order an illegal act named DACA [going around Congress who has authority regarding immigration matters] then President Trump can damn sure declare a National Emergency with regards to the invasion of our country by 100's of thousands thru our Southern border!” – J.C. Palmer, Oacoma, S.D.
[Ed. note: I’m not sure who you think is lying, but just in case it’s us, I would point out that we explained at length that Trump certainly has the power to declare an emergency. But “can” and “should” are obviously two different questions. We don’t get into “should” questions too much here. Our readers and our fellow Americans all need to sort out “should” questions their own and don’t need us telling them what to think. But if the president does attempt to build on the constitutional transgressions of presidents past he will certainly face political consequences. There would also be consequences for our already weak legislative branch. The president’s challenge is that for voters who, like you, believe that America is facing an existential threat from immigrants from Latin America, any compromise might be perceived as some kind of betrayal. Trump benefits from the intense loyalty of such voters but is left with few options for actually governing. That leads him, like his predecessor, to consider extra-constitutional measures. The greatest trick that American politicians have pulled in our time is to use their inability to work through our system as an excuse for working around it. We’ve set the bar so low for competent governance that we are only too willing to entertain such ideas, whether it’s a $1 trillion coin or a sudden state of emergency, because politicians tell us that doing the ordinary work of governing is just too hard.]
“Hello again from a former West Virginian. Today I found myself defending your objectivity and honor in an email exchange with a liberal friend. I reminded him that both political parties courted Dwight Eisenhower prior to the 1952 presidential election. I further commented that Joe Manchin could be an electable candidate for either party— excepting the far left and the far right! Does this observation warrant consideration of a third party candidate? What say you?” – Roger Plauché, Sedona, Ariz.
[Ed. note: I’m glad you’ve got my back, cousin! I think for a candidate not from one of the two major parties they would need enormous resources. One area where the parties still work together is to make it extremely hard for outsiders to get on the ballot. An independent candidate would need to start now and do so with an organization large enough to jump through all the legal hoops – petition drives, etc. – to be ready for a credible run in 2020.]
“G’day Chris. ‘. . .Democracies tend toward kingship in almost every case’ A bit of a sweeping statement surely? Be helpful if you could enlarge upon your this a little? (I assume by ‘kingship’ you mean authoritarianism - or even dictatorship?) The old democracy of the UK tending to toward ‘kingship’ (your version) when it already is a constitutional monarchy? Or New Zealand - also an older democracy which now has PR? Or even Canada? I see no evidence (yet) of tending toward ‘dictatorship.’” – Mike O'Neill, New Zealand
[Ed. note: G’day again, Mr. O’Neill! I take your question thusly: What about countries that move from kingship toward democracy? I would say that Britain and then Commonwealth nations like yours have been republican rather than democratic in nature for most of the past century. I see your country, Canada, Australia and Britain still striving for balance between republican restraint and democratic energy. But when too many people feel like they are shut out by those republican restraints, you will see the rise of purer forms of democracy. And in almost every case where such a movement takes hold – the former Soviet Union and Iran for example – the tendency is toward democratic majorities backing authoritarian rule. You know the old joke “one man, one vote, one time.” Or my favorite “Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.” So what’s the lifespan of a republic before it’s undone by the sort of majoritarian mob mentality that’s taking hold in America? Depends on how good the believers in republicanism are at making their case. There are still William Tafts and Calvin Coolidges among us, but they had better get busy.]

‘GOAT FUND ME’
AP: “The threat of catastrophic wildfires has driven a Northern California town to launch a ‘Goat Fund Me’ campaign to bring herds of goats to city-owned land to help clear brushes. Nevada City in the Sierra Nevada began the online crowdsourcing campaign last month with the goal of raising $30,000 for the project. The campaign explains that because it takes time to secure grant funding, the town needs money now to hire local goat ranchers because they're only available this winter. City officials say the ranchers have already rented out their herds to other municipalities the rest of the year. Vice Mayor Reinette Senum told The Los Angeles Times the town's 450 acres of greenbelt makes it especially vulnerable to fires. She says ‘if we don't help ourselves, no one else is going to step up.’”
AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“[President Obama] is too smart not to understand geopolitics; he simply doesn’t care. In part because his priorities are domestic. In part because he thinks we lack clean hands and thus the moral standing to continue to play international arbiter.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Aug. 18, 2016.

"While his supporters have included many strains of nationalism and populism, he did run as a Republican, and this will hopefully work in his favor. Many Americans are hopeful, excited, and looking forward to a Trump presidency. Here are some of the reasons why.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/4-reasons-look-forward-trump-presidency/,federalist,trump-presidency,right,81.0,3.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump is our next president. Despite the anxiety in some parts of the country, there may be a number of bright spots ahead.
While it’s certainly wise to glance behind us and see how Donald Trump became so popular, not to mention how hardly anyone predicted Trump would win the presidency, it’s also beneficial to look ahead at what a Trump presidency may look like.
While his supporters have included many strains of nationalism and populism, he did run as a Republican, and this will hopefully work in his favor. Many Americans are hopeful, excited, and looking forward to a Trump presidency. Here are some of the reasons why.
1. A Republican Congress May Direct His Ambitions
Also contrary to election predictions, Republicans maintained a majority in both the House and Senate, at 238-193 and 51-47, respectively. That’s not all. In several surprising upsets, Republican opponents beat veteran Democrats like Senate candidates Russ Feingold and Evan Bayh. The so-called “Silent Majority” didn’t just show up to vote for Trump, but let their disgust at the political establishment trickle down to smaller races. Collectively these races added up to a Republican majority in Congress, which might do well for Trump for several reasons.
Trump has never held political office, and often parts of his agenda seemed vague. However, Trump also says what he thinks, which sometimes manifests as a lack of self-control.
Even as president, however, Trump luckily can’t do whatever he wants: the checks and balances that separation of powers provides exist for a reason. A Republican Congress with House Speaker Paul Ryan at the helm may guide Trump’s agenda and hold the reins when Trump feels tempted to respond impulsively.
With a commander-in-chief who purports to be on his side ideologically, Ryan may be able to accomplish some of the things Democrats have repeatedly filibustered, and for which he’s earned a somewhat-marred reputation (Two words, Ryan: omnibus bill.). Sen. Mike Lee already says he can’t wait to get started:
I congratulate President-Elect Trump & look forward to helping him repeal Obamacare, reduce regulation, and confirm conservative judges. — Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) November 9, 2016
No doubt this will be challenging for both Trump and Congress, but if one hones the other, like iron sharpens iron, it could make for a very sharp double-edged sword.
2. A Solid Supreme Court Appointment
For many conservatives like myself who were hesitant to board the “Trump train,” one of the sparkling gems in the crown of a Trump presidency was the idea that maybe, just maybe Trump would elect a conservative Supreme Court justice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia’s vacant seat. One of the reasons I asked readers back in February to consider Trump was that we already knew without a doubt what kind of SCOTUS appointment Hillary Clinton would make. For example, her husband appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the lioness of liberalism on the court.
While we don’t exactly know what Trump will do with this, we’re hoping he chooses based on his own suggested list, which, as fellow Federalist Senior Contributor Illya Shapiro noted in this piece Tuesday, was encouraging. In fact, some might say Trump’s list for SCOTUS was like a Christmas list for conservatives. All we can hope is Trump replies, “Yes, Virginia, there is a constitutionally conservative SCOTUS justice,” and it will feel like Christmas morning.
We also already know Trump doesn’t like Obamacare and has said “on day one” he would repeal it, since he doesn’t want Americans to “suffer under the incredible economic burden” of the Affordable Care Act. (Even if you don’t like Trump, you have to agree with that.) With a Trump presidency and a conservative SCOTUS appointment, that dream just may become a reality. For conservatives, we’re not in Kansas anymore, and that’s a good thing.
3. Trump Could Reduce PC Pressure
Trump’s refusal to abide by the dictates of political correctness appealed to many voters. His supporters loved this, while Clinton added it as a weapon in her arsenal. At a Trump rally I attended in Virginia in August, one of the most common words of praise for Trump, next to his nationalism, was his ability to say what he thinks without regard to political correctness.
Of course, Trump took a lot of heat for this, not only for remarks that seemed racist, sexist, and misogynist, but also because the simplicity of his speech made him sound uninformed at best, stupid at worst. That didn’t matter; he pressed on.
Our culture is drowning in PC speech, especially on our college campuses, which even rolled out more safe spaces due to Trump’s win Tuesday. This Yale professor made an exam optional in case his students were upset. So a lack of politically correct language might be akin to a breath of fresh air in a boys’ dorm room. After eight years of a president unwilling and unable to call jihadism what it is—an extremist Muslim group that hates and wants to eradicate Western culture and religion—even after several jihadi mass shootings, a president who calls out Islamists may make America safer again.
People even found the way Trump expressed his immigration policies to be a welcome respite from the usual mantra that all are welcome, even the ones who live here illegally. The idea of building a wall he forces Mexico to pay for may be silly, but many agreed with his ideas that suspending our nation’s laws for preferred categories of illegal immigrants should end, detention for immigrants entering illegally should be enforced, and mandate “nationwide E-Verify for all new hires in the United States as a means to exclude illegal immigrants from employment.” Sound harsh? It sounds the opposite of politically correct, and that’s part of why Trump won this election.
4. A Trump Presidency Could Reignite the GOP
I could be wrong about all of the above. Trump may find his job as president challenging. He could: tweet strange things at 2 a.m., appoint terrible advisors for national security, make allies enemies and enemies allies, and, if he influences the economy the way he runs his hotels, that might tank too. Maybe Trump will force this country toward a downward spiral politically, economically, and morally at a rate no one has seen before. Maybe the United States, in particular its Republicans, will reach the end of their rope and finally look to the heavens and ask: What is conservatism? Then, and maybe only then, will they figure it out.
Like putting a displaced limb back into joint, this would look and feel painful. But if Trump incurs damage via the White House, that brokenness may be what is necessary to finally straighten out what conservatives believe and to heal this country from the inside out. Right now, based on how the GOP behaved this last year, this outcome seems the least likely, but four years of a Trump presidency that out-maneuvers everything laid out above could contribute to a more insightful GOP.
In all, many conservatives may not have chosen Trump as their candidate, and certainly liberals didn’t. But a little over half of the country did choose him. Could some of these things develop in the next four years and actually “Make America Great Again?” Time will tell.","['hopeful', 'excited', 'hopefully']"
"It should be clear by now that no matter how bad the violence gets, López Obrador is not going to do anything about the cartels.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/06/its-time-for-the-united-states-to-wage-war-on-mexican-drug-cartels/?utm_source=deployer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newslink&utm_term=members&utm_content=20191231151341,federalist,gun-control,right,81.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The slaughter of an American family in Mexico is the latest sign that violence in Mexico is out of control and the U.S. needs to step in.
The American family gunned down Monday in northern Mexico should be a wake-up call for U.S. policymakers that the spiraling cartel violence in Mexico is not going to remain south of the Rio Grande, and that the time has come to fight back against the cartels—unilaterally, if need be.
The brazen daylight ambush, in which at least six children and three women from a Mormon community near the U.S.-Mexico border were killed, is the latest flashpoint in the growing instability of the Mexican state and the country’s descent into warlordism.
Simply put, some areas of Mexico are under the de facto control of drug cartels. Last month, hundreds of gunmen with the Sinaloa cartel besieged the city of Culiacan after Mexican National Guard troops arrested one of the sons of the infamous drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera. In a stunning display of coordination and overwhelming force, cartel gunmen eventually forced the military to release El Chapo’s son and surrender, a decision Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador later defended.
Monday’s attack, in the northern Mexican state of Sonora, targeted the LeBarón family, members of a Mormon community of dual Mexican and American citizens who have lived in the border region for decades. It was unclear why the caravan of three vehicles came under fire, but gruesome news reports detailed the intentional slaughter of defenseless women and children, some of whom were burned to death inside their vehicles. Family members told The New York Times that one child was gunned down while running away.
Mexico Is Refusing to Fight the Cartels
President Trump on Tuesday called on President López Obrador to wage war on the cartels, “wipe them off the face of the earth,” and offered America’s assistance, saying it sometimes takes “an army to defeat an army.”
This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2019
López Obrador was quick to decline the offer. “It’s not in agreement with our convictions. The worst thing is war,” he said, echoing slogans he often repeats about cartel violence and ending the drug war like, “Hugs, not gunshots,” and “You can’t fight fire with fire.”
Upon winning the presidency last year, López Obrador all but declared an end to the drug war, saying he would instead tackle the “root causes” of cartel violence, which he claims are poverty and lack of opportunity. His main security policy has been the creation of the National Guard, a 60,000-strong force largely comprised of military and naval police, as well as former officers from Mexico’s famously corrupt federal police. It was a contingent of National Guard troops that was defeated by Sinaloa gunmen in Culiacan, and to date the force has mostly been used to patrol the northern and southern borders in effort to crack down on illegal immigration from Central America.
But in the aftermath of the battle of Culiacan and this week’s massacre of American women and children in Sonora, López Obrador’s left-wing platitudes and lackluster policies ring hollow. Mexico is now facing record-breaking levels of violence as the cartels grow more assertive in the face of government inaction. It should be clear by now that no matter how bad the violence gets, López Obrador is not going to do anything about the cartels.
It’s Time to Sanction Mexican Elites
That means the United States is going to have to act. For America, this is a matter of national security, and should be approached as such. One way or another, order must be imposed on northern Mexico, and if Mexico City will not do it, then Washington will have to.
What would that look like, practically speaking? An invasion and occupation of northern Mexico by the U.S. Army, like the Pershing Expedition a hundred years ago? In Trump’s phrase, an army to defeat an army? Not quite—or at least not yet.
In the near-term, U.S. policymakers must understand that while the cartels to some extent exist as a kind of parallel state alongside the Mexican state, they are also to a large degree intertwined with the Mexican state. Many Mexican elites, whether state governors or federal officials in Mexico City, are caught up in cartel activities by virtue of the cartels’ involvement in a wide array of commercial activities that go well beyond drug trafficking. Over the past decade, the cartels have branched out into oil and gas theft, industrial agriculture, offshore commercial fishing, and most recently, the mass smuggling of Central American migrants to the southwest U.S. border, an enterprise that generates billions annually.
These activities don’t take place without some collusion with at least part of Mexican officialdom. Evidence abounds. In 2017, for example, four state governors, all of them members of then-President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, were arrested on drug trafficking charges. Indeed, Pena Nieto’s PRI party was plagued with scandal and corruption throughout his tenure in office.
No wonder then, that upon assuming office in 2012 Pena Nieto ended the practice of vetting senior officials with the United States, a crucial part of his predecessor Felipe Calderon’s war on the cartels. Also no wonder that during the criminal trial of El Chapo last year there was testimony about large bribes paid directly to Pena Nieto and senior military officers.
Corruption, in other words, is rotting the Mexican state from within. Cartel gun battles, ambushes, and a skyrocketing murder rate are simply the outward manifestations of this rot. Given the complicity of Mexican elites with the cartel underworld, the proper U.S. response is to target those elites with sanctions.
We already impose such sanctions on regime-connected individuals in places like Iran and Venezuela, and there’s similar precedent in elements of Plan Columbia in the 1990s. In these cases, the point of sanctions is to weaken the regime. In Mexico, the point would be to strengthen the regime by targeting elements within it that undermine state sovereignty.
There are plenty of pressure points the United States could apply to these individuals, who are vulnerable to the same kinds of pressures we exert on rogue states all the time—sanctions, confiscation of property, barring access to American institutions. Make no mistake, members of the Mexican elite enjoy and to some extent rely upon American banks and financial institutions to manage their wealth. They send their children to elite American universities, they own real estate in America, and often travel here for health care.
Cut off access to all of that—exile corrupt elites from American territory and institutions, and thus take the fight directly the cartels’ patrons and accomplices.
There’s no need to limit our policy options to drug interdiction at the border and intelligence sharing with Mexican authorities. By targeting, publicly naming, and sanctioning individual Mexicans known to be complicit in cartel activities, the United States would be putting the government of President López Obrador on notice that ignoring the cartels isn’t going to cut it. Not anymore.","['should', 'clear']"
"So it was creepy when Obama was trying to replace American idealism with progressivism and calling it “economic patriotism,” and it’s creepy when Trump does basically the same thing under the guise of economic nationalism.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/24/trumps-national-day-patriotic-creepy/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,82.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"First it was 'economic patriotism.' Now it's 'economic nationalism.' Stop telling us how to be patriotic.
Politicians have no business directing or defining patriotism — especially when their rhetoric sounds like 1950s-era Soviet sloganeering.
It was creepy when Barack Obama declared his first inauguration day a “National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation” and “called” on us to find “common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century.” And it’s creepy when Donald Trump declares his inauguration day a “National Day of Patriotic Devotion;” one in which “a new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart.”
You can find both, unfortunately, in the Federal Register.
This kind of self-aggrandizement is what you see under cults of personality, not American republicanism. Far be it from me to lecture anyone on how to love his country, but if your devotion to America is contingent on the party in office, you’re probably not doing it like the Founders envisioned. It’s bad enough that these inaugurations are treated as coronations. It can’t be patriotic to treat politicians like quasi-religious figures. Moreover, it ties patriotism — either implicitly, or in some cases rather explicitly — to a preferred set of policy initiatives or a political office.
We just survived eight years of a messianic presidency, with a finger-wagging, patriotism-appropriating administration lecturing us on how to be proper Americans. If you didn’t support the administration’s point of view, Joe Biden might accuse you of “betting against America.”
“What we need as a nation,” then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, echoing the president, wrote to a Republican Congress in 2014, “is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise or fall together.” Was Lew talking about our unalienable right to free expression? No, he was talking about punishing America-based companies that were trying to lower their tax burden, which happens to be one of the highest rates in the free world.
If we’re going to play this game, by the way, avoiding excessive taxation is also one of the most American things we can do.
So it was creepy when Obama was trying to replace American idealism with progressivism and calling it “economic patriotism,” and it’s creepy when Trump does basically the same thing under the guise of economic nationalism.
Now, judging from the campaign rhetoric, failing to support tariffs or other counterproductive “buy American” economic policies will have you branded seditious over the next four years. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who probably had something to do with the devotion order, has referred to himself as “economic nationalist,” a loaded term that means you only love your country if you support mercantilism. Economic nationalists rely on a populism that lays blame on others — Mexico, China, whoever — for American problems. It’s a philosophy, if we listen to Bannon or Trump, that values power over most principles, including liberty. So it sounds like many things, none of them American patriotism.
The idea is amorphous, but patriotism, especially in this country, is driven by idealism rather than chauvinism, ethnicity, or “power.” As George Orwell famously noted, nationalism isn’t the same as patriotism. In the American sense, patriotism is a fidelity to a place and the Constitution, and is by its nature “defensive, both militarily and culturally.” Nationalism, on the other hand, “is inseparable from the desire for power.” A devotional to our “new national pride” strongly hints at the latter.
You can hate your president and love your country. You can hope your president fails and still be patriotic. We don’t always have a “shared purpose.” That’s because presidents are not only commanders in chief, they are politicians with agendas. And sometimes those agendas clash with your worldview. Let’s not have devotionals venerating of their ascendency every four years.",['creepy']
Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule.,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/m-blC792hwU/,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,82.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"The United Nations Humanitarian Affairs office warned on Monday that nearly a million Syrian civilians from northwest Idlib province had been displaced in a Russia-backed offensive there by dictator Bashar al-Assad that began in December.
Idlib is the last stronghold of the anti-Assad rebel movement in the country. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Conversely, rebel groups have faced allegations that they have cooperated with Sunni jihadist organizations, as the anti-Assad movement largely consists of Arab Sunnis opposed to the Shiite Alawite rule in Damascus.
While the struggle between Assad and Sunni rebels lies at the heart of the Syrian Civil War, as many as ten different factions have participated in violence in the country during the war, often unrelated to Assad such as the failed establishment of the Islamic State caliphate in Raqqa or clashes between the northern Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) and the Turkish military. Turkey claims to oppose Assad’s rule but has instead focused its energy on fighting the Kurds, who have not had any significant interaction with Assad’s army and instead largely contributed to the demise of ISIS.
The vacuum left by the fall of ISIS in the country has allowed Assad, along with allies Iran and Russia, to focus on attacking Idlib.
“The violence in north-west Syria is indiscriminate,” Mark Lowcock, U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief, said on Monday. “We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.”
Refugees from the region “are traumatized and forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures because camps are full,” he noted. “Mothers are burning plastic to keep children warm … babies and small children are dying because of the cold.”
Lowcock added that schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure has been destroyed. Exposure to nature while fleeing also leaves open the potential of a significant public health crisis in the event of disease spreading, he added.
He estimated that 900,000 people had been displaced since December 1. A week ago, the number of displaced in the region stood at 690,000 since December 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which estimated it was the largest number of displaced people in a single period of the Syrian Civil War. The sum is particularly jarring given that the U.N. estimates the Idlib region is home to 3 million people.
Lowcock urged U.N. Security Council action and a ceasefire to protect civilians.
Anadolu Agency, the state news agency of anti-Assad Turkey, claimed this week that the number was much higher – nearly 2 million displaced from Idlib since January. Anadolu claimed that rebels and Assad troops had declared a ceasefire recently that Assad had not respected; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened more military action against Assad in the near future.
As of this week, the United Nations estimates that over 5.6 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011. Another 6.6 million are internally displaced, meaning they have lost their homes to the war and are either living homeless in cities or living in overcrowded refugee camps. The vast majority of those, over 3 million, who have left the country have fled to Turkey. Others in the new wave of displaced have fled to Manbij, Syrian Kurdistan. Local forces affiliated with the Kurdish fighters there have reported numbers too large to count of incoming refugees this month.
The Russian government has previously responded to United Nations reports on its atrocities in Syria by dismissing their information as false.
“They say the particular date a school or a hospital was destroyed in a particular region. They give coordinates. Our people start to double-check this and they find that there is no hospital with such coordinates, there is no school with such coordinates and the day which is mentioned by the U.N. humanitarian agencies, on this day, the Russian air force did not act at all,” Russian United Nations representative Gennady Gatilov complained in August, in response to yet another U.N. report accusing Moscow of helping Assad attack civilians. Gatilov claimed that biased NGOs on the ground provided the U.N. with misinformation.
This week, Russia has focused instead of accusing the United States of human rights violations.
“The oil fields … are controlled by the U.S. There’s shameless, impudent pillage of the wealth that belongs to Syria and the Syrian people taking place,” Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed in Rome this week, referring to territories liberated from the Islamic State and managed by Syrian Kurdish groups.
The Assad regime’s state propaganda outlet, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), claimed that, rather than terrorizing civilians, Assad has instead created a “humanitarian corridor” in Idlib for those who wish to leave.
“SANA reporter said that tens of citizens, most of them women, children, and elderly persons, exited through the humanitarian corridor established by the Syrian Arab Army west the liberated city of Ma’arat al-Nu’man, coming from the areas where the terrorists are positioned,” the outlet reported. SANA uses the term “liberated” to refer to cities under Assad control.
SANA also claimed Assad was providing medicine and food.

The American president’s threat to reverse that decision and impose the metals tariffs is the latest example of his mercurial approach to trade policy.,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/12/02/u-s-considers-tariffs-on-2-4-billion-in-french-products-over-digital-tax/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,international-politics-and-world-news,right,82.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is proposing tariffs on up to $2.4 billion worth of French imports — including Roquefort cheese, handbags, lipstick and sparkling wine — in retaliation for France’s tax on American tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative charged Monday that France’s new digital services tax discriminates against U.S. companies. The trade office will accept public comments on the tariffs, which could hit 100%, through Jan. 6 and hold a hearing Jan. 7.
The French tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by putting headquarters in low-tax European Union countries. It imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenues of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros.
The U.S. also criticized the French tax for targeting companies’ revenue, not their profits, and for being retroactive.
The decision to pursue tariffs “sends a clear signal that the United States will take action against digital tax regimes that discriminate or otherwise impose undue burdens on U.S. companies,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.
His agency investigated the French tax under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 — the same provision the Trump administration used last year to probe China’s technology policies, leading to tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports in the biggest trade war since the 1930s.
Lighthizer warned that the U.S. is also exploring whether to pursue Section 301 investigations into digital taxes introduced by Austria, Italy and Turkey.
The decision to target France got bipartisan endorsement from Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden. In a joint statement, they assailed the French digital tax as “unreasonable, protectionist and discriminatory.”
The tech trade group ITI said it welcomed the administration’s decision and urged continued negotiations on international taxes under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The tariff announcement is likely to increase tension between the United States and Europe. The U.S. is already readying tariffs on $7.5 billion in EU imports over illegal subsidies for the European aircraft giant Airbus. The World Trade Organization on Monday gave the U.S. a greenlight to impose those levies, ruling that the EU had not complied with an order to end the subsidies.
And in another reminder that Washington’s trade conflicts extend well beyond a 16-month standoff with China, President Donald Trump on Monday pledge to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina.
Both South American nations were among a group of U.S. allies that Trump exempted from steel and aluminum tariffs in March 2018. The American president’s threat to reverse that decision and impose the metals tariffs is the latest example of his mercurial approach to trade policy.
Trump accused the countries of manipulating their currencies lower to make their exports less expensive in world markets and gain an unfair trade advantage.
But the countries’ weak currencies reflect their weak economies. Brazil is contending with double-digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession. Argentina is battling an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation, huge debts and widespread poverty.",['mercurial']
"The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/23/how-anti-white-rhetoric-is-fueling-white-nationalism/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,82.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea.
I opened Twitter recently and saw 20+ notifications. Most of the time that means the new generation of white nationalist Twitter trolls are filling my feed with racist and anti-Semitic cartoons. It was the trolls, but this was different. They were celebrating my use of the word “anti-white” in a tweet. They saw it as a victory that a “mainstream conservative” was using this term that for so long has been their calling card.
They had a point. Until recently I would have been unlikely to use the term. Not because I didn’t believe some people harbored animosity towards whites, but because that was a fringe attitude removed from power, which represented little real threat. That is no longer the case. Progressive rhetoric on race has turned an ugly corner and the existence of “anti-white” attitudes can no longer be ignored.
In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Loosely backed up by historical inequities and disparities in mass shootings, this position has begun to take a serious foothold.
Don’t Ask White People to Be More Tribal
Strikingly, this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.
Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race.
White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. The last thing our society needs is for white people to feel more tribal. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.
A big part of the reason white Americans have been willing to go along with policies that are prejudicial on their face, such as affirmative action, is that they do not view themselves as a tribe. Given the inequality of resources favoring whites in our society, it is a good thing that white people view themselves as the ones without an accent. Should that change, white privilege (whatever one views that to be) will not be eviscerated—it will be entrenched.
The Tipping Point of Whiteness
All of this comes at a time when the last immigrants from the great wave of white immigration from 1850-1920 have died off. In the past, most whites identified with their European ethnicity: Irish, Italian, German, etc. As white people gravitate away from such identities, many see themselves as a neutral, “non racial” population. The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as “white,” but it is far preferable to the alternative: an American white population that views itself as a special-interest group.
The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as ‘white,’ but it is far preferable to the alternative.
The recurring, tired refrain that we should have a white history month if there is a black history month, or white student unions on campuses, is unintentionally being given new life by the Left. Celebrations or organizations of whiteness do not exist because we don’t need them. White people do not face the same kinds of systemic discrimination that people of color do. But progressives are doing a very good job of convincing white people that they do.
When parents of Virginia high school students complained about a white privilege video being shown to their kids, they rightfully noted that their kids were being singled out based on their race. The video featured a foot race in which people of color were burdened by impediments while the white people ran free. It was absolutely fair for them to interpret this as a message to their kids saying, “Your accomplishments are easier and less valuable than those of your peers of color.”
Many parents object to this method of teaching about race relations. While some white people, especially those in the academy and the arts, find the acceptance of privilege and its associated guilt liberating, many do not. Privilege theory is also not being offered as one of many ways to confront and consider racism; it is being offered as the central way. This was brilliantly explored in 2010 by the Midwestern Critical Whiteness Collective’s (MCWC’s) article in Harvard Education Review, “McIntosh as Synecdoche: How Teacher Education Focus on White Privilege Undermines Anti Racism.”
Privilege Theory Is the Wrong Track
The McIntosh in question is Peggy McIntosh, whose 1988 essay “Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack” formed the foundation of privilege theory. The essay is mostly a list of ways in which white people receive better treatment in society. The MCWC describes McIntosh’s theory as a synecdoche because it has come to define the totality of education’s anti-racism efforts. It is meant to be the magic pill that clarifies things and sets us on the right course once consumed.
Many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.
They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. One case study involved an education student named John, from a small, non-diverse town. In his final essay for the class John explained his reaction to McIntosh: “I got the feeling from it that it was more about trying to make white males feel guilty for things they most likely had no control over. Being a white male I got a little worked up about the whole list since I don’t feel like I have anything to apologize for.”
John rolled his eyes at privilege theory. However, his teacher reported that other ways of exploring racism and multiculturalism such as films on race relations and historical texts broadened John’s empathy towards non-white people. John was able to reject confession while still becoming a better anti-racist educator. This made John’s teacher wonder whether confessional white privilege is the universally beneficial educational tool it is made out to be. The collective found that it is not.
In its blunt conclusion, the collective writes: “McIntosh’s conception of white privilege has been at the center of anti-racist thought and action in teacher education. We argue, however, that McIntosh’s ideas simplify white racial identity in dangerous ways. We also demonstrate that white privilege pedagogy demands confession, but that confession is a dead end. Finally, we propose that white supremacy needs to replace white privilege as the central concern of our anti-racist efforts.”
Abetting White Supremacy
When privilege theory took root in the 1990s, society roundly condemned the outward expression of racist attitudes. This is why the focus shifted to the ways in which white people were racist without even knowing it. Importantly, all white people were guilty of this form of racism. The act of confessing privilege became the means through which white people discovered this hidden racism.
The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
But, as the past year has shown us, good old-fashioned white supremacy was not gone; it was simply driven underground. Not only was white supremacy still extant, it was going more or less unaddressed. The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
One can teach against white supremacy by encouraging students to treat everyone as equal, or at least as individuals not defined in important ways by their race. Privilege theory does not allow for this approach. It demands that differences be front and center and that we always consider a person’s race in considering him. This focus on “valuing differences” over “the colorblind model” unlocked the door to the white supremacist revival that today’s anti-white rhetoric has kicked open.
White Grievance On the Rise
It surprises many people that an increasing number of white Americans over the past decade believe whites face more discrimination than blacks. Obviously this feeling is inconsistent with economic data. Many have argued that a white fear of losing the dominant economic place in society is behind this belief. But what if the discrimination that white people are feeling and expressing is not primarily economic in nature?
He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way.
This brings us back to John. What got him “worked up” about privilege theory was not that he’d have to compete for jobs with minorities. He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way. Moreover, many resent the pedagogical transformations that their history and culture are undergoing. White historical figures once held in too high esteem have swung the other way into utter disrepute. Also, the histories of no other peoples are being held to these lofty standards.
Mohandas Gandhi’s racism, the Black Panthers’ vicious murders, and Santa Anna’s barbarism are understood within the context of their positive contributions. Increasingly, white Americans perceive that Columbus, Jefferson, Jackson, and many other core white historical figures are consistently brought down a peg in order to decentralize whiteness in history. This assault on their history has a deeper impact than many on the Left are aware of, or willing to admit.
Rise of the White Race Baiters
The combination of the confessional and universal aspects of white privilege and the reconstruction of white history has opened the door for white racial grievance-mongers. From 2014 to 2015, the number of active Klu Klux Klan chapters in the United States grew from 72 to 190, a massive increase for a group so closely associated with hatred. Along with these organized efforts, social media has given a dangerous new platform to white supremacists.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers, specifically on college campuses. Conservative media seize upon disputes over the cultural appropriation of taco night or banning hoopskirts as evidence that minority racial grievance has gotten unhinged.
In emerging white nationalist journals such as Radix, this constant drumbeat of attack against white insensitivity is viewed gravely. What results is a belief among a growing number of whites in the concepts of “white genocide” and “racial realism.”
Both “white genocide” and “racial realism” harken back to the worst elements of American racial history. The former reacts in horror to the races mixing sexually for fear of resulting offspring being impure. The latter pretends to take a cold, scientific look at demography to prove the superiority of the white race. Ideas of this ilk, until recently thought to be confined to a fringe dustbin, have taken on new life in our hyper-racialized society.
Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. They are very aware of the dichotomy between non-white culture, which must be valued at all times (even in the midst of terror attacks), and white culture, which must be criticized and devalued. They don’t like it.
Same Tactics, Different Sides
The result of these societal double standards is for many a desire to lash out against it. For every white college student who dutifully accepts his privilege, many more resent the idea and wish to fight it. The sharpest arrow in their quiver is to be offensive.
In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
This desire to be offensive has given rise to the “alt right.” Supporters of this loosely assembled white nationalist movement understand a playful aspect to its use of slurs. But just as the Left shifted from using anti-white rhetoric as an ironic device to an actual indictment of white culture, so has the alt right come to believe much of its troubling rhetoric.
Do the alt right Twitter trolls really want Jews turned into lampshades, or believe blacks are apes? Many of their supporters say no, that such rhetoric is simply meant to shock the system. They feel oppressed by political correctness and they challenge it, in over-the-top, offensive ways.
If this seems familiar, it should. It is exactly the same approach taken by social justice warriors and purveyors of anti-white rhetoric. The shocking “White Men Are Bad” hot takes serve the same purpose. They are also meant to shock the system. Just as the alt right is willing to denigrate minorities to make plain what they view as racist speech codes, the Left is willing to denigrate straight, white men to make plain what they view as widespread systemic racism.
For both groups the central theme is identity. That theme quickly calcifies into attitudes too brittle to hold up serious discourse. In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
Let’s Find Another Way Forward
W.E.B. Du Bois was born just three years after the end of slavery, but was bullish on the prospects of equality, he writes in “The Souls of Black Folks.”
Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic…
Modern progressives don’t talk about the “greater ideals of the American Republic.” Rather, those ideals have become suspect, empty words used to justify slavery and genocide. But for Du Bois, who was closer to slavery than any of us will ever be, this was not the case. The facile notion that some inherent evil of whiteness must be expunged is anathema to his entire vision of equality and reconciliation.
Put simply, our anti-racism efforts must be refocused away from guilt and confession and towards equality and eradicating irrational judgments based on race. Some on the Left will object, saying that racism is so systemic in society it must be purged before anyone can pretend to treat of others without taking race into account. Some on the Right will object, saying that everything from IQ tests to crime statistics prove something meaningful about the capabilities of individuals based on their race.
Both of these perspectives must be rejected. In their place, we must return to the goal of treating people as individuals, not as representatives of their race.","['tribalism', 'resentment']"
Never mind the fact that some of Trump’s strongest supporters have had no problem whatsoever in criticizing him for substantive reasons — as in the backlash against his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Indeed, NeverTrump joined the media and Democrats in hyping the Russia conspiracy theory, and continues to mock those who dare to support the president.
The self-flattering conceit that sustains NeverTrump’s criticism is that Trump supporters are participating in a cult of personality. Never mind the fact that some of Trump’s strongest supporters have had no problem whatsoever in criticizing him for substantive reasons — as in the backlash against his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. NeverTrumpers still believe themselves to be the unique guardians of conservative orthodoxy and honest punditry.
They find a welcome audience in the mainstream media, which has always been willing to give a platform to those conservatives willing to bash other conservatives. (They deny that this is the game they are playing, because they maintain that Trump is not a real conservative, though he has governed as the most conservative president since Ronald Reagan.) They say they praise Trump when he deserves it — though they clearly savor the criticism more.
During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge. NeverTrumpers imagined they would be the last conservatives standing atop the rubble of the movement, able to set the agenda and the boundaries. After the election, most ignored calls for reconciliation.
Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.
The path ahead is a conservative primary challenge to Trump in 2020, and the foundations are being laid now.
For such a challenge to be successful, NeverTrump would have to coalesce around only one candidate — and not to persist, as it did throughout the 2016 primary, with a divided field of contenders. Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters.
The case NeverTrump and its candidate will have to make is that while they are grateful (ahem) for Trump’s success in defeating Hillary Clinton, most of his other achievements for the cause could have been done by any Republican president, and few other Republicans would come with Trump’s disadvantages. They have to hope that Democrats continue to flounder, so that a primary challenge would not seem a threat to the GOP’s 2020 prospects as a whole.
The biggest problem for NeverTrump, however, is the pitiful performance of the Republican Congress, which has been unable to act on its core priorities, and reinforces the notion that only Trump is strong enough to lead the party.
Nevertheless, NeverTrump sees in the 2020 race a reason to persist. It will continue to cast its fight as a principled one. Much of it, however, is about power and revenge. Apparently, NeverTrump cannot forgive Trump for winning.

The intersectionality-obsessed media claims Buttigieg doesn't have enough diversity points to run for president.,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/24/lgtb-people-rage-pete-buttigieg-not-gay-enough/#.XOfepli3z2A.twitter,federalist,gender,right,82.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The intersectionality-obsessed media claims Buttigieg doesn't have enough diversity points to run for president. It's just another proof that when the left gets what they said they want, they move the goalposts.
Gay representation has certainly come a long way from Patrick Stewart and Steven Weber in the classic 1995 gay film, “Jeffrey.” That same year, Patrick Swayze, John Leguizamo, and Wesley Snipes shocked audiences with their hilarious and stunningly relatable performances as urban drag queens taking a long road trip across middle America in “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar.”
And of course, who could forget Robin William’s heartfelt comedy performance in “The Birdcage”the following year? These movies were promises of societal acceptance as big-name, straight actors played proud gay characters for straight audiences who laughed, cheered, and empathized with them.
As acceptance and normalcy have rained out the gay pride parade and “coming out” no longer requires a party or the prospect of never speaking to one’s parents again, the appreciation for sharing LGBT culture has significantly dwindled. Where we once tearfully cheered on our straight allies, today we see LGBT writers and actors smugly lecturing them on the appropriate distance to keep between themselves and sacred artifacts of LGBT culture and identity.
If a straight actor plays a gay role today, the movie is likely to be boycotted by LGBT activists. If a gay actor plays a transgender role, the same can happen. Although we were once thrilled by mainstream representation, we now find LGBT people complaining that even the first openly gay candidate running for president just isn’t queer or diverse enough.
‘Heterosexuality Without Women’
In an essay featured in the Los Angeles Review of Books, writer Greta LaFleur provided the perfect illustration of where leftist identity evolution has brought the movement. The essay is titled, “Heterosexuality Without Women.” Analyzing the portrait of Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg and his husband standing in front of their home on the cover of Time, LaFleur laments, “This photo also tells a profound story about whiteness, above and beyond the fact that almost everything in this photo is, itself, white.”
While lingering on in the deeply confusing world of race-obsessed power theories so popular on the intersectional left—and struggling to precisely explain why she feels such an overwhelming discomfort with the Time magazine image—she finally comes to the conclusion, “The argument I am making, of course, is that this photo is about a lot of things, but one of its defining features is its heterosexuality. It’s offering us the promise that our first gay first family might actually be a straight one.” She even goes so far as to point out that the word “family” in the title of the headline is in bold, white letters.
The second aspect of her discomfort is represented by the idea that the “First Family” is appealing to the LGBT community in contrast to the reality that 1980s and ’90s conservatism was so greatly focused on protecting the family from gay culture. She writes, “The tulips; the Chinos; the notably charming but insistently generic porch; the awkwardly minimal touching that invokes the most uncomfortable, unfamiliar, culturally-heterosexual embrace any of us have ever received—offers a vision of heterosexuality without straight people.” Somehow a happily married gay couple is just a bit too comfortable for her.
The Daily Beast also noted this mindset is growing within the queer female community, beginning a recent piece with the premature conclusion, “But for some queer women, the primary star is just another white man running for president.” Ara Wilson, a professor at Duke University, bluntly told The Beast that her priority in electing the president did not include a young, white, gay man. She argued, “Simply put, living as a queer woman, a queer woman of color, or even a queer man of color, is markedly different than living as an educated, cisgender, well-dressed, white gay man.”
In a long tweet thread analyzing the situation, Steven W. Thrasher, a doctorate candidate at New York University, lamented that the word “gay” represents cisgender white homosexual men, while “queer” means everyone else. He began his argument, “Prediction regarding Peter Buttigieg: this candidacy will expose the major faultiness between white gay men and the rest of the LGBTQ community.”
Not Enough Intersectionality for Queer People?
His main contention revolves around his perception that only white gay men seem excited for Buttigieg, while the remaining members of the LGBT community show little support—many are even hostile to what he represents. There is a strong dislike for his race, his Christianity, his military service, and the fact that he is in a monogamous marriage, all things the writer associates with a “white, gay man.”
Despite Buttigieg acknowledging his lack of intersectional qualifications by saying, “I have no idea what it is like personally, what it is like to be a transgender woman of color, but I know that I need to stand up for her, just as others have stood up for me,” it seems inadequate to quell the criticism. Another queer lesbian woman remarked, “I do like that he’s an openly gay man running for president. But at the same time, I’m a black queer woman and sometimes it just gets a bit discouraging that the first person to open the way always has to be white.”
Christina Cauterucci, a writer at Slate, contends that because Buttigieg looks straight, is well-dressed, well-spoken, and has no overt flamboyance, he is unable to empathize with the hurdles other LGBT community members have to face. Jacob Bacharach of The Outline went a step further and demanded that Buttigieg is actually bad for the LGBT community.
Complaining, once again, that Buttigieg is white, educated, and boring, his main argument posits Buttigieg is far too conservative to adequately represent LGBT Americans. Aside from the common list of minority statuses Buttigieg lacks, Bacharach recoils at the idea of what Buttigieg and his husband portray to America—a clean, sexually monogamous, polite, financially secure, heteronormative stereotype. He seems uneasy that Buttigieg is not actively on the gay hook-up app Grindr, which he finds suspicious and offputting.
The Narrow Confines of Identity Politics
Long past are the days of “We are just like everyone else” and “We just want to be treated equally!” Today, it seems, the only thing that matters is what makes you different from everyone else. Unfortunately, identity politics defines this exclusively through skin color, gender identity, and class. Where the rainbow flag once represented the endless diversity of personal expression, with the explicit understanding that everyone in society is welcome, today it seems every individual is assigned a stripe and must never venture too far outside of its restrictions.
It is profoundly odd to me that, as a gay teenager in the late ’90s, my ideal social dream was exactly what Buttigieg represents to America today. But it seems it took us too long to grow up and the next generation has a new dream of their own, of which they do not seem as sure as we were. But they are very adamant about what they do not want.
What is progressive today will be unacceptably conservative tomorrow. Intersectional identity politics moves faster than society can keep up with. It is remarkably sad that we live in a time when a genuinely accomplished young politician can run for president and be popular based on his character, experience, and policy positions, while also being a gay married man. The left is too obsessed with his superficial characteristics to appreciate how wonderful this truly is.
We have become so normal as to be boring to young activists eager to wave their fists in the air for some revolutionary idea or another. And the end result of the long fight for gay rights and normalcy in America is the potential of the first openly gay married president in American history being dismissed for not being diverse enough for the current LGBT set.","['intersectionality-obsessed', 'diversity']"
"The open letter — Millionaires Against Pitchforks — has been released to coincide with the orgy of virtue-signalling by the globalist elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/01/23/simon-pegg-tax-the-rich-to-save-the-world/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,middle-class,right,83.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Mission Impossible star Simon Pegg has signed an open letter demanding that multi-millionaires like himself should pay more tax.
The open letter — Millionaires Against Pitchforks — has been released to coincide with the orgy of virtue-signalling by the globalist elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
According to the letter both the climate and democracy are at stake:
It is time for us to act. Despite vocal protests to the contrary, most reasonable people understand that philanthropy has always been, and always will be, an inadequate substitute for government investment. Taxes are the best and only appropriate way to ensure adequate investment in the things our societies need. Individuals who reject this truth pose a dual threat both to the climate and to democracy itself, as those seeking to avoid their tax responsibilities are often the same ones manipulating governments and democratic processes around the world for their own gain.
Explaining his decision to sign, Simon Pegg writes in the Times (of London):
“Inequality is not inevitable, it’s a policy choice. It’s the product of governments passing policies that favour the very wealthy at the expense of the less fortunate. New estimates show that almost half of the world’s population is trying to survive on $5.50 a day or less, and that the rate of poverty reduction has halved since 2013. In the last decade the number of billionaires has doubled.”
Pegg’s article is certainly an invaluable reminder of why thespians are much better at speaking lines written for them by clever people than they are at pronouncing intelligently on global fiscal policy.
Few would deny that Pegg — who made a name for himself in the charming 90s series Spaced, before launching his film career with cult classic movies such as Shaun of the Dead — is a fine and amusing comedy actor. Nobody begrudges the way he lucked out so massively by landing the role of Tom Cruise’s geeky tech whizz in the Mission Impossible movies and broke into the Hollywood big time.
What people might well wonder, though, is what on earth he thinks he’s doing putting his name to such economically illiterate tosh as this fatuous, bleeding heart screed of borderline communist drivel.
Pegg concludes:
“Our fractured world is repairable, we can build a more equal society where the richest contribute their fair share. Our politicians must govern in the interests of all, not just those with the deepest pockets.”
But the richest do already contribute their fair share, as UK political interviewer Andrew Neil bluntly pointed to Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry only this week on his BBC TV show.
Like many on the left, Thornberry — aka Baroness Nugee — sees taxing the rich as the solution to everything and attempted to claim that the “well-off” are paying less tax now than 10 years ago.
In the UK, though, this is objectively untrue.
As Neil pointed out, in the last year of the Labour government, in 2010, the richest 5 percent of taxpayers provided 45 percent of total government revenue. Now the richest 5 percent of taxpayers provide 50 percent of total government revenue in the UK.
This is a simple function of the Laffer Curve — a phenomenon clearly unknown to actors like Simon Pegg, which is surprising because it does get a mention in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.
Reducing the upper tax rate can often, counterintuitively, increase total government tax revenue — because the rich, instead of engaging in complicated (but legal) tax avoidance schemes, are happy to pay what they consider a fair rate.
If Pegg and his fellow signatories — including the inevitable Richard Curtis, director of some of the world’s most nauseating rom-coms — got their way, then, far from easing the burden of the poor it would make their lives harder. The wealthy are quite reasonably reluctant to give away more of their money than they have to and would simply move to more tax friendly jurisdictions, thus meaning the governments in high tax jurisdictions would have less to spend on worthy projects.","['orgy', 'virtue-signalling', 'globalist', 'elite']"
"Populist eruptions and governments from Brexit to Budapest to President Trump are perceived as confirmation of their fears, necessitating increasingly ferocious efforts to defend liberal democratic pluralism and its virtues of openness, tolerance, and inclusivity.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/08/nationalism-populism-and-saving-ourselves-from-a-dark-future/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,83.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"First Things editor R.R. Reno's book, 'Return of the Strong Gods,' persuasively argues that tolerance and liberalism are now at odds with our community bonds and spiritual convictions.
A specter is haunting the West; our elites see intolerant authoritarianism—along with a plethora of related “-phobias” and “-isms”—everywhere. Populist eruptions and governments from Brexit to Budapest to President Trump are perceived as confirmation of their fears, necessitating increasingly ferocious efforts to defend liberal democratic pluralism and its virtues of openness, tolerance, and inclusivity.
In his new book, Return of the Strong Gods: Nationalism, Populism, and the Future of the West, First Things editor R.R. Reno argues that these fears are mistaken. Rather than protecting us from intolerance and fascism, they are casting out the human loves that sustain cultures and nations against such darkness.
Unlike many writers sympathetic to nationalism and populism, Reno does not direct the blame for our present discontents upon anything so broad as liberalism, modernity, or the Reformation, or anyone so specific as John Locke or William of Ockham.
Rather, he addresses the postwar consensus that blamed the horrors of two World Wars on the “strong gods” that inspire strong loves and strong truth claims. The strong gods are not “golden idols or characters in ancient mythologies…They are whatever has the power to inspire love.” In public life, they are “the objects of our shared loves,” including not only the nation but also its symbols and heroes. And they have been banished as disturbers of the peace.
‘Negative Piety’
Reno presents the philosopher Karl Popper, author of The Open Society and Its Enemies, as a preeminent apostle of this “negative piety.” Popper argued that the Western philosophical tradition inaugurated by Plato was oppressive because it sought to know the truth, and “insofar as truth is known, it must be affirmed, which is to say obeyed. Therein lies the danger…Popper sees any form of transcendence as implicitly totalitarian.” In this analysis, we would be better off without capital-T Truth, for it divides us; it does not bring peace, but a sword.
Therefore, the postwar imperative of “never again!” necessitated disenchantment, openness, and weakness to dissolve the “strong beliefs and powerful loyalties thought to have fueled the conflicts that convulsed the twentieth century.” For instance, the project of the European Union is not just of easier trade and travel, but a deliberate dissolution of national identity and loyalty.
Reno demonstrates the development and eventual dominance of this viewpoint by examining a variety of figures, including George H. W. Bush, Friedrich Hayek, Albert Camus, and Jacques Derrida. Each contributed to the consensus against the strong gods and the trend, only accelerated by the end of the Cold War, toward greater openness: open minds, open economies, open borders, and open marriages.
Reno does overlook John Lennon, whose “Imagine” might be the purest popular expression of this: “Imagine there’s no countries/It isn’t hard to do/Nothing to kill or die for/And no religion, too.” A peaceful “brotherhood of man” will be achieved by weakening and dissolving strong loves and loyalties, when there are no differences worth killing or dying for.
Reservations about this program have withered among Western elites. Reno notes that “the center-left reconciled itself to openness in the economy, the center-right made its peace with ever-greater cultural openness.” The letters LGBT are now brought to you by Wall Street.
Of course, the demands of tolerance are not universal. The strong gods are still suppressed and exiled, and the heretic-hunting inquisitors of diversity have become more paranoid and vindictive in triumph. Pronouns are policed, nonconformist bakers are punished, and from the campus to HR, the bureaucracy of tolerance is a hybrid of the Kafkaesque and the Orwellian. New forms of intolerance and oppression are constantly discovered, and the exquisite sensibilities of the “woke” are able to detect racism, sexism, and so on down to 1 part per million.
Becoming Homeless
Advocates of the postwar consensus point to populist outbreaks as evidence that these repressive measures are necessary to protect the open society from its enemies. But the current populisms in the West are responses to the excess and failures of the postwar consensus, not to its absence. The immediate danger is not that of dark, strong gods, but of a vacuum. Our problems are not those of a closed society, but of one that is too open. We are not suffering from too much solidarity and loyalty, but dissolution.
This is exemplified by a leadership class that is disloyal to those it seeks to lead. On issues of economics and immigration, the rhetoric of openness has gone hand in hand with the ruthless exploitation of cheap labor and the disavowal of economic solidarity with fellow citizens. As Reno notes, “Our center-left leadership class will promise to subsidize working-class consumption, but it won’t reorient the global economy toward their employment.” Welfare, yes; jobs, no—just give the proles some cash so they can distract themselves with cheap consumer goods made in China. The costs of working-class decline are just one more thing for corporations to outsource.
Populist claims that the system is rigged resonate because there is truth in them. Elites are insulated from the worst effects of the cultural and economic dissolution they support. Reno observes that, “For all their talk of an open economy and open society, those in the upper echelons of our society work very hard to protect their children.” Everyone wants a secure future for their children, even if it requires ideological hypocrisy—just look at well-off white liberal parents in New York City and the schools they send their children to.
A broader sense of solidarity no longer informs our culture and economy. We are becoming homeless; a place to live is not the same as a place to belong, and the postwar consensus has deconstructed the sources of belonging. We were told that diversity and inclusion would provide “a home without walls” in which everyone felt welcomed and accepted, but this has not come to pass. Those subjected to these therapies of the open society still seek loyalty and solidarity, which often leads to nurturing grievances and embracing identity politics.
The postwar consensus is in crisis because it is unbalanced; the more dominant it becomes, the more destabilizing its neglect of basic human needs for belonging and solidarity becomes. Reno therefore declares that “We don’t need more diversity and innovation. We need a home. And for that, we will require the return of the strong gods.” The peace and prosperity the postwar consensus promised (and to some degree delivered) is not enough, for humans are not livestock.
The Anti-Human Consensus
We are not fulfilled by a boundless world of autonomous individuality and weak loves. We long to love and be loved. We long for a “we” to belong to and share our love with. In Reno’s words:
We desire to live shoulder to shoulder with our fellow man in the service of shared loves. So no, we are not safer with never-ending critique, the spontaneous order of the free market, technocratic management of utilities, and the other therapies of weakening. Disenchantment will not make our society more humane. When the open society becomes an enemy of shared loves, when critical intelligence wages total war against our anchoring convictions, our spiritual, cultural, and political consensus becomes anti-human.
Discontent is the inevitable result of a political and cultural consensus that is, “at root, fearful of love.” Men may do terrible things for strong loves and loyalties. The strong gods may demand dreadful sacrifices. But “the project of peace without love cannot go on much longer. Man was not created to be alone…We yearn to join ourselves to others, not only in the bond of matrimony, but in civic and religious bonds as well.” Thus, it is not a question of whether the strong gods will return, but what they will be.
The strong gods are coming back. They cannot be wished or sneered or critiqued away. Denouncing tribalism and complaining about ingratitude (as many advocates of the current consensus do) will not keep populism and other passions at bay. Limiting and restraining the dark potential of the strong gods of politics requires the stronger gods of family and faith.
G.K. Chesterton’s observation regarding the Roman Republic remains relevant, for “only men to whom the family is sacred will ever have a standard or status by which to criticize the state. They alone can appeal to something more holy than the gods of the city; the gods of the hearth.” We may also appeal to a God above the gods of the city. A man’s love for God above him, and for his family around him, provide strength that can defy the demands of the state.
As Reno puts it, “The perverse gods of blood, soil, and identity cannot be overcome with the open society therapies of weakening.” They can only be defeated by strong gods that ennoble and elevate. Therefore, he concludes that our task “is to restore public life in the West by developing a language of love and a vision of the ‘we’ that befits our dignity and appeals to our reason as well as to our hearts.”
Reno ends with this call to action, but he has not provided a definitive treatise. Rather, this slim volume is a self-conscious conscious reframing that surveys subjects from statesmen, theologians, and philosophers to architects, authors, and economists. Readers may quibble with parts of it (I would place much more emphasis on the continuity between liberal ideology and the postwar consensus), but the broad argument is persuasive and timely.
This book provides a disenchantment and deconstruction of the postwar consensus itself, revealing that it is not an eternal verity or the sole legitimate basis for culture and government, but a contingent response to the catastrophes of the last century. As such it was understandable, but mistaken. The goal of preventing fanaticism and authoritarianism was laudable, but the method of draining away particularity and its loyalties was not.
Endless openness is making us lonely, homeless, and anxious amidst our material plenitude, and has enervated the elevating loves that alone can resist the strong, dark gods of this world. The strong gods are returning. We will choose whom we serve by who and what we love.",['ferocious']

Gavin Newsom unearthed an unprecedented new health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering dramatically more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting the embattled Affordable Care Act, which a federal judge recently struck down as unconstitutional.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-sweeping-new-california-health-care-plan-illegal-immigrants-obamacare?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20foxnews%2Fpolitics%20%28Internal%20-%20Politics%20-%20Text%29,fox-news,middle-class,right,83.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Shortly after he took office on Monday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unearthed an unprecedented new health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering dramatically more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting the embattled Affordable Care Act, which a federal judge recently struck down as unconstitutional.
The sweeping proposal appeared destined to push California -- already one of the nation's most liberal states -- even further to the left, as progressive Democrats there won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in November and control all statewide offices.
""People's lives, freedom, security, the water we drink, the air we breathe — they all hang in the balance,"" Newsom, 51, told supporters Monday in a tent outside the state Capitol building, as he discussed his plans to address issues from homelessness to criminal justice and the environment. ""The country is watching us, the world is watching us. The future depends on us, and we will seize this moment.""
Newsom unveiled his new health-care plan hours after a protester interrupted his swearing-in ceremony to protest the murder of police Cpl. Ronil Singh shortly after Christmas Day. The suspect in Singh's killing is an illegal immigrant with several prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that so-called ""sanctuary state"" policies, like the ones Newsom has championed, contributed to the murder by prohibiting state police from cooperating with federal immigration officials.
As one of his first orders of business, Newsom -- who also on Monday requested that the Trump administration cooperate in the state's efforts to convert to a single-payer system, even as he bashed the White House as corrupt and immoral -- declared his intent to reinstate the ObamaCare individual mandate at the state level.
ANALYSIS: AS CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESSIVE POLICIES GET CRAZIER, WHAT'S THE SILVER LINING FOR THE GOP?
The mandate forces individuals to purchase health care coverage or pay a fee that the Supreme Court described in 2012 as a ""tax,"" rather than a ""penalty"" that would have run afoul of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Last month, though, a federal judge in Texas ruled the individual mandate no longer was a constitutional exercise of Congress' taxing power because Republicans had passed legislation eliminating the tax entirely -- a move, the judge said, that rendered the entire health-care law unworkable.
As that ruling works its way to what analysts say will be an inevitable Supreme Court showdown, Newsom said he would reimpose it in order to subsidize state health care.
Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, according to Newsom's new agenda. The previous age cutoff was 19, as The Sacramento Bee reported.
Additionally, Newsom announced he would sign an executive order dramatically expanding the state's Department of Health Care Services authority to negotiate drug prices, in the hopes of lowering prescription drug costs.
In his inaugural remarks, Newsom hinted that he intended to abandon the relative fiscal restraint that marked the most recent tenure of his predecessor, Jerry Brown, from 2011 to 2019. Brown sometimes rebuked progressive efforts to spend big on various social programs.
""For eight years, California has built a foundation of rock,"" Newsom said. ""Our job now is not to rest on that foundation. It is to build our house upon it.""
Newsom added that California will not have ""one house for the rich and one for the poor, or one for the native-born and one for the rest.""
""The country is watching us, the world is watching us."" — California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom
In a statement, the California Immigrant Policy Center backed Newsom's agenda.
“Making sure healthcare is affordable and accessible for every Californian, including undocumented community members whom the federal government has unjustly shut out of care, is essential to reaching that vision for our future,” the organization said. “Today’s announcement is an historic step on the road toward health justice for all.”

The Sacramento Bee reported on several of Newsom's recent hires, which seemingly signaled he's serious about his push to bring universal health care to California. Chief of Staff Ann O’Leary worked in former President Bill Clinton's administration on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which offers affordable health care to children in families who exceed the financial threshold to qualify for Medicaid, but who are too poor to buy private insurance.
And, Cabinet Secretary Ana Matosantos, who worked in the administrations of Brown and former GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, has worked extensively to implement ObamaCare in California and also worked with the legislature to expand health-care coverage for low-income Californians.

Joni Ernst (R-IA) told Breitbart News during a press conference on Wednesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wants carveouts for millionaires to “shore up” support for Democrats.
Ernst, one of the Senate’s leading government waste hawks, unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would end a carveout for millionaires to obtain a taxpayer-funded unemployment benefit during the coronavirus outbreak.
Ernst’s bill, the Returning Inappropriate Cash Handouts (RICH) Act, would block Americans who lost their job but are still earning $1 million or more this year from receiving the $600 weekly unemployment bonus for the newly expanded unemployment coverage under the CARES Act. Ernst’s office noted that the legislation could save the bill as much as $2 million every week.
Ernst said during the press conference that millionaires continue to benefit while essential workers put their lives at risk.
“Folks, think about it. We have essential workers, many of them working long hours on the frontlines of the pandemic and putting their lives at risk, having their tax dollars taken out of their wallets and put into the pockets of millionaires who aren’t working,” Ernst said. “The question of the day: isn’t that just rich?”
“With our nation facing a record-breaking budget deficit of 4 trillion dollars, we cannot afford to be subsidizing the lifestyles of coastal elite millionaires,” she added.
Breitbart News asked Ernst why she thought Pelosi would create this carveout for millionaires. Pelosi also eliminated the limitations on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which Republicans lowered through the Trump Tax and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction primarily benefits wealthy, mostly Democrat, and coastal states such as New York, New Jersey, and California.
Ernst said that these carveouts primarily benefit the Democrat donor class.
She told Breitbart News, “I mean, where is Nancy Pelosi from? She is one of those wealthy, coastal elites. To shore up their support for Democrats certainly, they want to include these carveouts, and allowing millionaires to take the extra $600 a week that is coming from people, from hardworking Americans and Iowans, is absolutely ludicrous. That’s not something that they paid into through payroll taxes; it’s just government funds that are going to these out-of-work millionaires.”
“They also did do away with the SALT provision that has been enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which gives those coastal elites greater advantage as well,” Ernst added. “So you would have to ask Nancy Pelosi why she and the other Democrats are providing these special breaks for wealthy millionaires when they claim to be for the hardworking middle class.”","['hawks', 'carveout', 'waste']"
"In truth, these examples are caricatures of Epicureanism. Epicureanism is not hedonism; rather, it abhors lack of restraint and shameless debauchery. After all, these things bring more pain than pleasure.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/01/coronavirus-friendship-collapse-shows-why-we-need-christian-epicureanism/,federalist,coronavirus,right,83.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"What does Christian Epicureanism afford the modern Christian living through a pandemic? It offers the very things necessary to recover: friendship and peace.
Even as various states reopen, the panic and concern over COVID-19 remain high. People worry about new outbreaks occurring, as some experts predict, while others stay home afraid despite loosening restrictions.
Others worry about harm done already by the shutdowns. Many businesses have closed permanently, and a record number of people are unemployed. Additionally, many hospitals have halted nonemergency procedures, and untold numbers of people with non-COVID ailments must forego treatment.
In such a time, it is ideal to adopt the Stoic philosophy to successfully cope with the tribulations and keep one’s sanity. As Michael Warren Davis argues in a recent essay, “More than Christian virologists or economists or social workers, we need Christian Stoics.” Instead of giving way to despair, Christians should master themselves, strive for virtue, and suffer with dignity. The virus and shutdowns, grave as they are, will pass, but everyone can learn from them and be more than members of the passive herd beholden to external forces.
By contrast, very few Christians or conservatives would recommend Epicureanism, the rivaling philosophy to Stoicism. With its supposed emphasis on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, Epicureanism seems poorly suited to meet the challenges of the Wuhan virus. In most people’s minds, today’s Epicureans are the careless young people flocking to the beach to enjoy a prolonged spring break, or else they are the lazy couch potatoes, relishing their unemployment checks and happily taking in the popular idea that their binge-watching is saving lives.
In truth, these examples are caricatures of Epicureanism. Epicureanism is not hedonism; rather, it abhors lack of restraint and shameless debauchery. After all, these things bring more pain than pleasure.
What is True Epicureanism?
The true Epicurean leads an ascetic life, one of material detachment and personal self-sufficiency. He resembles more the Buddhist monk who saw life as suffering than the heedless Romantic chasing moments of sensual ecstasy. Even as he criticizes Epicureanism on the whole, Roger Kimball concedes, “Epicureanism is a deeply ascetic philosophy. It preaches the gospel of pleasure. But it defines pleasure in such a way that no hedonist worth his salt would embrace it.”
Where Kimball and many others find fault is in the shallow materialist mindset of Epicureanism. The Epicurean had to convince himself that death was a return to nothingness. His soul and body would eventually dissolve, and no god would take much notice of it.
To be fair, the Epicurean account of death matches the Stoic’s account. While the Stoic may not have gone so far as to conclude that all life is mere matter, he did think of death as a kind of nothingness. Pondering death, the Roman Stoic Seneca blithely remarked in a letter, “Death is just not being. … It will be the same after me as before me.” To correct this mistake in both philosophies requires the light of Christian revelation, which promises a heavenly reward that awaits those who follow God’s commands, not a return to nonexistence.
People Need Friendship
All this said, what does Epicureanism, or Christian Epicureanism, afford the modern Christian living through a pandemic? It offers the very things necessary to recover: friendship and peace.
Dr. John Rist writes in the journal “Classical Philology” that all men “desire the peace and blessedness of the gods; and, for Epicurus, the most efficacious means of attaining that goal is available through friendship.” While Epicureans handled the pains of life, particularly the natural fears of death, through “right doctrine,” they also sought out companions with whom to share their pleasures and alleviate hardship.
At a time when organizations and governments call on their people to socially distance and wear masks, the willingness to trust others and cultivate friendship is lower than usual. Even some Christians have come to regard their fellow believers more as potential carriers of the virus than companions seeking common goodness and truth. Once churches reopen, it will be difficult to abandon this view.
To make matters worse, even before the pandemic, many Christian communities suffered from the lack of association between members. In the last few decades, many people have come to see church as a distributor of the sacraments and a source of wholesome uncontroversial teachings, neglecting to see it as a space to form strong friendships within the context of spiritual life. As such, many churches are not really bodies of believers anymore, but charitable organizations with generic norms and practices. While Christ told his disciples, “I call you friends,” too many Christians today do not call each other anything.
Christian Epicureanism Joins the Physical and Spiritual
An Epicurean mindset could address this problem by restoring an appreciation of the physical world. The encroachments of virtual reality along with COVID-19 countermeasures have caused most Christians to retreat ever further into their own minds and screens. Spiritual and material health, however, depend on life lived in the world outside. The Christian should interact with others, form personal bonds, and experience true pleasure from worshiping with friends.
Coupled with the Epicurean injunction to seek the pleasurable and enjoy what Epicurus himself called the “immortal good” of friendship, Christians should practice the theological virtue of hope. Kimball is right to criticize the inadequacy of Epicurean materialism to account for suffering and death: “[W]hat one resents about death is not the simple absence of sense experience but the loss of the world: one’s friends, engagements, duties, involvements, as well as the panoply of sense experience that attends living.”
If the physical world is all that exists, ignoring the absolute pain and loss that inevitably occur is impossible. A Stoic might at least see this as occasion for virtue and character-building; an Epicurean has to pretend it doesn’t affect him.
The Christian Epicurean, however, can hope in God’s mercy, which makes the crosses of life bearable. Furthermore, hope in a loving God can strengthen friendships between those who share that hope. Not only do Christians look to one another for comfort and support, they can also look to God together. Friendship and faith reinforce one another to make a believer more alive.
As this interaction of faith and friendship enlivens individuals, it also invigorates the Christian community. People certainly need the sacraments, but they also need one another. The time apart has made this more evident.
By all means, let Christian Stoics show virtue in the face of adversity, but let them do this as moderately, outwardly, and joyfully as Christian Epicureans.","['abhors', 'shameless']"

A U-turn, an angry president and a fateful walk to a churchBy ROBERT BURNSAP National Security WriterThe Associated PressWASHINGTON
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Mark Esper was three blocks from the FBI’s Washington field office. He had planned to confer there at a security command center, but plans changed with an unexpected call to divert immediately.
Go the White House. President Donald Trump wanted a briefing from him and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on how the military was handling security as protests grew on the streets of the nation’s capital.
Esper’s driver pulled a U-turn in the middle of the street and flipped on the flashing lights, and they rushed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
It was late afternoon on Monday, June 1 — one of the more consequential days of Donald Trump’s presidency, when he was forced to reckon with rapidly swelling demonstrations after George Floyd’s death in the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
This account of Trump’s decision-making, based on a senior defense official as well as several others in the Trump administration, offers insight into how the president was pushing for the fastest, most extreme measures while advisers at the Pentagon tried to persuade him to take a more moderate approach.
The officials asked that their names not be used to describe sensitive deliberations.
At an Oval Office meeting late Monday morning, tempers were flaring. Trump and some of his senior aides wanted federal troops on the streets, and fast.
Some Washington businesses had been vandalized Sunday night and St. John’s Church, near the White House, had sustained fire damage. Trump was unhappy. Some governors, and local authorities in the District of Columbia, were not doing enough to stop violence, Trump believed.
By Monday morning he was considering a dramatic move — invoking the Insurrection Act so that he could use federal troops to enforce the law.
According to a senior defense official, Trump wanted 10,000 federal troops immediately on the streets to control a situation some aides believed could escalate dangerously.
Esper and Milley, however, argued against calling out the active-duty forces, fearful that it would militarize a problem that should be handled by civilian law enforcement. Violent elements among the protest crowds, the two men believed, were too small and manageable to justify calling out the military.
Attorney General William Barr on Sunday denied Trump asked for 10,000 troops. When asked on Saturday, the White House would neither confirm nor deny the figure. On Sunday, the White House director of strategic communications, Alyssa Farah, said in a tweet that Trump directed a surge of Guardsmen, not active-duty troops.
A senior White House official recalled Trump urging Esper and Milley to get as many troops as needed to secure the city. The president stressed that Sunday night’s unrest, in which St. John’s Church sustained fire damage and some businesses were vandalized, had shown that security was inadequate.
With the president’s demands in mind, and hoping they could stall his move to use federal troops, Esper and Milley moved swiftly to try to get governors to send as many National Guard troops from their states as possible to supplement the roughly 1,300 District of Columbia National Guard members and a hodgepodge of Park Police, Secret Service and other federal law enforcement officers dealing with protesters.
Because of the District of Columbia’s special status and its dizzying mix of jurisdictions, the FBI field office had been selected to serve as a command post to coordinate the movements and functions of various security forces. Attorney General William Barr was in charge. That’s why Esper was headed there from the Pentagon on Monday afternoon when he got the call to go see Trump again.
Milley had gone to the command center, also. And figuring he had seen the last of the White House for the day, he made a decision he later regretted — changing from his dress uniform, which is standard for a White House visit, to his battle fatigues, everyday wear at the Pentagon and when mixing with troops. Milley figured he would have a long night, including time with troops on the street.
Another surprise was in store for Esper and Milley when they reached the White House. After meetings, Trump went to the Rose Garden, where he noted Americans’ revulsion at Floyd’s death and declared himself the “president of law and order.”
“In recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, antifa and others,” he said. “A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents.”
That failure, in Trump’s view, made it urgent to get more security on the streets, even if it meant using active-duty forces, about 1,300 of which had been moved to military bases just outside of Washington, just in case.
Esper and Milley, joined by Barr, opposed the use of federal troops at that point. To Esper, a failure to get more Guard troops called up would mean there would be active-duty troops all over the country confronting protesters, a scene he and Milley saw as unwise and untenable.
After Trump finished his remarks in the Rose Garden he gathered aides and officials, including Esper and Milley, for a walk across Lafayette Park to St. John’s Church. The president held up a Bible to pose for photographers.
Critics would slam both Esper and Milley for their presence at the photo op — especially with Milley in battle fatigues. The scene fed a perception that Milley was giving tangible meaning to Trump’s threat to use the military on city streets, and that Esper was allowing himself to be used to advance a political agenda.

Salvini said that he would not be attending or even watching the match which pits Juventus against AC Milan despite being an AC Milan supporter, Il Giornale reports.
“I won’t watch that match,” Salvini said and added, “Soccer is a slave to business and television.”
The match, which is set to be held on January 16th in Jeddah, has been hailed by Serie A president Gaetano Micciche as a “historic” match that could drive Saudi women to take up the sport.
Along with Salvini, several other politicians have criticised the choice of location for the match such as Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni who said, “Women can only go in the family areas, not alone, because Islam does not allow it, so an Italian woman who wanted to buy a ticket to watch the game alone or with a group of friends can not do it.”

“That is disgusting. Have we sold centuries of European civilisation and battles for the rights of women for money to the Saudis?” she added.
Others have called for the game to be moved due to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi including human rights groups such as Amnesty International.
Another football tournament is also the set to take place in the Middle East in Qatar in 2022 with the country doubling the price of alcohol in a so-called “sin tax.”
The remarks by Salvini come as the populist leader continues to forge alliances among other conservative and populist leaders across Europe including the recent announcement of a meeting between Salvini and Polish Law and Justice (PiS) party leader Jarosław Kaczyński.

Steve Mnuchin, alerting him that financial institutions might use recovery funds to target gun companies.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reports that U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) spearheaded the effort to warn Mnuchin not simply that the efforts against gun companies could occur, but are fully expected.
The letter said, “A small but vocal minority has weaponized federally-backed banks against politically-disfavored businesses that operate in good faith and compliance with the law, by denying them financial services based on political reasons that have nothing to do with creditworthiness.”
The Senators listed a number of bans, Citibank and Bank of America JP Morgan Chase among them, as examples of financial institutions that have previously put special rules or corporate gun controls in place for businesses in the firearms industry.
NSSF explained:
These banks has taken discriminatory stances against the firearms industry, denying financial services unless manufacturers and retailers adopt their views on gun control. It isn’t just the firearm industry that’s been victimized by the corporate virtue signalers. These banking institutions, along with credit card processors and financial service providers, also targeted the oil and gas industry, coal, private corrections and other politically disfavored industries.
On March 23, 2018, Breitbart News reported that Citibank had unveiled a new “Commercial Firearms Policy,” aimed at denying business to members of the firearms industry who refused to enact corporate gun controls urged by Citibank.
On April 13, 2018, Reuters reported that Bank of America was reworking their policy so as to end business with customers “who make military-style firearms for civilians.” Bank of America does not differentiate between the fact that military rifles are fully automatic, whereas civilian firearms are only semiautomatic.
The Citibank and Bank of America examples are just the tip of the iceberg, and do not even begin to reveal the larger financial shenanigans against gun makers via Operation Choke Point.

"One of the bitterest cases in academe involved Steven Salaita, whose offer of a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois was revoked in 2014 after he posted a series of tweets harshly critical of Israel.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/omar-furor-reflects-intensifying-national-debate-over-israel,fox-news,international-politics-and-world-news,right,84.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"For Congress, the allegations of anti-Semitism directed toward Rep. Ilhan Omar have no precedent. Yet on college campuses, in state legislatures and in many other venues nationwide, the polarized debate about Israel is a familiar conflict and likely to intensify in the months and years ahead.
Fueled by a wave of youthful activists, including many Jews aligning with Muslims, criticism of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians has grown in volume and scope, with persistent calls for boycotts and disinvestment. Pro-Israel organizations and politicians have countered with tough responses, and efforts to reconcile the differences have gained little traction.
Among those fearing escalation is Deborah Lipstadt, a history professor at Emory University and author of a new book, ""Antisemitism: Here and Now,"" about the recent resurgence of anti-Semitism in the United States and Europe. She calls herself an optimist, but she says it's hard to be hopeful in the current political climate.
""Leaders on the left and the right are using this phenomenon as a way of drumming up support, claiming they're victims,"" she said. ""I fear it will get far worse before it gets better.""
Congress has never experienced this kind of furor involving a Muslim member accused of anti-Semitism.
Omar, a freshman congresswoman from Minnesota, sparked turmoil within the Democratic caucus with her criticisms of Israel and suggestions that Israel's supporters wanted lawmakers to pledge ""allegiance"" to a foreign country. Divided Democrats eventually drafted a resolution that condemned a wide range of bigotry and did not mention Omar by name.
One of the first two Muslim women in Congress, Omar supports a contentious part of the overall dispute — the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, or BDS, which promotes various forms of boycotts against Israel.
Some celebrities — including actress Natalie Portman and singer Lana Del Ray — have withdrawn from appearances in Israel in recent months out of concern over Israeli policies. Several scholarly associations, including the American Studies Association and the Association for Asian American Studies, have supported an academic boycott, even as other associations and academic leaders have opposed that campaign.
One of the bitterest cases in academe involved Steven Salaita, whose offer of a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois was revoked in 2014 after he posted a series of tweets harshly critical of Israel. He sued the university and won a financial settlement, but he was unable to find a permanent academic positon elsewhere. He posted a blog piece in February mentioning his current job as a school bus driver near Washington.
In response to the BDS movement, 26 states have passed laws seeking to deter businesses and individuals from participating in it. For example, a Texas law requires contractors who work for or do business with the state to certify that they do not boycott Israel or Israeli-occupied territories.
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed lawsuits challenging the Texas law and similar laws in three other states, saying they violate the right to free speech. A separate lawsuit was filed in Texas by a speech language pathologist, Bahia Amawi, who said she lost her contract with the state because she would not sign the certification.
Among the companies entangled in the conflict is Airbnb, which announced in November that it would stop listing properties in the West Bank. Texas officials say the state will halt business with Airbnb because its move ran afoul the anti-BDS law. Airbnb says it opposes the BDS campaign and was simply implementing a policy to de-list residences in disputed territories around the world.
One of the groups supporting BDS is Jewish Voice for Peace, which was founded in 1996 and endorsed the boycott campaign in 2015. Rabbi Alissa Wise, the group's deputy director, says the boycott campaign has been effective, even in the face of state laws seeking to curtail it.
""These laws are meant to silence and repress,"" she said. ""But they can't change people's hearts and minds.""
The Anti-Defamation League, whose mission is to combat anti-Semitism, denounces Jewish Voice for Peace as ""a radical anti-Israel activist group"" that advocates a total boycott.
The ADL's CEO and national director, Jonathan Greenblatt, says not all people engaged in the BDS campaign are anti-Semitic, but he contends the movement itself ""is anti-Semitic in its origins.""
""It is not focused on resolving the conflict in the best interest of all parties,"" Greenblatt said.
For now, supporters of Israeli policy have some key advantages: Republicans in Congress are solidly in their camp, as are many Christian evangelicals, who make up a key part of President Donald Trump's political base. But there are some shifts — notably a widening split of viewpoints among Democrats.
Peter Beinart, a journalist, TV commentator and university professor, is one of the prominent American Jews who has been outspoken in criticizing Israeli policy. He says his views are shared by an ever-growing portion of younger generations in the U.S., including Jews.
""You see mobilization of young millennial Jews in quite a confrontation with their own communal Jewish establishment, which can include their own parents,"" he said.
Muqtedar Khan, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Delaware, shares Beinart's views about shifting attitudes, but he worries about the response from hardline supporters of Israel.
""For a lot of people who take pro-Palestinian positions, a lot of nasty things are going to happen to them,"" he said.
Atiya Aftab, who teaches in the Middle Eastern Studies Program at Rutgers University and chairs Rutgers' Center for Islamic Life, has worked for years to promote interfaith dialogue between Muslims and Jews.
She is encouraged by the breadth of support extended to Omar after the congresswoman was criticized, but she worries that bridge-building will become more difficult amid the polarizing ideological conflict.
""It's always lurking in the background,"" she said. ""The political situation we find ourselves in just creeps in, and I don't know the solution.""
Both Muslims and Jews have reason to be alarmed by data on hate crimes. The latest FBI report showed a sharp increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2017. FBI data also shows that anti-Muslim attacks have doubled since 2013.
""With anti-Semitism and Islamophobia on the rise, we have a lot of work to do,"" said Aziza Hasan, executive director of a Los Angeles-based Muslim-Jewish partnership called NewGround. ""Our destiny is intertwined and we should act like it.""

"Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/23/how-anti-white-rhetoric-is-fueling-white-nationalism/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,84.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea.
I opened Twitter recently and saw 20+ notifications. Most of the time that means the new generation of white nationalist Twitter trolls are filling my feed with racist and anti-Semitic cartoons. It was the trolls, but this was different. They were celebrating my use of the word “anti-white” in a tweet. They saw it as a victory that a “mainstream conservative” was using this term that for so long has been their calling card.
They had a point. Until recently I would have been unlikely to use the term. Not because I didn’t believe some people harbored animosity towards whites, but because that was a fringe attitude removed from power, which represented little real threat. That is no longer the case. Progressive rhetoric on race has turned an ugly corner and the existence of “anti-white” attitudes can no longer be ignored.
In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Loosely backed up by historical inequities and disparities in mass shootings, this position has begun to take a serious foothold.
Don’t Ask White People to Be More Tribal
Strikingly, this shift in rhetoric undermines what was once the core of anti-racist efforts. Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race. This is a classic theme in critical race theory, that people of color carry a burden of representation that white people do not. But foisting the baggage of representation onto white people doesn’t solve that problem. It makes it worse.
Treating people equally has given way to making all of us ambassadors for our race.
White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. The last thing our society needs is for white people to feel more tribal. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood.
A big part of the reason white Americans have been willing to go along with policies that are prejudicial on their face, such as affirmative action, is that they do not view themselves as a tribe. Given the inequality of resources favoring whites in our society, it is a good thing that white people view themselves as the ones without an accent. Should that change, white privilege (whatever one views that to be) will not be eviscerated—it will be entrenched.
The Tipping Point of Whiteness
All of this comes at a time when the last immigrants from the great wave of white immigration from 1850-1920 have died off. In the past, most whites identified with their European ethnicity: Irish, Italian, German, etc. As white people gravitate away from such identities, many see themselves as a neutral, “non racial” population. The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as “white,” but it is far preferable to the alternative: an American white population that views itself as a special-interest group.
The Left criticizes this refusal to see themselves as ‘white,’ but it is far preferable to the alternative.
The recurring, tired refrain that we should have a white history month if there is a black history month, or white student unions on campuses, is unintentionally being given new life by the Left. Celebrations or organizations of whiteness do not exist because we don’t need them. White people do not face the same kinds of systemic discrimination that people of color do. But progressives are doing a very good job of convincing white people that they do.
When parents of Virginia high school students complained about a white privilege video being shown to their kids, they rightfully noted that their kids were being singled out based on their race. The video featured a foot race in which people of color were burdened by impediments while the white people ran free. It was absolutely fair for them to interpret this as a message to their kids saying, “Your accomplishments are easier and less valuable than those of your peers of color.”
Many parents object to this method of teaching about race relations. While some white people, especially those in the academy and the arts, find the acceptance of privilege and its associated guilt liberating, many do not. Privilege theory is also not being offered as one of many ways to confront and consider racism; it is being offered as the central way. This was brilliantly explored in 2010 by the Midwestern Critical Whiteness Collective’s (MCWC’s) article in Harvard Education Review, “McIntosh as Synecdoche: How Teacher Education Focus on White Privilege Undermines Anti Racism.”
Privilege Theory Is the Wrong Track
The McIntosh in question is Peggy McIntosh, whose 1988 essay “Unpacking The Invisible Knapsack” formed the foundation of privilege theory. The essay is mostly a list of ways in which white people receive better treatment in society. The MCWC describes McIntosh’s theory as a synecdoche because it has come to define the totality of education’s anti-racism efforts. It is meant to be the magic pill that clarifies things and sets us on the right course once consumed.
Many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education.
They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. One case study involved an education student named John, from a small, non-diverse town. In his final essay for the class John explained his reaction to McIntosh: “I got the feeling from it that it was more about trying to make white males feel guilty for things they most likely had no control over. Being a white male I got a little worked up about the whole list since I don’t feel like I have anything to apologize for.”
John rolled his eyes at privilege theory. However, his teacher reported that other ways of exploring racism and multiculturalism such as films on race relations and historical texts broadened John’s empathy towards non-white people. John was able to reject confession while still becoming a better anti-racist educator. This made John’s teacher wonder whether confessional white privilege is the universally beneficial educational tool it is made out to be. The collective found that it is not.
In its blunt conclusion, the collective writes: “McIntosh’s conception of white privilege has been at the center of anti-racist thought and action in teacher education. We argue, however, that McIntosh’s ideas simplify white racial identity in dangerous ways. We also demonstrate that white privilege pedagogy demands confession, but that confession is a dead end. Finally, we propose that white supremacy needs to replace white privilege as the central concern of our anti-racist efforts.”
Abetting White Supremacy
When privilege theory took root in the 1990s, society roundly condemned the outward expression of racist attitudes. This is why the focus shifted to the ways in which white people were racist without even knowing it. Importantly, all white people were guilty of this form of racism. The act of confessing privilege became the means through which white people discovered this hidden racism.
The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
But, as the past year has shown us, good old-fashioned white supremacy was not gone; it was simply driven underground. Not only was white supremacy still extant, it was going more or less unaddressed. The shift to the privilege model had an unintended consequence that is abetting white supremacy.
One can teach against white supremacy by encouraging students to treat everyone as equal, or at least as individuals not defined in important ways by their race. Privilege theory does not allow for this approach. It demands that differences be front and center and that we always consider a person’s race in considering him. This focus on “valuing differences” over “the colorblind model” unlocked the door to the white supremacist revival that today’s anti-white rhetoric has kicked open.
White Grievance On the Rise
It surprises many people that an increasing number of white Americans over the past decade believe whites face more discrimination than blacks. Obviously this feeling is inconsistent with economic data. Many have argued that a white fear of losing the dominant economic place in society is behind this belief. But what if the discrimination that white people are feeling and expressing is not primarily economic in nature?
He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way.
This brings us back to John. What got him “worked up” about privilege theory was not that he’d have to compete for jobs with minorities. He was upset at having to confess guilt for events he had no control over. Many whites feel this way. Moreover, many resent the pedagogical transformations that their history and culture are undergoing. White historical figures once held in too high esteem have swung the other way into utter disrepute. Also, the histories of no other peoples are being held to these lofty standards.
Mohandas Gandhi’s racism, the Black Panthers’ vicious murders, and Santa Anna’s barbarism are understood within the context of their positive contributions. Increasingly, white Americans perceive that Columbus, Jefferson, Jackson, and many other core white historical figures are consistently brought down a peg in order to decentralize whiteness in history. This assault on their history has a deeper impact than many on the Left are aware of, or willing to admit.
Rise of the White Race Baiters
The combination of the confessional and universal aspects of white privilege and the reconstruction of white history has opened the door for white racial grievance-mongers. From 2014 to 2015, the number of active Klu Klux Klan chapters in the United States grew from 72 to 190, a massive increase for a group so closely associated with hatred. Along with these organized efforts, social media has given a dangerous new platform to white supremacists.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers.
One of the key components to the success of this racism is the almost-daily parade of silly micro-aggressions and triggers, specifically on college campuses. Conservative media seize upon disputes over the cultural appropriation of taco night or banning hoopskirts as evidence that minority racial grievance has gotten unhinged.
In emerging white nationalist journals such as Radix, this constant drumbeat of attack against white insensitivity is viewed gravely. What results is a belief among a growing number of whites in the concepts of “white genocide” and “racial realism.”
Both “white genocide” and “racial realism” harken back to the worst elements of American racial history. The former reacts in horror to the races mixing sexually for fear of resulting offspring being impure. The latter pretends to take a cold, scientific look at demography to prove the superiority of the white race. Ideas of this ilk, until recently thought to be confined to a fringe dustbin, have taken on new life in our hyper-racialized society.
Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. They are very aware of the dichotomy between non-white culture, which must be valued at all times (even in the midst of terror attacks), and white culture, which must be criticized and devalued. They don’t like it.
Same Tactics, Different Sides
The result of these societal double standards is for many a desire to lash out against it. For every white college student who dutifully accepts his privilege, many more resent the idea and wish to fight it. The sharpest arrow in their quiver is to be offensive.
In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
This desire to be offensive has given rise to the “alt right.” Supporters of this loosely assembled white nationalist movement understand a playful aspect to its use of slurs. But just as the Left shifted from using anti-white rhetoric as an ironic device to an actual indictment of white culture, so has the alt right come to believe much of its troubling rhetoric.
Do the alt right Twitter trolls really want Jews turned into lampshades, or believe blacks are apes? Many of their supporters say no, that such rhetoric is simply meant to shock the system. They feel oppressed by political correctness and they challenge it, in over-the-top, offensive ways.
If this seems familiar, it should. It is exactly the same approach taken by social justice warriors and purveyors of anti-white rhetoric. The shocking “White Men Are Bad” hot takes serve the same purpose. They are also meant to shock the system. Just as the alt right is willing to denigrate minorities to make plain what they view as racist speech codes, the Left is willing to denigrate straight, white men to make plain what they view as widespread systemic racism.
For both groups the central theme is identity. That theme quickly calcifies into attitudes too brittle to hold up serious discourse. In reducing all phenomena to a question of race, both the alt right and the progressive left ensure the dominance of racial resentment as the lynchpin of our society.
Let’s Find Another Way Forward
W.E.B. Du Bois was born just three years after the end of slavery, but was bullish on the prospects of equality, he writes in “The Souls of Black Folks.”
Work, culture, liberty,—all these we need, not singly but together, not successively but together, each growing and aiding each, and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the Negro people, the ideal of human brotherhood, gained through the unifying ideal of Race; the ideal of fostering and developing the traits and talents of the Negro, not in opposition to or contempt for other races, but rather in large conformity to the greater ideals of the American Republic…
Modern progressives don’t talk about the “greater ideals of the American Republic.” Rather, those ideals have become suspect, empty words used to justify slavery and genocide. But for Du Bois, who was closer to slavery than any of us will ever be, this was not the case. The facile notion that some inherent evil of whiteness must be expunged is anathema to his entire vision of equality and reconciliation.
Put simply, our anti-racism efforts must be refocused away from guilt and confession and towards equality and eradicating irrational judgments based on race. Some on the Left will object, saying that racism is so systemic in society it must be purged before anyone can pretend to treat of others without taking race into account. Some on the Right will object, saying that everything from IQ tests to crime statistics prove something meaningful about the capabilities of individuals based on their race.
Both of these perspectives must be rejected. In their place, we must return to the goal of treating people as individuals, not as representatives of their race.","['fertile', 'ground', 'embodiment', 'of', 'historical', 'evil', 'white', 'supremacists']"
"So Acevedo’s war on gun shows would do little to prevent criminals from getting guns, but it might keep a grandpa from buying a shotgun he was going to use to duck hunt with his grandson.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/04/houston-top-cop-we-do-not-need-prayers-we-need-gun-control/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,84.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo says officers do not need prayers from elected officials, rather they need the passage of more gun control.
Acevedo pushed for more gun control the day after drug suspects opened fire on police officers in Houston, wounding four.
The Washington Post quoted Acevedo saying, “WE DON’T elect people to pray for us. We elect people to lead us.” He added, “I appreciate your prayers … but the question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to address a public-health epidemic?”
CNN reports that the four officers were serving a warrant on the suspected drug dealers. Acevedo’s solution to this scenario is more gun control for law-abiding citizens.
He wants an “assault weapons” ban, a “high-capacity” magazine ban, and a requirement background checks for private gun sellers at gun shows.
On January 15, 2019, Breitbart News reported Department of Justice (DOJ) figures showing that fewer than three percent of prisoners who used guns for crime acquired those guns at a gun show or at retail. The vast majority — 56 percent — stole their guns, acquired them at the scene of a crime, or got them via the black market. So Acevedo’s war on gun shows would do little to prevent criminals from getting guns, but it might keep a grandpa from buying a shotgun he was going to use to duck hunt with his grandson.

"King’s defense understandably rang hollow, as he has a long history of making comments ranging from insensitive to downright unacceptable.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/29/saying-western-civilization-means-white-people-dumb-box-rocks/,federalist,white-nationalism,right,84.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"What made Jewish and Christian faiths different from other faiths of the ancient world was their rejection of racial tribalism in favor of universal truths.
Rep. Steve King’s (R-Iowa) comments on race earlier this month elicited a warranted firestorm of indignation across American politics and media. In an interview with The New York Times , King said: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King responded by claiming that his syntax was misrepresented and that he was defending “Western civilization” rather than white supremacy or white nationalism.
King’s defense understandably rang hollow, as he has a long history of making comments ranging from insensitive to downright unacceptable. From the Left, many have claimed that that the term Western civilization has always been used to justify white racial superiority. Yet for those of us who study history, though, it is abundantly clear that Western civilization, both as a concept and in practice, has never meant white civilization.
Indeed, when properly understood, it is the most universal human project in history. King fails to recognize this, but it’s worth exploring how early Judaism and Christianity rejected racial and cultural division.
Western Civilization’s Ancient Universalizing Tendencies
The universal nature of Western civilization is visible in the ancient writings of the first great monotheistic religion, Judaism. This may at first seem inherently contradictory—was not the Jewish faith known for its exclusivity and strict ethnic boundaries? Doesn’t the Hebrew Bible contain stories of the Jewish people massacring other people groups in the promised land, indeed, eradicating them?
Moreover, the Jewish god YHWH (or Yahweh) is strident and uncompromising in his demand that his covenant people not miscegenate with the local pagan peoples of the Levant. This, however, is a limited and incomplete interpretation of God’s intention for the Jewish people.
Yes, YHWH called the Jewish people to a strict monotheistic exclusivity, but this was by no means along racial or ethnic lines. Indeed, the Old Testament is littered with examples of non-Jewish individuals being blessed by God, and even welcomed into the covenant community.
An oft-overlooked story in the Torah is that of Miriam and Aaron’s criticism of Moses for marrying a Cushite woman, and their attempt to use this to undermine his authority (Numbers 12). The Cushites were an African people, meaning Moses’ wife was probably black, especially given how YHWH responds—he punishes Miriam by making her leprous. In other words, if Miriam is proud of her skin color, God will make her as white as possible!
God also spares the Gentile, meaning non-Jewish, harlot Rahab when Joshua attacks Jericho, and she becomes a member of the covenant people. She is even named as an ancestor of Jesus in Matthew’s gospel. Another messianic ancestor is Ruth, a Moabite woman who marries a Jewish man. The prophet Elijah in turn raises the son of a widow from Zarephath, a pagan Phoenician city.
On a more theological plane, YHWH’s covenant with the Jewish people was intended as a witness to the peoples of the earth, one that orients all races and ethnicities toward worship of the one, true God. This is in stark contrast to the deities of the ancient world, who were typically not universal, but wedded to particular places and particular peoples. YHWH promises Abraham that “all the nations of the earth” will be blessed by his descendants (Genesis 22:18).
The psalms pick up this theme: “All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD; and all the families of the nations shall worship before him” (Psalm 22:27). We read of God’s “saving power among the nations” (Psalm 67:2), and that “all the nations you have made shall come and bow down before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name” (Psalm 86:9). This theme is consistent across the prophets: Isaiah 52:10, Amos 9:12, Zechariah 8:22, Jeremiah 16:19, among others, all make reference to a universal salvation meant for all peoples.
A Truly ‘Catholic’ Christian Civilization
The promises of this salvation reach their fulfillment in the person and message of Christ, who himself preaches to and heals the Gentile peoples living among and nearby the Jews (Matthew 15, Luke 7). On Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descends upon the small band of Christ’s followers and enables them to speak in many of the languages of the ancient world (Acts 2). Thus begins the expansion of the church and the Christian faith across the Roman Empire and beyond, including the conversion of an Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8), whom the Ethiopian Orthodox Church views as one of the founders of its unique brand of Christianity.
Among the great theological contributors of early church are many Africans, including Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, and, of course, Augustine. The last is widely recognized as one of the intellectual giants of the ancient world, and foundational to both Western theology and philosophy, especially in his “City of God,” which proposes a global spiritual society.
As Robert Louis Wilken expertly recounts in his “ The First Thousand Years ,” Christianity’s movements west pivoted the locus of the faith to Rome, but it also had deep roots across the east. In addition to North Africa and Ethiopia, Christian missionaries had success in the Middle East, Persia, India, and China. Archaeologists have discovered the remnants of Nestorian Christian communities in China, while the Western Church had periodic, limited contact with the Syro-Malabar Church of India throughout the ancient and medieval period, ties which were strengthened once Portuguese explorers arrived in the late fifteenth century.
Inasmuch as Christianity is a component of Western civilization, the latter is an inherently universal, and racially and ethnically diverse organism. Indeed, one of the most remarkable qualities of Christianity has always been its ability to borrow, re-fashion, and incorporate concepts and practices from various cultures into its own beliefs and praxis. One need only look at the etymology of concepts like liturgy and sacrament or the doctrine of the Trinity to see how much the faith is indebted to the Greeks and Romans, among other cultures.
Western Civilization In The Americas Was Never All-White
Even in an American context, the paradigm of Western civilization has been far more complex than something that can be reducible to a single race. Consider the role of the American Indian. Although the European settlers often had aggressive and violent interactions with the original inhabitants of North and South America, it is impossible to imagine an American identity apart from the contributions made by the native peoples.
These are visible in geographic place names (Alabama, Illinois), words in American language (both English and Spanish), cuisine (corn), sports (lacrosse), and literature and the arts. From James Fenimore Cooper’s “Last of the Mohicans” to practically every American Western movie ever made, the Native American experience, even when trivialized or poorly represented, is palpable as a reminder of their place in our historical cultural memory.
The role of African-Americans is perhaps even more central to the idea of an American identity as a subset of Western civilization. Much of the United States, both north and south, was built upon the backs of black slaves and freedmen, as was the Caribbean and large chunks of South America, including Brazil, where slavery wasn’t outlawed until 1888.
Moreover, it is simply impossible to imagine an American identity without the contributions of black writers, musicians, inventors, politicians, and athletes. An America without the blues or jazz would be an impoverished America, as would be an America without the eloquence of Frederick Douglass, profundity of Langston Hughes, or spiritual leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Surely all of these are an indelible part of Western civilization in an American context. The same can just as much be said for Asian-Americans, many of whose ancestors built the infrastructure of our nation and have added to it layers of cultural complexity across the same areas cited above.
What made the Jewish and Christian faiths so different from the other belief systems of the ancient world was their fundamental rejection of racial and ethnic tribalism in favor of universal truths and values. In this respect, they also joined with other early contributors to the idea of Western Civilization : ancient Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Plato proposed a universal logos or “rational structure” that encompassed the cosmos, while Roman statesman Cicero declared that “one eternal and unchanging law” can “bind together all races in every era.”
Early Christian writers in turn set the foundation for the possibility of a unified Western civilization between Jews, Greeks, and Romans. For example, St. Paul cites with approval the pagan Greek writers Epimenides and Aratus: “For in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children’” (Acts 17:28). St. John meanwhile borrows from Greek philosophy when he refers to Jesus as the divine logos (John 1).
There is no room for “blood and soil” in the Western tradition, at least not in the sense of racial or ethnic superiority. The West’s very nature, from its beginnings in Athens, Jerusalem, and Rome, was always oriented towards universal truths that transcend our ancient tendencies towards arrogant tribalism.
Of course, a significant part of Western civilization owes its creation and preservation to people who would probably identity as “white.” But insofar as we reduce Western civilization to something racial, we undermine its true intellectual and spiritual potency, something capable of appealing to all humans precisely because it reflects what is good, true, and beautiful across all people groups. To equate Western Civilization with something as pedestrian as “white civilization” is, in effect, to stop believing and participating in it altogether.","['rang', 'hollow', 'downright', 'insensitive', 'unacceptable']"
"We might note that at the time of this Texas ruling, national liberals were spluttering with outraged opposition.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/01/01/pinkerton-the-attacks-in-new-york-and-texas-move-the-gun-control-debate-in-the-direction-the-founders-wanted/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gun-control,right,85.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Two bloody tragedies, just a few hours apart on December 28-29—the mass stabbings at a synagogue in Monsey, New York, and the thwarted mass shooting at a church in Forth Worth, Texas—have put questions about guns and public safety in a valuable new light. How do we stay safe? Especially in our houses of worship? And what should we do about the menace of marauders in our midst?
Yet at the same time, we could also say that the New York and Texas attacks put the public safety issue in a valuable old light. How so? Because we are seeing the right of each state to make its own decisions—for better or for worse, as the case might be—as enshrined in our founding document, the U.S. Constitution.
That is, the Founders fully intended for the states, not the central government, to take responsibility for many matters. As James Madison wrote in Federalist #45, published in 1788 as the Constitution was being ratified, “In the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects. … The [state] governments … will retain their due authority and activity.”
This is federalism. Federalism is the principle that the states should be sovereign, operating within our national federal system; as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in 1932, the individual states should each be “laboratories of democracy.” Hopefully, over the long run, these “laboratories” will all find their way to better results, although, of course, there can be no guarantee that every state will do the smart thing.
Sometimes, perhaps the best we can hope for is that the failures of some states will at least provide instruction to the others; as Army drill sergeants say to dud recruits, You can still serve a useful purpose—as a bad example!
So now, in the last few days, we’ve seen the results of two grisly “experiments” within our federal system. In New York, the assailant at the Netzach Yisroel congregation managed to stab five worshipers before he was subdued by the police. In Texas, the assailant at the West Freeway Church of Christ managed to shoot and kill two innocent victims before he himself was killed by an armed parishioner. The Fort Worth cops were rushing to the church, and yet, were it not for heroes already on the premises, the assailant might have killed many more in those precious seconds and minutes.
Indeed, Texas Department of Public Safety Director Joeff Williams paid tribute to West Freeway’s vigilant guardians on the afternoon of December 29: “The citizens who were inside that church undoubtedly saved 242 other parishioners. … It was miraculous. … [They were] true heroes.”
And Williams’ Republican boss, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, has been fully supportive of the armed-citizen concept; and as Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick added, “The immediate responder is the most important.”
In fact, the state’s Republican leadership as a whole deserves credit for helping keep churchgoers safe. As The Forth Worth Star-Telegram reported, a 2017 legal ruling from the state’s attorney general clarified the legal right of churchgoers (with the church’s permission) to bear the arms needed to defend the congregation:
A Texas law went into effect in September 2017 that allows churches to hire armed guards. Attorney General Ken Paxton clarified months later that the law also allows licensed handgun owners to bring their firearms to church as long as the church does not oppose it. The clarification was released in an opinion by Paxton after a November 2017 shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Twenty-six people were fatally shot, and another 20 were wounded.
We might note that at the time of this Texas ruling, national liberals were spluttering with outraged opposition. For instance, in 2017, Joe Biden sniffed about Paxton’s legal brief, “It’s just absolutely irrational. It’s totally irrational.”
Yet now, in 2019, we can see the life-and-death difference that robust self-defense can make: If an evil-minded gunman walks into an undefended church, he can kill or injure scores. But if an evil-doer walks into a defended church, he himself is dead within seconds. Sorry, Middle Class Joe: It’s totally rational for churches to be prepared for trouble.
As the West Freeway church’s senior minister, Britt Farmer, said on December 29, “I’m thankful our government has allowed us the opportunity to protect ourselves.”
Farmer’s words thus echo what National Rifle Association President Wayne LaPierre said back in 2012: “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.”
Ever since, the Main Stream Media has been scoffing at LaPierre’s words. For instance, here’s a 2018 headline from our friends at ABC News: “Breaking down the NRA-backed theory that a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun.” The MSM, in other words, seems to think that if a conservative issue is just “broken down” and “explained” better, then conservatives will see the error of their ways and become liberals.
Or maybe not. As Brad Palumbo recently wrote in the Washington Examiner:
Many Democrats and liberal media figures sneer at the “good guy with a gun” narrative when it comes to the debate over gun control, dismissing it as a myth clung to by Bible-thumping rednecks. Yet, if there was ever a single incident to remind us just how wrong they are, it’s the tragic church shooting that was thankfully stopped in its tracks on Sunday.
And yet, it’s not just Fort Worth. Studies show that good guys with guns thwart hundreds of thousands of crimes a year.
Still, not everyone agrees with Texas’s safety logic, and in our Madisonian federal system, states have the right to disagree with each other. For instance, New York is led by Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo; he’s one of those Wall Street-oriented progressives; that is, a Mike Bloomberg type. Indeed, Bloomberg must be pleased with Cuomo’s devotion to his cause, no matter what.
So we can see: Two different states—the Lone Star State, run by a Republican, and the Empire State, run by a Democrat—have chosen two different responses to horrible challenges. These states aren’t just laboratories of democracy; they are also laboratories of public safety.
In the meantime, as we watch this ongoing process of democratic experimentation unfold, we might reach a few conclusions, five, in fact:
First, it should be better understood that choices about guns can be a key issue in any state. For instance, when New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz first heard the news, she was terse and to the point: “We need guns.” A few minutes later, she added, “Every synagogue needs an armed guard. Every synagogue needs armed worshipers.”
Yet as we have seen, worshipers in Texas are already free to arm and to protect themselves—and so now, what sort of self-defense is legal in New York? Are New Yorkers happy with their liberal anti-gun governor? Are they happy with the status quo? We’ll know more in the next statewide election. In fact, we’re already seeing plenty of evidence–visual evidence, complete with the open carrying of self-defense weapons—that Jews in the New York region are taking seriously the threats they face from lowlifes; so now we’ll have to stay tuned as Cuomo/Bloomberg-type liberals evaluate this new challenge to their gun-control zeal.
Second, pro-Second Amendment forces, joined by others concerned about public safety, should draft up language replicating that of Texas Attorney General Paxton in clarifying gun rights in holy places. The idea would be to make sure that any congregation is guaranteed the right to be as safe as was the West Freeway church. Indeed, such language could be turned into a campaign pledge that candidates could be asked to make during election campaigns. We could call it the Church Protection Pledge.
Third, let’s ask: How quickly can President Trump bring together these heroes—the hero-defenders in Texas, at least one of whom, Jack Wilson, has been identified, and the hero-cops in New York, who have also been identified–to a televised ceremony at the White House? All these heroes certainly deserve honoring, both the volunteers and the police.
As Trump said of the good-guys-with-guns in a tweet on December 30, “Lives were saved by these heroes, and [by] Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!” So now, an in-person White House moment would send a valuable further signal to the nation—namely, that gun and self-defense rights are worth protecting, and that true heroes are worth truly honoring. If the Democrats don’t approve of such protecting and honoring, they are free, of course, to criticize.
Fourth, We need to take a hard look at policies that let active criminals run free; it’s one thing to show clemency to elderly prisoners who are clearly past the age of active criminality. It’s quite another thing to let young suspects loose, often with no bail, and even young convicts loose, often with no sentence. In the words of Liel Leibowitz, writing for the Jewish publication Tablet, “Letting violent, hate-filled bigots walk free to commit more violent hate crimes as a matter of public policy is the definition of insanity. It’s evil.” In fact, as of January 1, New York State has further loosened its laws. Note to New Yorkers and potential tourists: The bad old crime days of the 1970s are already making a comeback, and the problem will only get worse.
Fifth, we should find new and permanent ways to celebrate these heroes—the good guys with the guns, whether or not the guns actually had to be used. As we know, the left finds a way to celebrate its heroes; so we on the right should celebrate our heroes.
It would be cool for conservative activists to hail the courage of these stalwarts who confronted evil, looked it in the eye—and shot it dead. (Or otherwise brought the wicked to justice.) Indeed, such hailing could be regularized and systematized—on new media, social media, any kind of media—across the nation. There are, after all, such brave and resolute heroes in every state, and they all deserve to be valorized.
We might also note that these days, video cameras seem omnipresent—because of security cameras, as well as smart phones, drones, etc.—and so we find ourselves in an interesting situation, in which that many remarkable events are now digitally recorded. In other words, the deeds of heroes are likely to remembered forever, if, that is, we take the trouble to remember them. So the challenge to the right is to remember, with an eye toward replication: The more we lionize heroes, the more heroic lions we are likely to get. And we need them, now more than ever!
Once again, if the Democrats disagree as to who’s a hero, they are free to criticize. And that should be fine with Republicans, because under our Constitution, everyone is free to be right—or wrong.
In fact, it’s hard to think of better ground on which to fight the 2020 election—or any election.","['spluttering', 'liberals', 'outraged']"

Colorado students walked out of an event billed as a vigil for Kendrick Castillo, an 18-year-old killed in a shooting at his school on Tuesday, when prominent speakers attempted to turn it into a rally for gun control. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colorado) each took a turn calling for gun control at the Douglas County event before students streamed out in protest.
Two students at STEM Highlands Ranch, a K-12 charter school focused on science, technology, engineering, and math, shot nine students, one fatally. The accused students, who were arrested, are an adult male and a juvenile female who identifies as male. The accused male had written anti-Christian social media messages. He drove a car with a pentagram spray-painted on the hood, as well as other graffiti:
In response to the shooting, a public vigil was announced at another local public high school: Highlands Ranch High School. It was sponsored by the gun control groups Brady’s Team Enough and March for Our Lives and featured Democratic politicians who seek limits on Second Amendment gun rights, but was billed instead as an event to remember and honor Castillo and other victims. As the politicians called for gun control, students left in protest over the politicization of the deaths and injuries.
Bennet, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president and is pictured in the tweet below, said, “We live in a great country, but we need to fix these broken gun laws.”

Students then returned to the gymnasium, taking over the event, complaining about adults politicizing what they hoped would be a remembrance of their friend Castillo, a young man with an interest in robotics who had heroically rushed a shooter. Students also gave Bennet a piece of their mind, telling him to focus on “mental health” issues.

Are they right?
Earlier this week in the Washington Post, George Will declared that the current riots, COVID, and the collective economic fallout are the death knell of the Trump presidency. Will admits Trump is not the genesis of any of the aforementioned crises but blames him for making them worse. Will believes this can, and should, lead to Trump’s downfall.
Until a few months ago, the booming economy made Trump an all-but-unbeatable incumbent. But with the ongoing pandemic and the unrest of recent days, the nation may be swayed by low morale, economic devastation, and loss of confidence in the commander in chief.
Then again, the media continues its deceptive coverage of the riots and accuses all white people of racism—as though Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd’s murders are not repulsive to all Americans. These are the same failed leftist tactics that helped get Trump elected in 2016. If they keep it up, Trump’s defeat may become wishful thinking on the part of those who have never understood Trump’s people or his appeal.
The Left Still Doesn’t Get Trump or the American People
Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them?
Admittedly, Donald Trump is not who I would have chosen for our nation’s highest office. But the fact remains our fellow Americans elected him. He reflects our current political experience. We cannot dismiss Trump and what he stands for without also dismissing the views of the millions of men and women who choose him to be president. Who in their right mind watches these riots and begs for a Biden presidency?
Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Even if Trump loses in November, millions will still want the kind of policies and leadership that Donald Trump gave them. To ignore them is to invite further division and civil unrest.
No One Makes Americans Feel More Understood than Trump
Will’s rant calls to mind a trip I took to NYC with a friend a few months ago. On our drive home, the car stalled. We ended up taking an hour and a half ride in a tow truck to drag the car from Staten Island to Trenton, NJ.
As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. I can only imagine what he thinks of these protests rage through Manhattan and into his neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Here’s why the Never Trumpers can’t succeed: there’s nothing George Will, Joe Biden, or anyone else can say to this tow truck driver to make him feel more understood, validated, and empowered than Donald Trump does. Frankly, they don’t want this man’s support—but Donald Trump does.
After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government.
Can Anything Stop Donald Trump?
There’s another reality the Never Trumpers and the left can’t see: if you voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he’s delivered on almost every promise he’s made to you. No, there is no border wall that Mexico has paid for. Still, this is largely the fault of Congress and the judiciary. On issues like deregulation, economic growth, and the federal courts, Trump has exceeded the expectations of his voters.
Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. So long as the left keeps violating Americans’ sense of justice, voters will stick with the guy they trust to restore it.
They’re Not After Trump, They’re After You
Trump himself put it best in a tweet posted last year.
“In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I’m just in the way.”
This is what causes the loyalty that Trump supporters have for their Commander-in-Chief. They recognize that the left’s attacks on Trump are actually attacks on them. Just like the left has attacked Trump for his SCOTUS picks, or pro-life stance, now they’re attacking him for “stoking racial tensions” and accuse him of using “aggressive tactics” to restore law and order.
Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief.
After this national tragedy quiets down, there will be no shortage of voices telling the American people that they should be ashamed of themselves. I assure you, Joe Biden will be chief among them. Donald Trump will lose no support if he can keep doing what he’s always done for his loyal followers: make them feel proud to be American.","['racial', 'tensions']"
Mainstream media outlets continue to print false and defamatory descriptions of Breitbart News in a nakedly political effort to marginalize a growing competitor.,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2017/01/30/fakenews-mainstream-media-continue-slander-breitbart/,breitbart,white-nationalism,right,85.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Mainstream media outlets continue to print false and defamatory descriptions of Breitbart News in a nakedly political effort to marginalize a growing competitor.
In a news article on Sunday about the appointment of former Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon to the National Security Council, for example, National Public Radio’s Merrit Kennedy described Breitbart News “a far-right media outlet that has promoted conspiracy theories” and claimed that it “espouses white nationalism.” She provided no evidence whatsoever to back up any of her false claims.
Similarly, in its own article about Bannon, the New York Times called Breitbart News “a magnet for white nationalists, antiglobalists and conspiracy theorists.” Though there are certainly “antiglobalists” writing for Breitbart (and for the New York Times), there are no white nationalists or conspiracy theorists — and, of course, the Times provides no evidence to back up its false assertions.
The Washington Post contented itself with attacking Breitbart’s audience, calling Breitbart News “a conservative website popular with white nationalists.”

The Post provided no evidence whatsoever to back up its claim, which more closely resembles left-wing agitprop than news reporting.
The spate of false reporting was reflected in the lead story at Media Matters for America, a “non-profit” organization devoted to attacking conservative media — and, in a new plan, to ousting the Trump administration. Media Matters said “Bannon is an extremist anti-Semite who formerly ran the white nationalist “alt-right” website Breitbart.com.”

Brown/AFP/Getty Images Bannon rips Bush, Silicon Valley 'lords of technology' In a defiant speech to California Republicans, the Breitbart chief cast the state as a linchpin in the fight to halt the globalist agenda.
ANAHEIM, Calif. — Issuing a defiant call to arms to grassroots Republicans, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon railed Friday against dangerous “global elites” and the Silicon Valley “lords of technology” whom he said are robbing U.S. citizens of jobs, wealth and opportunity.
“They want all the benefits of a free society...all the benefits of this rules-based international order,’’ including lucrative trade deals and capital markets, he said, while “we the citizens of the United States...underwrite the whole thing.”

Bannon also launched a blistering attack on a former President George W. Bush — who this week delivered a rebuke of President Donald Trump — casting him as a tool of those globalists.
“President Bush embarrassed himself,’’ Bannon said, referring to him as “a piece of work.” “It is clear he didn’t understanding anything he was talking about...he had no idea whether he was coming or going — just like when he was president of the United States.’’
“There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush’s,’’ he said to applause.
Bannon delivered the comments to a wildly enthusiastic sold-out crowd of 500 at the state GOP convention, where he was greeted with a standing ovation. Security was tight, with double lines of fencing outside the Anaheim Marriott, and lines of police officers on hand for protesters who promised to show up but never materialized in large numbers.
Delegates paid $100 for dinner with the former White House senior adviser who has returned to his post as Breitbart News executive chairman and many ponied up $300 for a gold-plated pass that included a VIP reception and a photo with Bannon — the kind of buy-in usually reserved for elected officials and rock stars. Entering the convention hall, Bannon was greeted with cheers and mobbed by party activists aiming to grab selfies.
In his address to California Republicans — much of it delivered off-the-cuff — Bannon aimed squarely at some favorite conservative targets, including sanctuary cities.
“You’ve got a very dangerous thing going on in this state,’’ said Bannon, likening California in 2017 to South Carolina in the 1830’s, a state he said also tried to “pick and choose the laws they want,’’ before it it pulled away from the Union.

“You are a sanctuary state — and trust me, if you do not roll this back, 10 or 15 years from now, the folks in Silicon Valley and the progressive left in this state are going to try to secede from the Union.”
But Bannon — the former Harvard Business School grad, Goldman Sachs managing director, and Hollywood mogul — cast California as a linchpin in the fight to halt the spread of what he called the globalist and elitist agenda. He urged Republicans to organize, rise up — and put up a fight to hold on to California House seats that are considered vulnerable in 2018.
“It’s time for California to start having some victories,’’ he said. “[Progressives] are going to drag us so far to the left that we’re going to hold those districts and Nancy Pelosi is not going to get her opportunity to impeach the president of the United States.”
Bannon, in his 40-minute address, didn’t disappoint an adoring crowd, casting himself as a populist conservative and political pugilist who has kicked off an epic battle between old guard, establishment Republicans and his army of activist followers in the 2018 midterms.
To many in the audience who greeted Bannon’s speech with cheers and shouts, the Breitbart executive’s decision to take his fight to solidly blue California — a state where Democrats hold a 15-point voter registration advantage, every major statewide office and super-majorities in both houses of the legislature — served as a shot of adrenaline to a state party that has slipped to near irrelevance.
Some Republicans greeted Bannon’s choice of targets with praise.
Harmeet Dhillon, the San Francisco attorney who is also a member of the Republican National Committee — and who represents James Damore, the Google engineer who was fired earlier this year after writing a controversial memo on diversity — said she welcomed Bannon’s focus on Silicon Valley.
“For every James Damore, there’s a thousand others who get fired,’’ said Dhillon, who has also represented UC Berkeley College Republicans in their efforts to bring conservative speakers like Milo Yiannopoulos to campus. “Silicon Valley corporations like Twitter, Google...systematically suppress the voices of conservative bloggers, voices and citizens. So think they should be taken to task on free speech issues.”
But other activists in attendance expressed concerns that Bannon was overly divisive.
Conyers Davis, who worked in George W. Bush’s administration, said after the speech that Bannon’s rhetoric was “really scary,” contrasting it with what he called a message of civility from Bush in New York the previous day.
Bush, he said, is a “proven winner. And if you look at the current administration, they’re doing anything but winning.”
Yet Bannon’s attacks on establishment politicians were generally well received. When he mentioned Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain — the former POW whose name was met with boos — someone in the audience yelled, “Hang him!”
Here in Orange County, the once-vaunted stronghold of Republican conservatism, Bannon’s presence fired up hard-right conservatives who charged that the collapse of the California GOP is directly related to efforts to moderate the party message and capitulate on issues like illegal immigration, anti-terrorism efforts, free trade and globalism.
“Intellectually and ideologically, the energy of what is left of the conservative movement here is absolutely with Bannon — and he’s the only reason a lot of these people are coming to the convention,’’ said Tim Donnelly, a former state assemblyman and co-founder of the Minutemen — and a self-declared member of Bannon’s “anti-establishment” wing of the party.
Bannon’s draw is that he represents the “complete opposite” of establishment state GOP leaders like its chairman Jim Brulte, a former state senator, whom Donnelly charged has “turned the party into “Democrats lite,’’ and “wants to hand over the state to people who are in the country illegally, at the cost of the future of California’s kids.”
Donnelly last week became the first California candidate to seize on Bannon’s call for “war,’’ and launched a challenge against GOP Rep. Paul Cook, charging that he alone will “have President Trump’s back” on key issues. Donnelly met with Bannon prior to the speech -- but the Breitbart executive has yet to endorse any candidates in California races.
Bannon sought to reassure the embattled party activists that the GOP could take back the reins in a majority-minority state that is increasingly tacking to the left.
“It looks like now, it’s impossible to do anything in California,’’ he said. “The media’s against you, the culture’s against you…[but] you have got everything you need to win...you’ve got big ideas, you have the grassroots, you’ve got muscle.”
He urged conservatives to support Trump’s agenda,’’ adding “the future of this state is in your hands, I mean that.”
Bannon is not universally known among California Republicans, but he has considerable support. Among California Republicans, 41 percent view Bannon favorably and 33 percent unfavorably, according to a poll of California voters by Sextant Strategies for Capitol Weekly.
Still, some centrist Republicans expressed concern that Bannon’s appearance would be taken as a signal that in California — birthplace of the Reagan Revolution — the GOP grassroots is ready to embrace some of the strategist’s nationalist positions.
Luis Alvarado, a longtime party strategist who has declared himself a #NeverTrump Republican, said he could only hope that Bannon’s address “will not be something that causes harm” — a reference to white nationalist, anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic groups who have appeared to be energized by both Breitbart coverage and Bannon himself.
Democrats wasted no time fundraising on Bannon’s address, with Congresswoman Nanette Barragan sending out a letter reminding Democrats that “the same guy who runs a website promoting white supremacists and Neo-Nazis is being embraced by California Republicans.”
And billionaire activist Tom Steyer — who is reported to be launching a $10 million ad campaign aimed to getting out a message to impeach Trump — tweeted that “California is doing just fine without the racist, divisive blather that Mr. Bannon is peddling.”","['railed', 'robbing', 'defiant']"
The House Democrats’ coronavirus recovery bill allows several hundred thousand foreign workers to get college jobs or blue-collar jobs while millions of Americans lose their careers.,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/23/democrats-push-foreign-graduates-first-clause-in-coronavirus-bill/,breitbart,coronavirus,right,85.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The House Democrats’ coronavirus recovery bill allows several hundred thousand foreign workers to get college jobs or blue-collar jobs while millions of Americans lose their careers.
“I can’t even believe they have the nerve to spit in the face of Americans who are now unemployed,” said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at the NumbersUSA. The GOP and President Donald Trump must oppose the “Foreign Workers First bill,” she said. “Americans are being laid off right and left … Americans are going to need all the help they can get.”
“Congress seems hell-bent on replacing Americans with foreigners,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “We’re going to have 30 percent unemployment or more — higher than the Great Depression — and yet we are going to bring in more people from abroad? It surreal.”
“This House bill is disgusting,” said Marie Larson, a co-founder of the American Workers Coalition, which organizes U.S. graduates to oppose companies’ growing use of foreign visa workers. “It is an overreach; it has to be called out.”
“During the public health emergency …. [officials] shall temporarily suspend or modify any procedural requirement with which an applicant, petitioner, or other person or entity must otherwise comply under the immigration law,” says Sec. 10607 on page 63 of the 1,119-page House draft.
The suspensions are intended to “ensure the timely and fair adjudication of applications or petitions … [to] prevent hardship to applicants, petitions, beneficiaries, or other persons or entities, including by granting automatic or other extensions or renewals when necessary to protect individuals from lapses in status or work authorizations.”
At a time when millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Pelosi’s bill includes a measure to automatically extend nonimmigrant work visas. https://t.co/t1n9nWFC0W pic.twitter.com/MvXTKrBnIn — Ben Goldey (@BenGoldey) March 23, 2020
The bill would even allow H-1B visa workers to stay long past the six-term limit on their temporary stays. For example, the foreign workers who are expected to go home in the next 12 months will instead be allowed to “automatically extend such status or work authorization for the same time period as the alien’s prior status or work authorization.” For H-1Bs, the “same time period’ is three years.
The bill would keep several hundred thousand white-collar visa workers and several hundred thousand blue-collar work-permit workers in the U.S. labor market, even as unemployment is expected to spike past 20 percent.
The bill would also provide a massive giveaway to the many technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies that have replaced a huge number of U.S. graduates with large blocs of compliant Indian and Chinese graduates.
Without the House language, these wealthy companies would be forced to hire hundreds of thousands of American graduates if their lobbyists cannot persuade the administration to renew the foreign workers’ expiring permits during the massive surge of unemployment among white-collar Americans before the 2020 election.
The visa extensions are backed by FWD.us, a lobby group for West Coast Investors.
The legislation also matches the goals of Compete America. The lobby group has been pushing Congress to pass the S.386 green card giveaway to roughly 300,0000 Indian Hi-1B workers who are employed in the United States by technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies.
In mid-March, the Department of Homeland Security said it had not stopped plans to deliver 85,000 college-graduate H-1B visa workers to U.S companies.
“You could make an argument for extending current visas, just to prevent disruption,” said Krikorian. “Paired with that would have to be a freeze on future visas [because] you can’t have it both ways – then everyone gets to stay, and more new people would be allowed in,” he said.
‘If your time is up, you should need to go home,” Krikorian added.
“I would hope that the administration would oppose it,” said Jenks, adding:
American workers are going to need all the help they can get. We need to focus on putting Americans back to work … Hopefully, we will start getting the economy rolling again in less than 43 months, and those jobs are going to be needed by Americans who are being laid off.
“I’m not sure this would be [bad] enough for Trump to veto this bill,” said Kirkorian, adding:
There is so much else going on and in such a panic. I expect that the tech lobbyists’ are counting on Trump being very reluctant to veto this bill. Really, the responsibility is on Republican legislatures to make sure he is not presented with that choice. The problem is that the Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats when it comes to preferring visa workers over Americans, but there are some honorable exceptions.
Democrats are trying to make Trump eat a “cap sandwich,” Krikorian said. The Republicans’ job “is to make sure the President is not presented with distasteful actions like this.”

American professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers. The new TechsUnite.US site was created to help U.S. graduates anonymously collaborate while shielded by encryption.
In turn, these groups are backed up by a few sites that track the scale and location of the outsourcing industry in each legislator’s district. The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. “The scope of this thing is really unbelievable,” said one researcher.
Other sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.",[]
"Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/21/transgenderism-a-mans-penis-can-be-a-female-penis/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+breitbart+%28Breitbart+News%29,breitbart,gender,right,85.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"A man’s penis becomes a female penis once a man declares himself to be transgender, says Indya Moore, one of the players in a transgender-themed TV show on FX network.
If a woman has a penis, her penis is a biologically female penis. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 17, 2019
The declaration is built on the transgender claim that men who say they are women are actually women. But once the men are women, their bodies are women’s bodies. So men’s penises become female penises.
Moore extended the “female penis” claim by declaring the existence of ‘male vaginas,’ which are presumably carried by women who are living as men.
The “female penis” claim went viral because it spotlights the logic of the transgender ideology, which insists the Department of Justice must blur and forbid any legal or civic recognition of the biological distinctions between the two different and complementary male and female sexes.
This policy must be imposed to ensure that children and adults can easily discard their female or male sex by simply declaring they have an opposite-sex “gender,” or have a “gender identity” which is between male and female, say transgender activists.
A person’s “gender,” say activists, is their personal feeling about being female or male, or something in between. For example, Moore’s feelings are described as “binary,” or neither male nor female.
I am a biological non binary. — IAM (@IndyaMoore) February 20, 2019
Moore’s feelings-are-more-important-than-biology logic was explained by another transgender writer:
Moore took the often-heard rallying cry “trans women are women” one step further: She argued that if trans women are biological women, by definition, a trans woman’s penis is “a biologically female penis.” That’s a radical point missing in mainstream discussions on trans bodies, as trans women are often made to feel as if they should be ashamed of their genitals if they don’t have a vagina.
“Don’t use science to justify your bigotry,” Moore tweeted at critics of the “female penis” claim. “The world is way too weird for that s**t.”
The transgender effort to suppress any recognition that men and women are different and complementary would not matter except for the movement’s political alliance with wealthy progressives and radical feminists who wish to destroy the political power of the male-and-female family.
For example, editors at the New York Times invited a February 7 op-ed which smeared women who reject the political claim that gender is more important than biology. Author Sophie Lewis described the vast majority of women as “terfs”:
… the most vocal trans-exclusionary voices are, ostensibly, “feminist” ones, and anti-trans lobbying is a mainstream activity. Case in point: Ms. Parker told the podcast “Feminist Current” that she’d changed her thinking on trans women after spending time on Mumsnet, a site where parents exchange tips on toilet training and how to get their children to eat vegetables. If such a place sounds benign, consider the words of British writer Edie Miller: “Mumsnet is to British transphobia,” she wrote “what 4Chan is to American fascism.” The term coined to identify women like Ms. Parker and Dr. Long is TERF, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In Britain, TERFs are a powerful force. If, in the United States, the mainstream media has been alarmingly ready to hear “both sides” on the question of trans people’s right to exist, in Britain, TERFs have effectively succeeded in framing the question of trans rights entirely around their own concerns: that is, how these rights for others could contribute to “female erasure.” Many prominent figures in British journalism and politics have been TERFs; British TV has made a sport of endlessly hosting their lurid rudeness and styling it as courage; British newspapers seemingly never tire of broadsides against the menace of “gender ideology.” (With time, the term TERF has become a catchall for all anti-trans feminists, radical or not.)
Lewis’ radical support for the transgender ideology is logical because she wants to minimize the role of male-and-female families. A review of her book, Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family, says:
Rather than making [birth] surrogacy illegal or allowing it to continue as is, Sophie Lewis argues we should be looking to radically transform it. Surrogates should be put front and center, and their rights to the babies they gestate should be expanded to acknowledge that they are more than mere vessels. In doing so we can break down our assumptions that children necessarily belong to those whose genetics they share. This might sound like a radical proposal but expanding our idea of who children belong to would be a good thing. Taking collective responsibility for children, rather than only caring for the ones we share DNA with, would radically transform notions of kinship. Adopting this expanded concept of surrogacy helps us to see that it always, as the saying goes, takes a village to raise a child.
But Lewis’ ‘Terf’ smear is also aimed at lesbians who wish to maintain a clear distinction between women and men. For example, former tennis star Martina Navratilova is being slammed by political activists for her growing opposition to transgenderism in sports. The Guardian reported February:
The former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has been criticised for “disturbing, upsetting, and deeply transphobic” comments after she argued that allowing transgender women [men] to compete in women’s sporting tournaments was “insane and cheating”. The tennis player and gay rights campaigner first drew criticism from equalities activists and trans athletes when she tweeted in December: “You can’t just proclaim yourself a female and be able to compete against women. There must be some standards, and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.” … “To put the argument at its most basic: a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to [fathering] babies if he so desires. “It’s insane and it’s cheating. I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair.”
The Guardian also saw fit to quote a man who is living as a woman describing Navratilova as beset by “transphobia,” as if the former tennis star is mentally ill.
Democrats argue that It is “cruel and unscientific” to define each person’s legal sex by biology. But if sex is not defined by biology/human nature, it will be redefined by politicians & the transgender lobby – regardless of damage to women, men & children https://t.co/4sjsAj9PrN — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 12, 2018
Navratilova’s criticism of the transgender ideology is increasingly echoed by women who say the ideology will erase society’s understanding of women — and of lesbians — as biologically, sexually, and socially very different from men.
This “biology matters” argument is also being made by Andrew Sullivan, a British-born gay advocate who led the political push to allow single-sex marriages. In a February article titled “The Nature of Sex,” Sullivan argues that a pending Democratic-drafted bill which provides legal recognition and rights to people who try to live as members of the opposite sex:
could put all single-sex institutions, events, or groups in legal jeopardy. It could deny lesbians their own unique safe space, free from any trace of men. The bill, in other words, “undermines the fundamental legal groundwork for recognizing and combating sex-based oppression and sex discrimination against women and girls.”
The transgender push to create legal rights for people living as members of the opposite sex would also threaten the legal rights won by gays and lesbians, Sullivan writes:
If you abandon biology in the matter of sex and gender altogether, you may help trans people live fuller, less conflicted lives; but you also undermine the very meaning of homosexuality. If you follow the current ideology of gender as entirely fluid, you actually subvert and undermine core arguments in defense of gay rights. “A gay man loves and desires other men, and a lesbian desires and loves other women,” explains Sky Gilbert, a drag queen. “This defines the existential state of being gay. If there is no such thing as ‘male’ or ‘female,’ the entire self-definition of gay identity, which we have spent generations seeking to validate and protect from bigots, collapses.” Contemporary transgender ideology is not a complement to gay rights; in some ways it is in active opposition to them.
And the truth is that many lesbians and gay men are quite attached to the concept of sex as a natural, biological, material thing. Yes, we are very well aware that sex can be expressed in many different ways. A drag queen and a rugby player are both biologically men, with different expressions of gender. Indeed, a drag queen can also be a rugby player and express his gender identity in a variety of ways, depending on time and place. But he is still a man. And gay men are defined by our attraction to our own biological sex. We are men and attracted to other men. If the concept of a man is deconstructed, so that someone without a penis is a man, then homosexuality itself is deconstructed. Transgender people pose no threat to us, and the vast majority of gay men and lesbians wholeheartedly support protections for transgender people. But transgenderist ideology — including postmodern conceptions of sex and gender — is indeed a threat to homosexuality, because it is a threat to biological sex as a concept.
A growing percentage of progressives oppose any recognition of the reality that men and women are different. But conservatives and feminists are championing the normal view that women and men are different, Sullivan wrote:Pol
It might be a sign of the end-times, or simply a function of our currently scrambled politics, but [in late January], four feminist activists — three from a self-described radical feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front — appeared on a panel at the Heritage Foundation. Together they argued that sex was fundamentally biological, and not socially constructed, and that there is a difference between women and trans women that needs to be respected. For this, they were given a rousing round of applause by the Trump supporters, religious-right members, natural law theorists, and conservative intellectuals who comprised much of the crowd. If you think I’ve just discovered an extremely potent strain of weed and am hallucinating, check out the video of the event.
Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents.
In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of some sympathy for people with lopsided opposition to the ideology.
The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, and people trying to “detransition” back to their sex, men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say are entitled to women’s’ rights, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and revenue-seeking drug-companies and medical service providers.
Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
Yet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.
The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, children’s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s ideals of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children’s sexual privacy.","['ideology', 'unpopular']"
