"So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/here-are-5-of-trumps-lies-from-his-oval-office-speech-about-his-ridiculous-border-wall-demands/,alternet,immigration,left,1.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Speaking to the country for the first time from the Oval Office Tuesday night, President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for a border wall in a brief speech amid his self-induced government shutdown
Democrats remain completely opposed to the president’s proposal for a wall and arranged to respond to Trump’s remarks shortly after he made them. Ahead of the speech, there was widespread debate about the TV network’s decision to broadcast the speech at all, given Trump’s propensity to lie and mislead about this subject in particular.
Here are five of the lies or misleading statements he made in the address:
1. Trump claimed there is a “security” crisis on the border.
While there has been an increase in children and families crossing the border seeking asylum in recent months, the rate of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is actually much lower than it has been in recent history, as Vox’s Dara Lind explained. The Trump administration’s claims that there is some sort of terrorism risk from the border have been debunked. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.
2. Trump said illegal immigration drives down wages.
One of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. While some economists argue this to be the case for some lower-income workers, many others disagree. But even if it’s true, the impact of immigrants on wages is marginal, and it could be completely wiped out by pro-labor policies that Trump and other Republicans oppose, like raising the minimum wage and protecting unions.
3. Trump lied and said that the Democrats requested a “steel barrier.”
Democrats have not requested a steel barrier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants to spend exactly $0 on the wall — no matter what it’s made out of.
4. Trump said the border wall will pay for itself.
Trump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. There’s no reason to believe this is the case — especially when it’s considered that the government will not only have to pay for the construction of the wall, but for any land seized to build the wall through eminent domain.
5. Trump said the new version of NAFTA will also pay for the wall.
The new version of NAFTA, which Trump calls USMCA, has some minor modifications from the original version. However, there’s no plausible argument that it will somehow pay for the wall. And even if it did, it hasn’t even been passed by Congress yet.",['crisis']
The Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. ,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/auto-industry-trump-youre-going-the-wrong-way-emissions,msnbc,environment,left,1.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In Barack Obama’s first term, the administration came to a fairly obvious conclusion: to address the climate crisis, we’re going to need to reduce emissions, and in the United States, the #1 source of carbon pollution is transportation. With that in mind, the Democratic White House created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.
Manufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.
Then Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.
By way of a defense, the Trump administration said the new policy would improve auto safety – which as we discussed at the time, makes about as much sense as it sounds.
Nevertheless, the Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. But the New York Times reports today on an unexpected twist: auto manufacturers believe the White House’s anti-climate plans have gone too far.
The world’s largest automakers warned President Trump on Thursday that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts – his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards – threatens to cut their profits and produce “untenable” instability in a crucial manufacturing sector. In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to fight climate change.
The problem for the industry has become a practical one: Trump intends to go so far in gutting pollution safeguards that many states intend to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.
That includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.
The result is an exceedingly messy economic dynamic, in which car manufacturers in the United States – which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy – will have to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.
Not surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.
The industry seems to realize this is a mess it helped create: companies wanted Trump to roll back Obama-era standards, so he did. What manufacturers didn’t realize is (a) how far the Republican would go; and (b) what would happen if they got what they wanted.
Complicating matters, of course, there’s a decent chance a Democrat will win the presidency next year, at which point he or she will likely abandon Trump’s pro-pollution posture and go back to the auto industry with some thoughts about even more stringent emissions rules.
The industry wants the White House to negotiate some kind of deal with California, with the intention of creating a national standard that everyone can live with. That seems unlikely: Team Trump broke off talks with the Golden State months ago, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has rejected the idea of halfway measures.

"Voting in quasi-militarized settings was not confined to the nation’s capital. In Philadelphia, on election eve, the mayor announced a curfew that was slated to take effect an hour before its polls closed, but subsequently delayed it after an outcry by other city officials and activists. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/we-just-got-a-sneak-peek-of-what-the-november-election-could-look-like/,alternet,elections-2020,left,1.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"More in-person voting sites in metro areas. Better information about where polls have been relocated. More public education about how to vote from home and what to do if an absentee ballot doesn’t arrive—or arrives at the last minute. And no last-minute government decisions that confuse voters and undermine voting, such as imposing curfews before the polls close.
These are some of the takeaways from the nine presidential primaries that took place on June 2, the largest day of voting across America since the pandemic broke in mid-March, where most of the states and the District of Columbia responded by shifting to voting with mailed-out ballots rather than voting centered on local polling places as in previous elections.
The approaches taken in these states and districts varied and reflected the trends seen across the United States. Montana and Maryland mailed ballots to voters. Washington, D.C., and four states sent voters applications to get a mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania and Indiana left it up to voters to apply for an absentee ballot, get the ballots on time, and submit it on time to be counted.
The results were a spectrum of well-run to more-problematic elections. Montana, which is used to voting by mail, had higher turnout than its 2018 fall midterm. But many voters who were not used to voting from home, especially in metro areas, did not get ballots as expected. They went to vote in person, but often found traditional polling places closed. They ended up in long lines and sometimes faced hours-long waits, where social distancing could be challenging, and, in the worst case—in Washington—police were telling voters to go home because of a curfew.
These trends, both better and worse, offer lessons and warning signs for the fall’s elections.
“Overall, this is a dry run for November,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs the nation’s largest Election Day hotline and fielded more than 5,000 calls for the primaries. “We’re bracing for high turnout that we will see in the November general election, and lessons learned from this primary season must guide states… to ensure that every eligible voter can have their voice heard.”
“It is clear that the pandemic is having an impact on virtually every aspect of the voting experience,” she said, noting that impact was apart from a curfew in Washington that was announced by a text alert on Election Day that “did not have an exception making it clear that voters can, indeed, continue to travel to cast their ballot.”
Voting in quasi-militarized settings was not confined to the nation’s capital. In Philadelphia, on election eve, the mayor announced a curfew that was slated to take effect an hour before its polls closed, but subsequently delayed it after an outcry by other city officials and activists. The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism. However, the curfews also come in a climate where the Republican Party, led by President Trump, has been repeatedly making false claims that voting by mail is rife with fraud.
“This is simply not true,” wrote the National Vote at Home Institute’s Amber McReynolds and MIT’s Charles Stewart III, both experts, for the Hill. They noted that the right-wing Heritage Foundation’s oft-cited election fraud database listed 204 cases and 143 convictions using mailed ballots in the past 20 years, where “about 250 million votes have been cast by a mail ballot.” That activity level is “about five times less likely than getting hit by lightning in the United States.”
But while partisan propaganda about voting by mail is only likely to increase as the general election nears, the nuts-and-bolts challenges of shifting to voting by mail in states that have not widely instituted that process is very much a work in progress. In that sense, the statewide and district primaries on June 2, as well as dozens of elections that will be held now through the summer, are microcosms of what is working and what needs to be fixed for the fall.
A Spectrum of States
The June 2 primaries featured jurisdictions with more and less experience running mail-based elections. On the most experienced side, Montana, where the senior statewide election official is a Republican, continued its practice of mailing all voters a ballot. More people voted for its 2020 primary than during the state’s November 2018 midterms.
“Sixty-three percent of active registered voters,” said Phil Keisling, the National Vote at Home Institute’s board chair and former Oregon secretary of state. “That’s higher than 41 states in their midterms in 2018. That’s the power of mailing everyone a ballot.”
While Montana was an example of how voter turnout will increase in states where voters have become used to voting from home, the experience in Midwestern and Eastern states that have not embraced voting from home until the pandemic was rockier was a different story—and not just because of the pandemic’s social distancing requirements or police presence due to widespread protests.
In Pennsylvania’s largest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, Maryland, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, election officials underestimated the number of people who sought to vote in person for any number of reasons: from not getting a mail-in ballot; to getting a ballot late and wanting to drop it off; to simply wanting to vote in a polling place.
While Pennsylvania’s top officials reported a “smooth election amid historic circumstances” as 1.8 million residents applied for an absentee ballot, “17 times greater than the number who applied” in its 2016 presidential primary, voting rights advocates manning election-protection hotlines observed a different experience. The Lawyers’ Committee said that 55 percent of the calls received on June 2 were from Pennsylvania—and from people unable to vote by mail.
Half of the hotline calls concerned finding a polling place, the Committee’s Lacy Crawford said. Another 17 percent concerned ballots—meaning unfamiliarity with mailed-out ballots versus polling place voting. Another 13 percent concerned voter registration. Of slightly less than half of the callers who reported their race, 63 percent were Black, 21 percent were white and 12 percent were Latino.
The takeaway from the committee briefings, where its partners summarized what they were hearing from hundreds of observers, underscored that accommodating the fall’s voters will mean planning for high levels of voting from home—but still significant in-person voting at precincts. That conclusion is what emerges after hearing detailed reports of snafus.
“The big theme of the day is confusion,” said Ivan Garcia, civic engagement director for MakeTheRoadPA.org. “Voters are turning up to their old polling place and not always finding directions to the consolidated poll place that they should be going to. Because of the large number of voters at each poll, poll workers are having trouble finding voters in the poll books—if they even have the poll books. In the worst situations, they are being turned down and turned away so that they cannot vote.”
Garcia also said that many voters had not received a mail-in ballot—even though they said they had applied. When they turned up at vote centers, some poll workers were unfamiliar with the procedures to let them vote. (In some states, poll workers can look up that voter in an electronic poll book and cancel their mail-in ballot, allowing them to vote with a regular ballot. In other states, they must fill out a form to get a provisional ballot.)
“We are seeing voters who requested mail-in ballots who never received them,” he said. “They are turning out to their polling place to vote. And instead of voting provisionally, which is what is supposed to happen, they are being turned away as well. There have been lots of phone calls asking about the clarification about the deadlines for returning mail ballots based on the executive order that Gov. [Tom] Wolf signed yesterday [June 1]. The length of the lines is increasing as we get to the end of the day. There’s been problems in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.”
In Indianapolis, election officials also underestimated the number of in-person voters.
“One thing we learned from our colleagues in Indiana is that even in these challenging circumstances in the Midwest and nationally, voters have really shown a quiet resolve to persevere and to exercise their right to vote today,” said Ami Gandhi, with the committee’s Chicago chapter, which was assisted by Common Cause in Indiana. “The majority of calls we received so far are people needing clarification on where their polling place is… Some voters, especially in Indianapolis, have been facing long lines and congestion… We’re also getting many questions about absentee ballots by voters not comfortable with voting in person.”
These comments reflect that some voters, in response to the pandemic, clearly want to vote from home—one trend that is likely to continue into the fall’s general election. Yet, at the same time, the comments also reflect that many voters who did not get an absentee ballot, for any number of reasons, still wanted to find a way to vote in person. (This was apart from police in some locations, namely Washington, telling voters to leave because of a pending curfew.)
More Takeaways
The June 2 experience had other lessons. In Pennsylvania, where state law does not allow local election officials to start processing mail-in ballots before Election Day and the governor’s order will allow ballots postmarked by June 2 to arrive up to a week later and still be counted, the official results in some contests will not be known for days—which will recur this fall. It’s not known whether the state’s legislature will act to allow counting to start earlier in the fall.
There were other lessons. In Baltimore, where a contractor for the city delivered paper ballots to one district that were not properly printed, that caused a series of cascading problems that will take days to unwind—from voters casting ballots that will not count, to reconciling votes and declaring official outcomes in city races.
That printing error is a warning sign for states or counties that anticipate printing unprecedented volumes of paper ballots in the fall. However, because Maryland is a state offering same-day voter registration, most issues affecting voters could be solved on Election Day at in-person voting sites.
In Washington, one reaction to not getting ballots into voters’ hands was to email voters the ballot—to be printed at their home and then submitted. That response was quickly criticized by cybersecurity advocates, saying it offered a hacking pathway (even though some states have been sending ballots this way to soldiers stationed overseas).
In Philadelphia, there were also reports that the city was ignoring social distancing standards by cramming their new voting machines (one per jurisdiction) into multi-precinct voting locations, which forced voters and poll workers to stand on top of each other. There also were reports from other counties that election officials did not put ballot drop boxes in visible locations.
Stepping back, however, it appeared that apart from Montana’s 63 percent record turnout, a quarter to a third of the registered voters in states that were expanding at-home voting for the first time ended up casting mail-in ballots on June 2, according to the National Vote at Home Institute’s Keisling.
“If we knew how many mailed-out ballots went out, you could apply an 80 percent rule—if 100,000 go out, 80,000 will come back,” he said, adding that not every state will post this information. “It varies a bit, but that’s the general rule, plus or minus 5 percent… All you need to do is look at the total votes [cast] and what’s the difference [subtracting that mail-in ballot estimate]. Those [remaining voters] are the people who showed up at a polling place.”
In other words, looking to the fall, record numbers of voters will be casting mail-in ballots. But sizable numbers of voters will still be looking to vote in person. Election officials will have to adequately prepare for both voting options.

"But one glaring absentee was Trump, who not only declined an invitation but failed to send any American representative at all.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wave-vaccine-nationalism-hinders-global-efforts-halt-coronavirus-n1207846,msnbc,vaccines,left,1.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"LONDON — The coronavirus crosses borders without regard for national boundaries or identities. But the response to it, and the hunt for a vaccine, has been caught up in a tide of nationalism that was already sweeping the world before the virus hit, and may end up delaying distribution of a vaccine to billions of people.
This competitive vision outlined in the United States and other vaccine-producing powerhouses such as China and India threatens to undermine the efforts of dozens of countries, which are raising billions of dollars in an attempt to find an effective immunizing shot that they say should be available equally around the world.
Some experts and former officials fear that leaders such as President Donald Trump may be pursuing the doctrine of ""vaccine nationalism."" This is the idea that any government whose scientists win this vaccine ""race"" — as it's often described — might try to hoard the shots for domestic use.
""Do you believe that Trump's base will be content with a vaccine strategy that does not 'make America great again'?"" asked David Salisbury, a former director of immunization for the British Department of Health who is now an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House. ""If your country develops the vaccine before anyone else, immediately exporting it to another country is not a vote-winner.""
This tension between nationalism and internationalism was illustrated at a virtual summit hosted by the European Union last week.
Dozens of countries, including Canada, Japan, Israel and Saudi Arabia, teamed up with organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in pledging $8 billion toward a global fund for vaccines, treatments and testing.
""This will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,"" the leaders said in a joint statement, committing to making any vaccine ""available, accessible and affordable to all.""
After a pandemic that has fragmented global supply chains, torpedoed world travel and sparked international arguments over exports of medical equipment, it was a rare moment of cross-border cooperation.

But one glaring absentee was Trump, who not only declined an invitation but failed to send any American representative at all.
It was far from the first time Trump has demonstrated his lack of interest in multilateralism. He has openly criticized the founding principles of NATO, branded the E.U. a competitor and slapped its goods with billions of dollars in tariffs, and once told the United Nations General Assembly that ""we reject the ideology of globalism.""
This year he moved to withdraw funding from the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency, after accusing it of helping China cover up the virus in its early stages, an allegation Beijing denies.
'China cannot afford to lose'
China did attend the E.U.-hosted summit, even though Premier Li Keqiang, the country's second-most powerful official, pulled out at the last minute and sent his ambassador to the E.U., Zhang Ming, instead. Some observers perceived this as a snub.
Despite being the world's second-largest economy, China pledged around $49 million, a fraction of what was promised by many of its European counterparts — such as Norway, at $1 billion.

The most promising trial in China is funded by the government. And a far more nationalistic approach was set out in an op-ed article published by the Global Times, the country's hawkish state-run newspaper, which according to its editor publishes what Communist Party officials privately think but don't say publicly.
""We must be aware that the development of a vaccine is a battle that China cannot afford to lose,"" it said. ""There is no way for China to rely on Europe or the U.S. in vaccine development. China has to be by itself in this crucial field,"" it added, calling the race ""a life-and-death battle.""
Another absentee at the summit was India, which is home to the world's largest vaccine producer by volume, the Serum Institute of India. Its owner, the billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, has openly said that ""a majority of the vaccine, at least initially, would have to go to our countrymen before it goes abroad.""

Even for those countries that did attend, it is not clear whether they would have the power to enforce their egalitarian vision in the face of nationalistic or market forces.
French President Emmanuel Macron said that any vaccine ""won't belong to anybody,"" and that those who discover it ""will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe.""
This dream was given a reality check Wednesday after Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical giant and one of the leading players in the coronavirus vaccine race, told Bloomberg News that the U.S. was likely to get access before the rest of the world because it had invested more money.
Likewise in the U.K. — which pledged more than $480 million at the teleconference — the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said it ""will prioritize the U.K."" if its promising trial yields results.
""This debate builds on a long-standing question about nationalism versus global responsibility,"" said Nancy Kass, a professor and the deputy director for public health at Johns Hopkins University's Berman Institute of Bioethics. ""And we happen to be in an extraordinarily nationalistic period right now in the United States.""
Like many bioethicists, Kass said it's understandable for citizens to expect first access to drugs developed and manufactured on their soil, particularly at a time of chronic anxiety.
""I don't think it will either be constructive or even necessarily an appropriate framing to think of this in terms of good guys and bad guys,"" she said. ""What I do think is essential is that people use this time before we have a vaccine to have this conversation.""
'Incalculable' value
There's no guarantee an effective vaccine will ever be found, and even then it could take a year or more to develop, test and distribute. Worldwide, about a dozen vaccine candidates are in the first stages of testing or poised to begin, small safety studies in people, according to the Associated Press.
""The social value of a safe and effective vaccine is almost incalculable — we are talking about trillions of dollars,"" said Frank Lichtenberg, a Columbia Business School professor who has spent much of his career estimating how much new medicines are worth.
""Drugs are usually valuable because they decrease mortality,"" he said, ""not because they have the power to stop the unemployment rate hitting 20 percent, like this one might.""
Trump has labeled his vaccine effort ""Operation Warp Speed,"" spending hundreds of millions of dollars co-funding efforts by companies such as the Boston-based Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, based in New Jersey.
Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky has said his company is committed to coming up with a not-for-profit vaccine that is ""available and affordable globally as quickly as possible.""

And even Trump himself said in March that ""I don't care"" when asked if he worried about another country beating the U.S. in the inoculation race.
""I just want to get a vaccine that works. If it’s another country, I’ll take my hat off to them,"" he said, ""We’re working with other countries, we're working with Australia, we’re working with the U.K.""
But the Department of Health and Human Services was clear in a statement March 30 that domestic use would take priority, and that the initial goal was to make a ""COVID-19 vaccine available for emergency use in the United States in early 2021.""
The vaccine world has been here before. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries put in advanced orders for the H1N1 flu vaccine, essentially crowding out poorer countries who had to wait longer to get access to the shots.

However, in this unprecedented situation, where a vaccine could prevent a country's economic collapse, governments might resort to more desperate measures. One tactic might be to ignore patents covering the drugs and manufacture them without consent, according to Søren Holm, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester, in England.
That's what South Africa did with HIV/AIDS medicine in the 1990s, ultimately forcing drug companies into a humiliating climbdown in which they licensed the medication at a lower price.
""It showed that these types of threats tend to work,"" Holm said.
Ultimately, whoever wins the race, the U.S. is unlikely to find itself shut out.
""If the vaccine is discovered somewhere else, then I'm sure that the U.S. will tell that pharmaceutical firm that they have to sell to them as well,"" Holm added. ""The U.S. is by far the most important market for any large pharmaceutical firm, so it would be commercial suicide for any firm to tell America they have to wait.""",['glaring']

For professional athletes whose bodies are their businesses, health is a top priority. As the epidemic spreads, more and more athletes are forced to weigh a potential threat against the financial loss of missing a competition.
“You’re going to get a lot of different answers,” said Chris Layne, managing director of Total Sports US, which represents some of the world’s top track and field athletes. “If you have an athlete at the pinnacle of their career, both in earnings and performance, maybe they can afford to miss an event versus someone fighting to get to that point.”
Track and field athletes don’t typically earn the lucrative salaries seen in the NBA, NFL, tennis or international soccer. The biggest shot for these athletes to make money lies in prizes and sponsorship deals. To earn either, you have to participate in events. That makes the impact of a missed event more significant, according to Layne.
“If you do six events and say you earn $500, that $3,000 lets you keep performing,” he said. “Track and field is really a global sport in terms of events so it could snowball with an athlete losing six, seven, eight times to compete and make a name for themselves. You could be taking away a season’s worth of earning potential.”
One of the bigger sponsorship opportunities for track and field athletes lies in the Olympics, which provide nearly unparalleled exposure. But if coronavirus continues to be a threat, the decision about whether to risk competing could be out of athletes’ hands.
Dick Pound, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee, said a decision about whether to proceed with holding the event would need to be made by late May. If the coronavirus isn’t contained by that point, Pound said cancellation could be a possibility.
For now, the IOC isn’t planning to cancel the Games, which have dealt with potential health threats in the recent past. There were concerns about bird flu ahead of the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, Zika during the 2016 Rio Olympics, and swine flu before the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.",['lucrative']

A Catholic priest in Rhode Island who barred state lawmakers who supported an abortion rights bill from receiving communion at his church has doubled down on his stance, saying abortion is worse than pedophilia.
In an interview over the weekend with NBC affiliate WJAR in Providence, the Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick described abortion as ""the slaughter of innocent children.""
""We are not talking about any other moral issue, where some may make it a comparison between pedophilia and abortion,"" Bucci told the station. ""Pedophilia doesn't kill anyone, and this does.""
Bucci said more children have been killed by abortion than have been abused, adding, ""which is not to say that abuse is not a horrible thing.""
Sacred Heart Church declined to comment Wednesday, deferring to Bucci. NBC News reached out to Bucci for comment but did not immediately hear back. He later told WJAR his comments were taken out of context and that if anyone supports clergy sex abuse victims, it's him.
""It was imperfectly said,"" Bucci said. ""I should have said, 'In general, the child that's molested does not die physically,' and I should have said, 'but some have.'""

Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick, R.I. WJAR
Bucci's earlier comments to the TV station came after he put out a notice to Sacred Heart parishioners at the end of January listing the names of lawmakers who would not be allowed to receive communion at the church or participate in certain religious functions, such as acting as godparents or lectors at weddings.
The announcement came days after the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 establishing the right to abortion.
The priest's action also came months after Rhode Island in 2019 enacted the Reproductive Privacy Act to enshrine the right to abortion in state law.
The secretary of Sacred Heart Church provided a copy of the flyer to NBC News. Lawmakers' names appeared below the message:
""In accord with the teaching of the Catholic Church for 2000 years, the following members of the legislature may not receive Holy Communion, as are all the officers of the state of Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island’s members of Congress. In addition, they will not be allowed to act as witnesses to marriage, godparents, or lectors at weddings, funerals or any other church function.”
Bucci discussed this announcement in an interview with the Providence Journal.
“If they are proud of what they have done, why do they want to keep it a secret?"" he said of lawmakers. ""We all hear about responsibility. Let them take responsibility. If they think this is a good and wholesome and holy thing ... they should be proud of it, and why should I hide that from my parishioners?""
Providence Bishop Thomas Tobin issued a statement Thursday, saying, ""It is never acceptable to underestimate the harm caused by sexual abuse of minors,"" but ""abortion is also a sinful, immoral act, an abominable crime.”
""In the current public discussion, I urge all parties to refrain from unhelpful, inflammatory rhetoric, and to reflect personally and prayerfully on the consequences of these grave matters,"" Tobin said.
On Monday, a diocese spokeswoman, Carolyn Cronin, told WJAR that the church provides ""detailed norms for preparation and reception"" for each sacrament, but that it is ""the pastor’s duty to apply them within his parish, in accord with church law.""
""Because the church entrusts to each pastor the duty of teaching, sanctifying, and governing his parish, the daily pastoral and administrative decisions are made at the local parish level,"" Cronin said.","['abortion', 'worse', 'than', 'pedophilia']"
Gwyneth Paltrow’s anti-vaxxer ally comes under fire for ‘discredited pseudo-scientific claims’ about coronavirus,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/gwyneth-paltrows-anti-vaxxer-ally-comes-under-fire-for-discredited-pseudo-scientific-claims-about-coronavirus/,alternet,vaccines,left,2.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The internet has been a frequent source of high-quality reporting on the coronavirus pandemic, from the New York Times and the Washington Post to MSNBC and CNN to Axios. But some questionable claims about COVID-19 have also appeared online, and the Daily Beast’s Dean Sterling Jones notes that some of them have come from the controversial psychiatrist Kelly Brogan — known for her association with actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
According to Jones, Brogan (an anti-vaxxer) has been “spreading discredited pseudo-scientific claims that the coronavirus might not even exist” and that “symptoms attributed to the virus are likely being caused by widespread fear.” Brogan’s assertions, Jones notes, can be found in a video recently posted on Facebook and Instagram.
Jones explains, “In the video, which was originally shared with paid subscribers of Brogan’s ‘health reclamation’ program, Vital Life Project, and has since been viewed over 75,000 times online, Brogan claimed that ‘there is potentially no such thing as the coronavirus’ because ‘it’s not possible to prove that any given pathogen has induced death,’ and that the rising death toll caused by the virus is ‘likely being accelerated by the fear (of the virus) itself.’”
Jones noted that Facebook removed Brogan’s video following inquiries from the Daily Beast, and a Facebook spokesperson told the publication, “These videos violate our policies and have been removed from both Facebook and Instagram.”
When the Beast contacted Goop, Jones reports, Paltrow’s company declined to comment and stated, “We would suggest reaching out to Dr. Brogan directly, as she didn’t make those comments on Goop’s platform.” And when the Beast contacted Brogan, she didn’t respond.
Brogan has received widespread criticism in recent years for her comments against vaccination, including her claim that vaccines are linked to autism.","['pseudo-scientific', 'anti-vaxxer', 'discredited']"
That’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.”,https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/anti-vaxxers-are-latching-onto-the-coronavirus-pandemic-to-bolster-their-movement/,alternet,vaccines,left,2.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"While most of the world hungers for a vaccine to put an end to the death and economic destruction wrought by COVID-19, some anti-vaccine groups are joining with anti-lockdown protesters to challenge restrictions aimed at protecting public health.
Vaccine critics suffered serious setbacks in the past year, as states strengthened immunization laws in response to measles outbreaks sparked by vaccine refusers. California tightened its vaccine requirements last fall despite protests during which anti-vaccine activists threw blood on state senators, assaulted the vaccine bill’s sponsor and shut down the legislature.
Now, many of these same vaccine critics are joining a fight against stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which had killed more than 47,000 Americans as of Thursday afternoon.
“This is just a fresh coat of paint for the anti-vaccine movement in America, and an exploitative means for them to try to remain relevant,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Hotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.
“Unfortunately, their strategy may work.”
A group calling itself the Freedom Angels, whose members last year stood on chairs and chanted at public hearings on the California vaccine bill, say governors are abusing their power by shutting down gun shops and other businesses.
Many anti-vaccine activists — who have claimed that diseases such as measles aren’t that serious — now contend the coronavirus isn’t dangerous enough to justify staying home. They agree with President Donald Trump that the “cure” for the pandemic could be worse than the disease itself.
That’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.”
“This is the time for people to take notice and really evaluate the freedoms they’re giving up, all in the name of perceived safety,” said Freedom Angels co-founder Heidi Munoz Gleisner in a Facebook video.
The group organized a Monday rally in Sacramento called “Operation Gridlock.”
“People need to get back to work, get back to life, get back into contact with their loved ones who they’re isolated from, they need to be able to have a paycheck,” group co-founder Tara Thornton told The Sacramento Bee, which interviewed her during the demonstration. “This is the grounds they will enslave us upon.”
Freedom Angels did not respond to requests for interviews. The group’s website mentions plans for additional rallies and includes photos from Monday’s demonstration, such as one in which a protester holds a sign proclaiming “No Mandatory Vaccines.”
But after the Monday event, the California Highway Patrol announced it had revoked the group’s permit for future protests because the gathering — which included dozens of people — violated the governor’s social distancing order. The highway patrol has now banned all group events at the Capitol during the pandemic to avoid spreading the coronavirus.
A big tent
The anti-vaccine movement has never been limited to one political party. Left-leaning vaccine critics — such as Children’s Health Defense, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — include environmentalists who are suspicious of chemical pollutants, corporations and “Big Pharma.” The Kennedy group’s website attacks Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for rushing “risky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines” into development as part of a “sweetheart deal” for drug companies.
On the other side of the political spectrum, many anti-vaccine conservatives oppose state immunization requirements because they distrust “big government.”
A group called Texans for Vaccine Choice has called on the governor to promise that no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine in order to go to work or school.
Posts on the Facebook page of Californians for Health Choice, which also opposed California’s vaccine laws, question stay-at-home orders and accuse government officials of refusing to admit the orders are a mistake.
In a video on the Freedom Angels’ Facebook page, its founders describe stay-at-home orders as an abuse of government authority, and the closure of California gun shops as an assault on the Second Amendment. The group notes that guns could be essential for protection from rioters and looters looking to steal food during the pandemic.
In many ways, the conservative arm of the anti-vaccine movement is a natural ally for those leading “reopen America” rallies, said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the Science-Based Medicine site. Both harbor suspicions about government authority.
Vaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. Trump has at times linked vaccines with autism, although he came out strongly in favor of vaccinations during the 2019 measles epidemic.
Anti-vaccine groups are now rebranding themselves as advocates of “medical freedom.”
Protests against social distancing began in Michigan but have spread to state capitols in Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere, with more planned. Most protests have been small, limited to a few hundred or fewer people.
Yet the anti-vaccine movement doesn’t speak for everyone on the right.
Stephen Moore, the senior economic contributor for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group that has been helping publicize the protests, said he’s unfamiliar with the Freedom Angels or their rallies.
“I’m personally pro-vaccine,” said Moore, a member of the White House council to reopen the economy. “Especially when it comes to coronavirus.”
And some heroes of the anti-vaccine movement say they support coronavirus lockdowns.
Dr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica, California, pediatrician popular among vaccine foes for downplaying the risks of measles, said the risk of COVID-19 is real. Gordon said he approves of the lockdown, “and we have to keep it up.”
Containing the pandemic
Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and California state senator who has championed stronger vaccine mandates, described anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters as “essentially selfish” because they put other people at risk.
“One of the hallmarks of the anti-vaccine movement is this sense of selfishness and lack of concern for other people’s health,” Pan said. “They like to talk about rights and freedom. But what they really want is freedom without consequences.”
Both anti-vaccine parents and those who want to relax social distancing assume that the medical system will come to their rescue if they become sick, said Pan, who noted that thousands of health care workers have died while fighting the pandemic.
Fauci has said that relaxing stay-at-home orders is dangerous as long as the virus — for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines — is actively spreading. Reopening businesses too soon could spark a second wave of infections.
More than 75 companies and research groups worldwide are trying to develop vaccines, which are seen as a key weapon against the novel coronavirus.
In the meantime, the CDC says that social distancing measures — such as working from home and avoiding large gatherings — are critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing patients from overwhelming hospitals. Health leaders say it won’t be safe to reopen the county until widespread testing shows the coronavirus has died down.
Americans overwhelmingly support vaccination, according to surveys, and polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 80% of Americans want lockdowns to continue. Only 19% said social distancing orders placed an unnecessary burden on the economy. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
Neither the anti-vaccine nor anti-lockdown demonstrators represent the opinions of most Americans, Pan said.
“Let’s put this movement into proper context,” he said. “They’re loud, they’re noisy and they’re small.”","['foes', 'encouraged']"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
EL CINCHADO, Guatemala — Less-organized migrants, tighter immigration control by Guatemalan authorities and the presence of U.S. advisers have reduced the likelihood that the hundreds of migrants who departed Honduras will form anything like the cohesive procession the term “caravan” now conjures.
What awaits them along their journey has changed dramatically. Guatemalan officials are checking documents, Mexico's National Guard has been deployed and if the migrants make it to the U.S. border, officials there will make them await their asylum cases in Mexico or send them to another country in the region they're fleeing to apply for protection there.
The migrants who set out from a bus terminal in the northern Honduras city of San Pedro Sula early Wednesday quickly dispersed depending on their luck catching rides and the border crossing they were targeting.
For days, a rallying call for a new caravan circulated on social media. But the turnout, while large, did not compare to caravans of 2018 that drew the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Caravans have tended to attract migrants with fewer resources — not enough money to pay a smuggler — and offer a greater level of security than traveling alone or in small groups.
Migrants interviewed said they knew of no plan to regroup along the way and form a caravan. Most were clustered along highways walking in groups of 20 or so.

Walter Martínez joined those assembled in San Pedro Sula because he figured it would be safer to travel with others. When he migrated the first time five years ago, his family paid for a smuggler. The now 18-year-old lived in Houston until he was deported in November.
Returning to Honduras gave him a chance to see his mother for the first time in years, but he found he knew almost no one else. He had been traveling all day Wednesday with a single mother and her baby who he met in San Pedro Sula. They were spending the night at a small shelter in Entre Rios about 15 miles into Guatemala.
“I didn't tell my little brothers because I was afraid of failing,” Martínez said. “The only thing motivating me is seeing my family.”
Farther along toward the Guatemalan capital, in the town of Morales, National Police were checking migrants' documents at a roadblock. Associated Press journalists saw about 20 Honduran migrants being put onto a police vehicle to be driven back to the border because they had not registered with immigration officials there.
Guatemalan police officers were accompanied at the checkpoint by four agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Since about May, Homeland Security has deployed dozens of agents and investigators to Guatemala to work as ""advisers"" to the national police there and migration officials. They are also trying to disrupt human smuggling operations.
The move was an initial step in the agreement with Guatemala to send asylum-seekers there, and was part of an overall plan by DHS to help strengthen the country's border security in an effort to stem the flow of migrants crossing into the U.S.

Officials have not given specifics on how many DHS personnel were on the ground for security reasons. It was an effort brokered by Kevin McAleenan, the former acting head of DHS.
Simultaneously, the U.S. government was pressuring Mexico to act. In late May, Trump threatened tariffs on all Mexican imports that would have been devastating. Mexico avoided them by agreeing to the expansion of the U.S. program known as “Remain in Mexico” that has led to more than 55,000 asylum seekers waiting out their cases in Mexico and to the deployment of a portion of its newly created National Guard to help stop migrants making their way through the country.
On Wednesday, Guatemala's new President Alejandro Giammattei said Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard told him Mexico will not let a migrant caravan pass. Mexico Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez Cordero warned of special operations and immigration agents.
Some migrants said they were aware that getting to the United States would be tough, but said they would try anyway.
“We aren't living here, we're just surviving,"" said Elmer Garcia, 26, a migrant from the town of Comayagua who set out from San Pedro Sula. ""So it doesn't make much difference if you die there, or die here.”

"Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-brutalizing-protesters-would-save-him-he-was-wrong/,alternet,elections-2020,left,2.0,3.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['brutality', 'encourages', 'excites']"

The Trump administration has continued to deny climate change findings and make scientific reports inaccessible to the public. Nye counters EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s claim that the threat of climate change is “50 to 75 years out.” “It’s not 50 to 75 years away — it’s 10 or 15,” Nye said.

Nye pulled out a hockey stick graph that he said climate change deniers like to wave around to help show how climate change has been debunked, but he illustrated that it wasn’t. Nye used a simplified calculus formula to show the rate of change in temperature over time.
“The rate of temperature getting bigger is very high… There is enough carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere already to make the world get warmer for many decades to come,” Nye said. “What we want is to slow that rate.”
Nye also laid out what he thinks the three priorities should be: Access to clean water, access to the internet and information, and all energy coming from renewable sources. “We can do this!” Nye said enthusiastically.

"In the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective and unnecessary border wall.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/part-wall-crusade-pence-turns-mlks-i-have-dream-speech,msnbc,immigration,left,3.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"When Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech nearly 56 years ago, it came against a backdrop of significant societal tumult, including the assassination of Medgar Evers just two months earlier. The civil rights leader’s remarks spoke to the sense of urgency.
“This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism,” MLK said in his remarks. “Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.”
Vice President Mike Pence apparently felt justified appropriating King’s rhetoric into the White House’s immigration agenda, arguing on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” yesterday:
“You know, the hearts and minds of the American people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend where we remember the life and work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. One of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, ‘Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.’ “You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. That’s exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do. Come to the table in a spirit of good faith.”
Of course, the last time congressional Democratic leaders went to the negotiating table “in a spirit of good faith,” Donald Trump walked away from the table after being told he couldn’t have what he thinks he’s entitled to.
But even putting aside the relevant details, Pence’s use of King’s quote is hopelessly misguided. For one thing, given everything we know about King’s record, it’s simply implausible to think the iconic leader would have endorsed a far-right campaign intended to demonize and punish immigrants. Indeed, the NAACP called Pence’s comments “an insult” to King’s legacy.
For another, if we’re going to make real the promises of democracy, we’re going to have to reject Team Trump’s misguided wall crusade.
Trump ran on a platform of building a wall with Mexican money, and on Election Day 2016, more Americans voted for his opponent. The Republican president proceeded to pitch an aggressively anti-immigrant message ahead of Election Day 2018, when voters handed Democrats control of the House.
In the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective and unnecessary border wall.
It’s against this backdrop that the president wants to short circuit the American policymaking process – which is supposed to involve introducing an idea, sending it to committee, allowing for congressional debate and amendments, holding a series of legislative votes, etc. – and instead have his demands met through an extortion strategy built around holding the government hostage.
If Mike Pence thinks Trump’s demands for a border wall have anything to do with “the promises of democracy,” he’s looking at reality through a rather twisted lens. To take democracy seriously is to do the opposite of what the president commands.","['ineffective', 'unnecessary']"
"Yet when researchers in the U.S. have been so corrupt they have gone to jail, mainstream scientists still accept their research.",https://www.alternet.org/2017/01/big-pharma-anti-vaccines/,alternet,vaccines,left,3.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Why do progressive news sites that expose government and corporate disinformation in other areas accept disinformation when it comes to vaccines–actually calling activists “unscientific”?
It is not surprising mainstream scientists are vaccine absolutists who vilify “anti-vaxxers” given that their medical centers, hospital wings, universities and sometimes personal paychecks are funded by Pharma. (The motive of progressive sites is less clear.) But “Pharma knows best” rings false with a quick look at withdrawn drugs like Vioxx, Bextra, Baycol, Trovan, Meridia, Darvon, Phen-Fen, Raxar and Seldane–all called safe when they were making millions.
Neither mainstream nor progressive news sites want to acknowledge the existence of the federal National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) which, since 1988, has settled more than 16,000 claims and awarded $3.18 billion in injury settlements. When I asked a vaccine expert why the court existed if vaccines are unremittingly safe he told me that vaccines are so basic to public health yet so non-lucrative (compared to billion dollar pills), the government does not want vaccine makers bankrupted by lawsuits.
But ignoring the court and the ghastly injuries it settles—I was told, off the record, about a woman who lost her fingers and toes from vasculitis caused by a vaccine—mainstream scientists are the ones who are “unscientific.” The truth is not all vaccines are safe, life-saving or necessary and conflicts of interest do exist. Consider the case of Gardasil, a vaccine against the human papillomavirus vaccine types 6, 11, 16, 18.
The Case of Gardasil
A few years ago, Merck aggressively marketed Gardasil, a vaccine against the HPV virus (which is linked to venereal warts and cervical cancer)–even in poor countries where cervical cancer is hardly a leading cause of death compared to malaria or diarrheal diseases. (In developed countries, a Pap test is as effective as a vaccine in preventing cervical cancer.)
Last year, judges in India’s Supreme Court demanded answers after children died during a trial of Gardasil and Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline’s counterpart vaccine, a few years earlier.
According to CBS News there was another cloud over Gardasil. “Merck gave $6,000 to [Texas Gov. Rick] Perry’s election campaign fund as part of a national lobbying effort to persuade states that it ought to require Gardasil as one of the vaccines all kids should have before attending school,” it wrote. The director of a Merck-funded pro-Gardasil group was also Perry’s then-chief of staff’s mother-in-law.
Nor did the departure of former CDC director Julie Gerberding to head Merck’s vaccines division look right to many ethics specialists.
Docs Gone Bad
Mainstream scientists have savaged Andrew Wakefield, a British medical researcher found to have conducted fraudulent research linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. His corruption is said to disprove any scientific doubts about vaccine safety.
Yet when researchers in the U.S. have been so corrupt they have gone to jail, mainstream scientists still accept their research. Scott Reuben published fraudulent research on Lyrica, Effexor, Celebrex and other drugs for Pharma. He went to prison for six months but the “science” behind the drugs he promoted stands. Richard Borison, former psychiatry chief at Augusta Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center and Medical College of Georgia, went to prison for 15 years for using clinical trials on veterans of the antipsychotic Seroquel to line his own pockets. The drug went on to earn billions and his for-profit “research” still stands.
As a reporter I have interviewed a man whose blindness was caused by a 1976 flu vaccine for which the government compensated him. More recently I interviewed a parent whose normal toddler was never the same after a vaccine and is now institutionalized. “He cried hysterically for 24 hours,” the parent, who is a medical practitioner, told me.
Pharma is unwise to cast such parents, of whom there are many, as “nuts.” The degeneration of their child is not their imagination. Also, there is no defensible reason for vaccines to be given all at once to a child, which many say heightens risks. Administering clusters of vaccines–once not given to children–has been called a major, new profit center for pediatricians.
But anti-vaccination activists should also not be absolutist. Would anyone refuse a rabies vaccine after being bitten by a rabid raccoon? A tetanus shot after a serious wound? Would responsible parents deny their child a whooping cough or polio vaccine?
Like all drugs aggressively marketed these days, patients and parents need to do their own research and weigh benefits and risks—never forgetting Pharma’s spotty safety record.","['corrupt', 'mainstream']"
"Democrats really don’t want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a giant, ineffective border wall, so if Trump were try to come up with an offer designed to entice them, he’d have to propose something that would be (a) enormous; and (b) wildly unpopular among Republicans.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/what-trump-prepared-offer-exchange-border-wall,msnbc,immigration,left,3.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"One need not be an expert in negotiations to understand the basic elements of a deal. At its core, one side tells another, “I’ll give you x, if you give me y.” If the parties agree to the terms, an agreement is reached, and the transaction goes forward.
In the dominant political fight in D.C., Donald Trump wants a giant wall along the U.S./Mexico border. In order to reach his goal, the Republican president is prepared to offer congressional Democrats … nothing. The purported author of the ghost-written “Art of the Deal” – a man who routinely pretends to be a world-class authority on negotiations – is trying to reach an agreement in which his White House makes no concessions.
Trump simply wants Democratic lawmakers to give him more than $5 billion for a vanity project – as if he’s entitled to it. The wall should be a reward for how awesome the president’s awesomeness is. For some reason, this hasn’t worked.
Of course, Trump could try a more conventional approach to negotiating, in which he offered something tangible that Democrats want in exchange for what he wants. In fact, some on the right are concerned the president may eventually do exactly that. The New York Times published a quote the other day that stood out for me:
“I’ve always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall – I think that’s still a potential danger,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that argues for less immigration. “I’m still worried about that now.”
From a conservative perspective, those concerns are well grounded. Democrats really don’t want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a giant, ineffective border wall, so if Trump were try to come up with an offer designed to entice them, he’d have to propose something that would be (a) enormous; and (b) wildly unpopular among Republicans.
And this got me thinking: what exactly would it take? What would a borderline-desperate president put on the table to sway Democrats?
As of yesterday, the White House’s position was plainly absurd: if Democrats agreed to finance a border wall, Trump would end the shutdown. Since the government has to re-open anyway, and that’s a priority for both parties, it obviously can’t be the basis for a credible deal.
Similarly, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) suggested the president offer a debt-ceiling increase and higher domestic spending caps. Of course, raising the debt limit falls into the same category as re-opening government – it’s a bipartisan priority that has to happen – though higher domestic spending caps is at least a step in the right direction.
I’ve seen some talk about offering DACA protections to Dreamers in exchange for a wall, but Trump has already rejected this offer in the recent past, and besides, at least for now, those DACA protections already exist.
It’s why Republicans will have to think much bigger. What if Trump offered some combination of a universal background check system on gun purchases, dramatically expanded voting rights, and new health care protections? Would Dems be tempted to write a check for the border?
I don’t know. Maybe the president should try it and see what happens.",['ineffective']

The Trump Administration hasn’t built a single foot of border fencing after thirty months of riling up its supporters with claims that the wall was vital to national security.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/private-gofundme-border-wall-effort-now-under-criminal-investigation/,alternet,immigration,left,4.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Kolfage’s wall charity has erected a half-mile segment of fencing on what it says is private land in the town of Sunland Park, N.M. That work stopped temporarily when city officials determined that the project violated local zoning laws.
Mayor Receives Death Threats
After being told to stop work, WeBuildTheWall used its social media accounts to bully local officials. Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea said he got death threats .
Wall construction resumed after George Cudahy, the landowner, told city officials he just wanted it put up some lights and poles. The city acquiesced with his request.
But when city officials realized the wall project had resumed they filed a criminal complaint. Cudahy failed to appear in local court for a hearing on the complaint, which could result in a criminal record and a $500 fine.
The project also includes an encroachment on federal land. The International Boundary and Water Commission ordered Kolfage’s charity to act, but nothing happened.
The commission said in a statement that WeBuildTheWall “built a gate on federal land in Sunland Park, N.M., near El Paso, Texas, without authority, and then locked the gate closed on June 6, 2019. The private gate blocks a levee road owned by the U.S. Government. After repeated requests to unlock and open the private gate, the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), accompanied by two uniformed law enforcement officers from the Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office, removed the private lock, opened the gate, and locked the gate open pending further discussions with We Build the Wall.”
Part of the Wall in Mexico
The Mexican government says the wall, or at least part of it, is on Mexican soil.
Surveyors sent by the Mexican government determined that part of the fence construction sits on the wrong side of the border. Mexican officials said the encroaching materials will have to be removed, which may prove difficult to accomplish.
The Trump Administration hasn’t built a single foot of border fencing after thirty months of riling up its supporters with claims that the wall was vital to national security.
The latest estimate is that the proposed Mexico border wall would cost nearly $60 billion. That is 3,000 times as much money as the charity said it has raised.
A wall cannot be built along signification sections of the border with Mexico because of terrain issues, according to federal agencies and others who have studied Trump’s idea.
Trump, who ran for office saying Mexico would pay for the wall, failed to get any money from Congress in his first two years in office, when Republicans controlled both chambers. Democrats, who now control the House, say they will never fund Trump’s wall.
The Washington Post reported that Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) held up one of Trump’s appointees for a post that requires Senate confirmation to encourage the Army Corps of Engineers to hire Fisher Industries to build Trump’s unfunded Mexican border wall.
Fisher Industries, a North Dakota-based company, built the half-mile fencing for Kolfage’s wall charity. It’s unknown if WeBuildTheWall has anything to do with the senator’s efforts.
Kobach’s Role
The organization’s general counsel is Kris Kobach, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Kansas who also sits on the wall charity’s board as a director. As Kansas secretary of state, Kobach pushed to remove 20,000 voters from the election rolls, sought strict voter identification requirements and government registration of Muslims. Trump considered naming him his “immigration czar.”","['riling', 'single', 'up']"
"To bolster the argument that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/how-the-religious-rights-war-against-abortion-is-built-on-lies-grifting-and-bullying/,alternet,abortion,left,5.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"On Tuesday, both the pro- and anti-choice world were rocked by a revelation that undermines literal decades of religious right nonsense. Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous “conversion” to anti-abortion activism was a con job.
McCorvey told filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, “AKA Jane Roe,” “I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
For pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey’s “conversion” as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don’t want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless “abortion industry.”
McCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was “saved” by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can’t be trusted with autonomy, and need “godly” men to guide them.
(Benham, a supposedly wise and “pro-life” guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among the protesters, clinic staff and the pregnant people seeking care.)
Having spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey’s “conversion” was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped, even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn’t try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn’t seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.
So yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers — nearly half a million dollars over the years — sounds about right.
But the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn’t about McCorvey’s character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire raison d’être is telling lies — often over-the-top, melodramatic lies — in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the “right” of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.
The anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become one big, long con.
The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.
For instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)
To bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice “testimony” is all to often as McCorvey described it: “[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
But this “born alive” mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump’s weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.
The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.
A series of “undercover” videos purporting to “prove” that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling “baby parts” out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would turn out to be bullshit, but too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.
Sure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn’t sell baby parts.” They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research — research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.
This myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest buffer zone around clinics by claiming they were merely “sidewalk counselors” trying to “help” women.
An investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They’re a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.
“If women want careers and education and everything and they don’t want children,” one protester complained to Filipovic, “what are they doing having sex?”
Another complained that “there were no problems” back when women “had to be obedient to their husbands.”
Instead of contraception, a protester argued, “the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”
The court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters merely wished to “counsel” women.
Anti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they’re righteous warriors going up against a sleazy “abortion industry” and trying to “save” women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.
In truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them of their rights and subjugate them both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stands with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny and lurid fantasy.
The press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie will help open up some eyes.
But it’s also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don’t want or can’t bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It’s a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.","['trots', 'anti-choice', 'survived']"
"Vaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/anti-vaxxers-are-latching-onto-the-coronavirus-pandemic-to-bolster-their-movement/,alternet,vaccines,left,5.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"While most of the world hungers for a vaccine to put an end to the death and economic destruction wrought by COVID-19, some anti-vaccine groups are joining with anti-lockdown protesters to challenge restrictions aimed at protecting public health.
Vaccine critics suffered serious setbacks in the past year, as states strengthened immunization laws in response to measles outbreaks sparked by vaccine refusers. California tightened its vaccine requirements last fall despite protests during which anti-vaccine activists threw blood on state senators, assaulted the vaccine bill’s sponsor and shut down the legislature.
Now, many of these same vaccine critics are joining a fight against stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which had killed more than 47,000 Americans as of Thursday afternoon.
“This is just a fresh coat of paint for the anti-vaccine movement in America, and an exploitative means for them to try to remain relevant,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Hotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.
“Unfortunately, their strategy may work.”
A group calling itself the Freedom Angels, whose members last year stood on chairs and chanted at public hearings on the California vaccine bill, say governors are abusing their power by shutting down gun shops and other businesses.
Many anti-vaccine activists — who have claimed that diseases such as measles aren’t that serious — now contend the coronavirus isn’t dangerous enough to justify staying home. They agree with President Donald Trump that the “cure” for the pandemic could be worse than the disease itself.
That’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.”
“This is the time for people to take notice and really evaluate the freedoms they’re giving up, all in the name of perceived safety,” said Freedom Angels co-founder Heidi Munoz Gleisner in a Facebook video.
The group organized a Monday rally in Sacramento called “Operation Gridlock.”
“People need to get back to work, get back to life, get back into contact with their loved ones who they’re isolated from, they need to be able to have a paycheck,” group co-founder Tara Thornton told The Sacramento Bee, which interviewed her during the demonstration. “This is the grounds they will enslave us upon.”
Freedom Angels did not respond to requests for interviews. The group’s website mentions plans for additional rallies and includes photos from Monday’s demonstration, such as one in which a protester holds a sign proclaiming “No Mandatory Vaccines.”
But after the Monday event, the California Highway Patrol announced it had revoked the group’s permit for future protests because the gathering — which included dozens of people — violated the governor’s social distancing order. The highway patrol has now banned all group events at the Capitol during the pandemic to avoid spreading the coronavirus.
A big tent
The anti-vaccine movement has never been limited to one political party. Left-leaning vaccine critics — such as Children’s Health Defense, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — include environmentalists who are suspicious of chemical pollutants, corporations and “Big Pharma.” The Kennedy group’s website attacks Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for rushing “risky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines” into development as part of a “sweetheart deal” for drug companies.
On the other side of the political spectrum, many anti-vaccine conservatives oppose state immunization requirements because they distrust “big government.”
A group called Texans for Vaccine Choice has called on the governor to promise that no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine in order to go to work or school.
Posts on the Facebook page of Californians for Health Choice, which also opposed California’s vaccine laws, question stay-at-home orders and accuse government officials of refusing to admit the orders are a mistake.
In a video on the Freedom Angels’ Facebook page, its founders describe stay-at-home orders as an abuse of government authority, and the closure of California gun shops as an assault on the Second Amendment. The group notes that guns could be essential for protection from rioters and looters looking to steal food during the pandemic.
In many ways, the conservative arm of the anti-vaccine movement is a natural ally for those leading “reopen America” rallies, said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the Science-Based Medicine site. Both harbor suspicions about government authority.
Vaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. Trump has at times linked vaccines with autism, although he came out strongly in favor of vaccinations during the 2019 measles epidemic.
Anti-vaccine groups are now rebranding themselves as advocates of “medical freedom.”
Protests against social distancing began in Michigan but have spread to state capitols in Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere, with more planned. Most protests have been small, limited to a few hundred or fewer people.
Yet the anti-vaccine movement doesn’t speak for everyone on the right.
Stephen Moore, the senior economic contributor for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group that has been helping publicize the protests, said he’s unfamiliar with the Freedom Angels or their rallies.
“I’m personally pro-vaccine,” said Moore, a member of the White House council to reopen the economy. “Especially when it comes to coronavirus.”
And some heroes of the anti-vaccine movement say they support coronavirus lockdowns.
Dr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica, California, pediatrician popular among vaccine foes for downplaying the risks of measles, said the risk of COVID-19 is real. Gordon said he approves of the lockdown, “and we have to keep it up.”
Containing the pandemic
Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and California state senator who has championed stronger vaccine mandates, described anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters as “essentially selfish” because they put other people at risk.
“One of the hallmarks of the anti-vaccine movement is this sense of selfishness and lack of concern for other people’s health,” Pan said. “They like to talk about rights and freedom. But what they really want is freedom without consequences.”
Both anti-vaccine parents and those who want to relax social distancing assume that the medical system will come to their rescue if they become sick, said Pan, who noted that thousands of health care workers have died while fighting the pandemic.
Fauci has said that relaxing stay-at-home orders is dangerous as long as the virus — for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines — is actively spreading. Reopening businesses too soon could spark a second wave of infections.
More than 75 companies and research groups worldwide are trying to develop vaccines, which are seen as a key weapon against the novel coronavirus.
In the meantime, the CDC says that social distancing measures — such as working from home and avoiding large gatherings — are critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing patients from overwhelming hospitals. Health leaders say it won’t be safe to reopen the county until widespread testing shows the coronavirus has died down.
Americans overwhelmingly support vaccination, according to surveys, and polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 80% of Americans want lockdowns to continue. Only 19% said social distancing orders placed an unnecessary burden on the economy. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
Neither the anti-vaccine nor anti-lockdown demonstrators represent the opinions of most Americans, Pan said.
“Let’s put this movement into proper context,” he said. “They’re loud, they’re noisy and they’re small.”","['false', 'claim', 'cover', 'up', 'championed']"
Lots of politicians and critics across the board have attacked the Green New Deal proposed last week by freshman Democrats Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/the-republicans-dumbest-idea-yet/,alternet,environment,left,5.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"It’s one thing to oppose the grandiose “Green New Deal” as gratuitously imprecise or for its full-throated attack on all-things-ozone and carbon release in our global community.
It feels like something totally other to oppose narrow regulations that could advance the campaign to swap out incandescent light bulbs for light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, a small, practical step that, multiplied into the millions, would passively remove a healthy chunk of energy-eating pollution over time.
Actually, I was surprised to see a recent editorial about all this in The Washington Post, which argued that “Of all the counterproductive policy campaigns conservatives have waged in recent years, among the most irrational has been their war on the federal government’s efforts to update the light bulb.”
Lots of politicians and critics across the board have attacked the Green New Deal proposed last week by freshman Democrats Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist. McConnell scornfully said he would call for an immediate vote on the resolution even before details could be discussed, just to have it swept away.
I understand a president so disdainful of the whole idea of climate change, but what baffles me is why he wants to make things worse.
So, I understand that our politicians want practical over primacy—unless you are discussing border security—and I even understand, sort of, a president who is just so disdainful of the whole idea of climate change as to not discuss what to do about it. But what baffles me is why there would be support to make things worse.
It’s why I find Trump’s support for re-opening coal mines a bit nutty as policy when there is no real marketplace for coal, and the proven resulting pollution obviously makes what is already bad much worse.
As the Post editorial argued, “Swapping out all the old incandescent bulbs across the country would save an astonishing amount of energy, which would translate into big savings for consumers and less pollution over time. But Republicans stymied the Obama administration’s efforts to pursue this policy, which has no downside, and the Trump administration is now using its power over federal efficiency standards to extend the rollback.”
It was in 2007 that Congress mandated a shift toward the LED light bulb. As manufacturers invested in manufacturing lights that use these updated technologies, the prices dropped, the bulbs improved and consumers saw lower energy bills for doing very little.
By 2020, all bulbs were supposed to be LEDs, including bulbs for candelabras, recessed lighting, heavy-duty applications and others also be subject added in the latter days of the Obama era. The Trump administration moved last week to eliminate those addition, despite the fact that the 2020 standards would have saved consumers billions of dollars per year and 140 billion kilowatt-hours in energy waste—the equivalent to the output of 45 coal-fired power plants—in 2025, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which advocates stiffer efficiency programs. Exempting candelabra and other lights from the 2020 standard could cut roughly in half the number of bulbs that would be required to use better technology, research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests. The Appliance Standards Awareness Project estimates that the Trump rollback will cost consumers an additional $12 billion per year in 2025.
The editorial noted that the Trump administration has signaled that it would attempt to roll back the 2020 standards further in coming months.
The editorial concluded, “There is no excuse for unnecessary energy waste and every reason for the federal government to coordinate a move toward better bulbs. The Trump administration should halt its know-nothing rollback.”
In my environmental balance, we should be seeking out painless, passive ways to make things a bit better. As I am reminded about eating towards better health, we need not go on starvation diets, we just need to pay better attention to everyday habits.
The habit in this administration seems to be doing the opposite.",['attacked']

Similarly, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) suggested the president offer a debt-ceiling increase and higher domestic spending caps. Of course, raising the debt limit falls into the same category as re-opening government – it’s a bipartisan priority that has to happen – though higher domestic spending caps is at least a step in the right direction.
I’ve seen some talk about offering DACA protections to Dreamers in exchange for a wall, but Trump has already rejected this offer in the recent past, and besides, at least for now, those DACA protections already exist.
It’s why Republicans will have to think much bigger. What if Trump offered some combination of a universal background check system on gun purchases, dramatically expanded voting rights, and new health care protections? Would Dems be tempted to write a check for the border?
I don’t know. Maybe the president should try it and see what happens.","['dominant', 'giant']"
"While President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial had been wrapping up, he expanded one of his most controversial and inflammatory policies with little fanfare and minimal opposition: the travel ban on people from multiple Muslim-majority countries.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/conservative-magazine-denounces-trumps-cruel-expansion-of-his-muslim-ban/,alternet,immigration,left,5.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"While President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial had been wrapping up, he expanded one of his most controversial and inflammatory policies with little fanfare and minimal opposition: the travel ban on people from multiple Muslim-majority countries.
The previous version, which has been approved by the Supreme Court after it was rewritten multiple times, strictly barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela. In court and in public, the administration defended the extreme and disruptive measure being based on national security considerations, though it was clearly an instantiation of Trump’s bigoted campaign promise to end all Muslim immigration to the United States. When the ban was first enacted, it triggered chaos at airports and prompted widespread protest and legal challenges, and it continues to impose devastating costs on families and people who wish to come to the U.S.
Now, though, the ban has been expanded to include Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania, and the public reaction has been subdued. Perhaps this is because, given the Supreme Court gave it’s blessing on the previous version of the ban, opponents fear there is little that can be done to restrain Trump now.
But Daniel Larison, writing a piece for the magazine The American Conservative that denounced the policy as “cruel,” argued that the new expansion is transparently unnecessary.
“There is no legitimate security reason for such sweeping restrictions, and the new list seems like a grab-bag of countries that have large Muslim populations with nothing else linking them together,” he wrote. “Like previous versions of the ban, this is an attempt to use phony national security justifications to make changes to immigration policy that Congress wouldn’t approve.”
And Larison pointed out that there’s not even any evidence that Nigeria, or the other countries now targeted, export terrorism to the United States, which is ostensibly the reason for the ban. At the same time, a country that actually has seen its nationals commit terrorist acts in the U.S. — Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the Trump administration — is conspicuously missing from the list. Clearly, the point is just to limit immigration, even though Nigerian immigrants “have had great success in the U.S.,” Larison wrote.
New York Times Columnist Jamelle Bouie said that “the only explanation for adding Nigeria to the travel ban is as an act of racial control.”
“The entire expanded travel ban needs to be ended as soon as possible,” said Larison. “Rescinding this ban should be one of the first things that the next administration does.”","['controversial', 'inflammatory']"

Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['egregiously', 'ill-advised', 'stunts', 'awkwardly', 'show']"
"People keep getting sick and the economy is cratering, but for Republicans, hating women is still a major priority: republican governors in Texas, Ohio and even Maryland are trying to use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to block women from getting abortions, claiming that ending a pregnancy is a “nonessential” medical procedure that must be rescheduled.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/gop-uses-the-pandemic-as-an-excuse-to-block-abortion/,alternet,abortion,left,6.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"People keep getting sick and the economy is cratering, but for Republicans, hating women is still a major priority. Republican governors in Texas, Ohio and even Maryland are trying to use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to block women from getting abortions, claiming that ending a pregnancy is a “nonessential” medical procedure that must be rescheduled, as is happening with non-emergency surgeries and other procedures that hospitals are delaying, to prepare for the expected crush of patients infected with COVID-19.
This excuse is farcical on its face, of course. Most abortions are performed not in hospitals, but outpatient clinics. A patient who goes to Planned Parenthood is not taking up space in a hospital because she is not going to the hospital. In order to get around this problem, the misogynists who control the Republican Party are trying to argue that abortion clinics use up needed medical supplies that should go to hospitals instead. This too is a bad-faith argument, especially since Donald Trump is refusing to invoke his presidential powers to compel companies to manufacture those supplies.
We should see these arguments from Republicans as what they are: Excuses for doing what they have wanted to do all along, which is to punish women for having sex by forcing childbirth on them. But abortion is hardly a “nonessential” service, even in a public health crisis. Abortion is essential health care. Having ready access to abortion when it’s needed only becomes more important in a crisis such as this one.
Conservatives talk about abortion as if it were some frivolous decision, made by women who are irresponsible and heedless of consequences. But research shows the exact opposite: Women get abortion to protect not only their own futures, but those of their children.
The Guttmacher Institute’s survey of women who get abortions found that the “reasons most frequently cited were that having a child would interfere with a woman’s education, work or ability to care for dependents (74%); that she could not afford a baby now (73%); and that she did not want to be a single mother or was having relationship problems (48%).” Not on the list of reasons, however, was having an abortion for the hell of it.
An ongoing research project at the University of California, San Francisco, called the Turnaway Study compares women who wanted abortions but didn’t get them with women who were able to have abortions as needed. What researchers have consistently found is that women who were denied abortions are more likely to experience life-threatening complications, more likely to be stuck in abusive relationships, more likely to have mental health issues, and less likely to have aspirational plans for the next year.
Because of all this, Planned Parenthood in Ohio has announced that it will “continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion,” in defiance of an apparent directive from Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican.
The coronavirus crisis only makes the need for accessible abortion all the more pressing, because being pregnant at a time like this is incredibly fraught. As the New York Times reported on Sunday, fertility clinics across the country are canceling procedures like in-vitro fertilization — in part because doctors cannot, in good conscience, recommend pregnancy right now.
But the physical risks are minor compared to the larger social and economic concerns facing women right now. Predictions for the unemployment rate suggest it may soar as high as 30% in the second quarter of this year, which would be worse than the peak levels during the Great Depression. Democrats and Republicans in Congress are negotiating how generous to make the economic stimulus bill for ordinary people, but even the superior Democratic bill falls far short of replacing the full incomes of people thrown out of work. Having a baby is an economic risk even in good times. Right now, it’s more than understandable if that’s a risk many women don’t want to take until things turn around — which may take years.
Of course, the real reason that conservatives want to classify abortion as “nonessential” has little to do with health or economic concerns, and everything to do with sex. It’s all about shaming and stigmatizing people, especially women, who have sex for pleasure instead of as strictly a procreative process within heterosexual marriage.
There’s nothing puritans love more than than the opportunity to shame and police other people for experiencing pleasure. Unfortunately, the coronavirus crisis offers these modern-day crusaders against immorality an all-purpose excuse for their urge to punish others for having fun. Whatever the “official” excuses being offered by anti-choicers for pushing to ban abortion during the coronavirus pandemic may be, it’s really all about the desire to demonize and punish sexually active women to the greatest possible extent.
How can we know this for sure? Because none of the people trying to block abortion access right now are talking about the necessary preventive care that can help people get through this crisis without experiencing unwanted pregnancy: contraception. On the contrary, the same Republicans who are trying to use this crisis as an excuse to ban abortion have also been fighting for years to reduce access to birth control, by trying to keep insurance companies from covering it or preventing state funds from going to clinics like Planned Parenthood that make contraception affordable.
But if we’re going to get through this crisis, we will need to be more generosity, not less, towards people’s desire to find pleasure and comfort where they can — including through sex. People are locked up in their houses, unable to socialize with people other than, in most cases, a spouse or a partner. It exposes the deeply mean-spirited nature of the anti-choice movement that its leaders are so eager to push an anti-sex agenda at a moment when sex is one of the best sources of solace millions of people have.","['cratering', 'hating', 'women', 'excuse', 'nonessential']"
It wasn't long after Donald Trump and his team took office that they looked for ways to make things easier for polluters.,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/even-trump-s-handpicked-scientists-balk-his-approach-science-n1114521,msnbc,environment,left,6.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It wasn't long after Donald Trump and his team took office that they looked for ways to make things easier for polluters. Among the first steps was overhauling the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board: many scholars with academic backgrounds were out, scientists with industry ties were in.
In an unexpected twist, however, despite Team Trump moving the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board to the right, it's still not on board with the White House's agenda. The New York Times reported this week:
A top panel of government-appointed scientists, many of them hand-selected by the Trump administration, said on Tuesday that three of President Trump's most far-reaching and scrutinized proposals to weaken major environmental regulations are at odds with established science. Draft letters posted online Tuesday by the Environmental Protection Agency's Scientific Advisory Board, which is responsible for evaluating the scientific integrity of the agency's regulations, took aim at the Trump administration's rewrite of an Obama-era regulation of waterways, an Obama-era effort to curb planet-warming vehicle tailpipe emissions and a plan to limit scientific data that can be used to draft health regulations.
A Washington Post report added, ""While previous administrations have occasionally pushed back at findings from scientific advisers, or ignored them altogether, friction between the group and the EPA has escalated under Trump -- even though nearly two-thirds of its 44 members were appointed by him.""

The practical implications of this are real, to the extent that the courts may take note of the advisory board's ignored guidance. Patrick Parenteau, a Vermont Law School professor, said, ""The courts basically say if you're going to ignore the advice of your own experts you have to have really good reasons for that. And not just policy reasons but reasons that go to the merits of what the critiques are saying.""
But the implications for the role of scientists in governmental decision making is just as significant -- and far more alarming.
The New York Times had a separate report over the weekend, highlighting the degree to which the Trump has ""diminished"" science's role at the federal level, creating changes that could ""reverberate for years.""
Political appointees have shut down government studies, reduced the influence of scientists over regulatory decisions and in some cases pressured researchers not to speak publicly. The administration has particularly challenged scientific findings related to the environment and public health opposed by industries such as oil drilling and coal mining. It has also impeded research around human-caused climate change, which President Trump has dismissed despite a global scientific consensus. But the erosion of science reaches well beyond the environment and climate: In San Francisco, a study of the effects of chemicals on pregnant women has stalled after federal funding abruptly ended. In Washington, D.C., a scientific committee that provided expertise in defending against invasive insects has been disbanded. In Kansas City, Mo., the hasty relocation of two agricultural agencies that fund crop science and study the economics of farming has led to an exodus of employees and delayed hundreds of millions of dollars in research.
The Times quoted Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, saying, ""The disregard for expertise in the federal government is worse than it's ever been. It's pervasive.""

We should expect growing support for this item for a few reasons: Younger voters of all political stripes are being exposed to the status quo student loan system. Younger voters are also less likely to accept the toxic brand of “conservatism.” ,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/there-are-promising-signs-that-america-is-waking-up-to-the-student-debt-crisis/,alternet,student-debt,left,6.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The revolution to end the burden of student debt continues, with a recent proposal from presidential contender Elizabeth Warren to cancel $50,000 in loans for households making less than $100,000 a year, with lower amounts for those making up to $250,000. Following the Democratic wave, which was driven in part by a surge of youth turnout, it’s more important than ever for Democrats to embrace an ambitious progressive agenda aimed at benefiting the rising American electorate. An ideal policy would be total student debt cancellation.
Earlier this year, Freedom to Prosper and Data for Progress fielded a nationally representative survey analyzing support for repealing Trump’s tax cuts and using the proceeds to cancel outstanding student debt. Across the full sample, 47 percent of respondents supported and 36 percent of respondents opposed the proposal. Contrary to Republicans’ hopes, not only are Trump’s corporate tax handouts unpopular generally, but they are especially so when voters are given the chance to cancel them in favor of a major national debt cancellation program.
According to our analysis of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) 2018 survey, a gold standard political science resource, Democrats won 65 percent of the two-party vote (excluding third-party candidates) among student debt holders, compared with only 50 percent of the vote among non-student debt holders.
The policy is particularly popular among Democrats who support it by a 68-13 margin.
Going into the 2020 election, the key question for Democrats is how to maintain the youthquake that delivered them the House. A war on student debt could do so.
Overall, Millennials support the policy by a 53-24 margin. Generation X respondents back it by a 43-33 margin. Baby Boomers are narrowly split, supporting the policy by a 45-42 margin. Only Silent Generation respondents opposed the policy, by a 39-47 margin. Respondents who are closer in age to the college experience are more likely to support assistance with student debt, as one might expect.
Previously, Freedom to Prosper and Data for Progress had fielded a survey containing the same item. Support increased more than five points since then, from 41 percent in 2018 to 46 percent in 2019.
First, the change in overall opinion is likely driven by Millennials, who are growing as a share of the electorate and are the voters most directly affected by the burden of student loans. Their mean level of support for student debt relief rose by six points from July 2018 to January 2019.
In addition to age, self-reported household income predicted support for supporting student debt relief, when controlling for other factors. As the Democratic Party struggles to appeal to the voters who turned out in 2012 but stayed home in 2016, student debt relief stands out as an issue. Indeed, one in four Americans who voted in 2018 but did not vote in 2016 are student debt holders (the analysis only includes individuals old enough to vote in both elections). Sixty-four percent of these voters supported Democrats.
Student debt has the potential to help Democrats to make inroads with a broad array of voters. As previous Freedom to Prosper research showed, one in five people responsible for paying off a student loan is over the age of 50. Perhaps surprisingly, more than half of individuals over the age of 26 who were responsible for paying off a student loan do not have a college degree, according to the CCES 2016 survey.
We should expect growing support for this item for a few reasons: Younger voters of all political stripes are being exposed to the status quo student loan system. Younger voters are also less likely to accept the toxic brand of “conservatism.” Because party ID and ideology are good predictors of support for student loan relief, and because party ID and ideology are clearly favorable to Democrats among the next generation of voters, we should be prepared to push the issue of student loan forgiveness.

"If sports don’t trump religion as the opiate of the masses, they have, until recently, been at least the background music of most of our lives.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/why-trump-is-so-eager-to-bring-back-professional-sports/,alternet,sport,left,6.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As controversies about the “reopening” of America loom over our lives, nothing seems as intrinsically irrelevant — yet possibly as critically important — as how soon major spectator sports return.
If sports don’t trump religion as the opiate of the masses, they have, until recently, been at least the background music of most of our lives. So here’s my bet on one possible side effect of the Covid-19 pandemic to put in your scorebook: if the National Football League plays regular season games this fall, President Trump stands a good chance of winning reelection for returning America to business as usual — or, at least, to his twisted version of the same.
That’s why he announced at a recent daily coronavirus briefing-cum-rally his eagerness to bring professional sports back quickly. Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old” — the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.
Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season — already poisoned by last year’s Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal — is up for grabs. Certainly, the proposed plan to turn stadiums in the Phoenix, Arizona, area into the sports equivalent of a vast movie set for the games of all 30 major league teams (to be played without fans) seems far-fetched at best.
But football, now the true national pastime, is another matter.
In sports terms, as in so much else in coronaviral America, these are desperately deprived times, even for casual fans. There will be intense pressure — and not only from the president’s base — for that sport’s return. For many people, mostly men, it’s the sustaining soap opera that has always carried them into the next week and the one after that, a porn-ish escape hatch from work and family, a currency of communication with other men, an eternal connection to a non-demanding hive.
Games for Lives?
Without professional (or even college) sports right now or realistically in the near future, fans feel even more unmoored in lives that, for all of us, are distinctly adrift. As they become edgier, it’s a reasonable bet (or at least my hope) that they will also become more open to questioning Trump’s mismanagement — or, to put it more bluntly, sacrifice — of their lives. Recent polls already seem to reflect this, with the latest Gallup Poll showing the steepest approval decline of his presidency.
The president, I suspect, fears just this, though perhaps, in the end, the hole in everyday life where sports once was may only reinforce fans’ sense (like the president’s) that the games are too important not to bring back, safety be damned. Certainly, Trump and other Republican politicians have already been willing enough to forfeit lives to boost their reelection chances.
The values and sensibilities of football are, of course, Trumpist in nature. That’s why former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s demonstration against racism — performed in a kind of public isolation — elicited such a harsh reaction from the president in the now-distant pre-pandemic era. That’s why the sport’s billionaire owners, predominantly Trump donors, shunned Kaepernick (although some of their teams could have used his skills). They didn’t dare to, or care to, give him another platform, not in an era when “president” and “racism” were becoming synonymous.
Even more tellingly, in an understandable but still disappointing me-first display, few of Kaepernick’s fellow players, most of whom are also African-American, supported him publicly. After years of being celebrated as America’s “warriors” and “role models,” they came up desperately short when it counted. Compare them to healthcare workers and other front-line heroes of this pandemic and you’ll realize just how far short they fell of even the most modest form of everyday bravery.
Not that, when it comes to pro sports, football was such an outlier. As activism goes, baseball, a sport that once produced transcendent progressive heroes like Jackie Robinson, Jim Bouton, and Curt Flood, has been eerily quiet in recent years. It’s a sport that the president has paid relatively little attention to — except for suggesting recently that Pete Rose, banned from baseball for life for betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was that team’s manager, should be allowed into its Hall of Fame.
How Trumpian was that? Such betting is, of course, strictly forbidden for active players and managers who are obviously privy to inside information. But, hey, does disregarding inconvenient rules to profit from a privileged position ring any bells these days in Washington?
Trump has, in fact, been uncharacteristically silent on the recent revelation that during the 2017 season, the World Series winners, the Houston Astros, concealed a video camera in center field to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams. That’s also illegal. Major League baseball punished the team by suspending its manager and general manager for a year, imposing a $5 million fine on its owners, and taking away its first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021.
For some fans and commentators, the Astros’ punishment was too severe or too mild. Opposing players, feeling victimized by the scheme, thought specific Astros should have been penalized, too. Yet such cheating is hardly new. In 1951, the “shot heard round the world,” a famed home-run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and sent them to the World Series, was linked to the stealing of signs from the Brooklyn Dodgers through a hand-held telescope. Only the technology has improved.
A Changing National Pastime
Once baseball’s opening day passed without a pitch this April, proof that the plague was winning, the Phoenix Plan was floated. It would require all major league players and employees to be sequestered in that area and continually tested at a moment when tests might still not be universally available. But, hey, haven’t VIP Jocks always gone to the head of the line? (Actually, a massive study of 10,000 Major League Baseball employees, from players to popcorn vendors, being conducted by Stanford University and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory to find out how many contracted and may have recovered from the virus has already gotten access to such testing kits at a time when even some front-line workers can’t get them!)
For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As the country reeled from the revelation of President Bill Clinton’s sexual liaison with a White House intern and with his impeachment just around the corner, a feel-good legend was born. A white man and a brown man rose in friendly rivalry to break the 37-year-old record of 61 home runs by Roger Maris, who, in turn, had bested Babe Ruth’s famed 60 in 1927.
The good-natured competition between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (who won with 70 homers) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs (66) was, at the time, celebrated as a balm that should soothe the country. And perhaps for many fans it did indeed serve as a comforting distraction in a difficult political moment.
But that summer’s golden glow soon faded as both players were reported to have taken steroids to muscle up. McGwire would admit it years later; Sosa would not. (A dark-skinned Dominican, he further complicated his legend by bleaching his skin to whiten himself, as if in anticipation of the Trumpian racial preferences to come.) Their contemporary, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, would eventually become the single-season home run leader with 73, but has never shaken rumors that he, too, used steroids.
Nor did baseball ever fully recover its sense of primacy as the national pastime or its sense of righteousness as one of America’s first major institutions to integrate. In fact, the sport is still overwhelmingly white and skewed toward an older audience, as well as slow and outdated in an era of tweeting speed.
Which is why, whether or not baseball opens this season in a vast sports self-isolation experiment, the key to President Trump’s future lies in his perverse relationship with the National Football League. That goes back more than 30 years to the moment he tried unsuccessfully (as with so many other business ventures) to elbow his way into the sport. Give him credit, though: ever attuned to the public mood, he did sense the rise of a new national pastime.
Bet On This
One reason for the NFL’s growing popularity is the way it uses college football as its minor leagues and early showcase for pro players (though possibly not this fall). For a passionate pro football fan, it’s a pleasure to see the stars of tomorrow in the making. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. In a recent commentary in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Nathan Kalman-Lamb of Duke opines that high-revenue men’s football and basketball “will become more valuable than ever as an enticement to lure steep tuition from students.”
And here’s an innovation that the president would glory in, one that would make post-pandemic football an even greater success: the addition of real-time nationwide legal gambling on games. Just imagine the sort of Trump-donor dollars that would be stacked up to support such a future industry. After all, estimations are that illegal gambling on pro and college football is already a $93 billion business. Legal or not, it’s an integral part of the fan experience (though in the post-pandemic world there will be a lot less money in so many pockets to gamble with).
The dream of easily accessible, high-tech legal gambling has been lurking on the sidelines for years. All that’s necessary to make it come true is for Congress to reverse the 1992 Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act, the federal law that bans it in most states. And the pandemic moment may prove perfect for just that, for “reopening” football in a new and even more Trumpian way, allowing fans to sit at home and bet what money they have left on games in progress: Will that field goal attempt split the uprights? Will Tom Brady in his new Tampa Bay Buccaneers uniform make that crucial third-down conversion?
However, to reopen pro football, as the president would wish, to make life seem “normal” again, stadiums might have to remain empty (or partially empty). Imagine, for instance, if San Francisco had actually beaten Kansas City (which it didn’t) in the Super Bowl on the first Sunday in February and the expected championship parade had followed a few days later, drawing a million people to that city’s streets. It might have proved an early version of Mardi Gras (a 2020 coronaviral disaster of a get-together).
Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. From the huddle to tackling, the game is, in every way, a potential disease transmitter. The only example of social distancing (besides Kaepernick kneeling alone) I can even remember might have been the 1958 West Point football team, which fielded a “lonesome end,” Bill Carpenter. On every play, he set himself up near the far sideline in an innovative formation. He never even joined the huddle and that team went undefeated.
If it proves impossible to stage football games, given social-distancing rules, the inevitable sport of the future is already waiting in the wings. Just under the radar of most of the middle-aged and elderly, especially those without access to children, is a fiercely contested, already commodified, fan-friendly industry with championships, heroes, endorsement contracts, and a ready market for expensive gear. I’m thinking, as you may have guessed, of competitive online video games, or esports. (Think of it as the revenge of the nerds.) No matter what Donald Trump does, sooner rather than later they’re likely to replace the old up-close-and-contagious live games.
It’s not hard to imagine a future in which individual competitors, regional and national teams, leagues, or even some version of the Olympics, would be watched by millions on streaming platforms on home screens and, once social distancing becomes a historical footnote, on the screens of sports bars as well, if not theaters and arenas. While combat games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, along with sports knock-offs like Madden and NBA Live, currently dominate esports, the future will undoubtedly include brainier fare that will turn art, architecture, banking, diplomacy, music, and maybe even poetry into online competitions even Nike and Google could sponsor.
Esports already supports ESPN-style commentary. There might even be room someday for a new reality show about them hosted by a motor-mouthed, pumpkin-headed former one-term president.
Who needs football after all? It would, in fact, be the definition of madness to launch a football season in a coronaviral world. But that doesn’t mean Donald Trump won’t push for just that. The advisory board he appointed for the reopening of sports includes, as my colleague Dave Zirin points out, “a group of brigands defined by their lack of care in normal times for the safety and well-being of their employees.”
It’s Trump’s dream team because, to win in November, he needs an America in which the National Football League is back in business big time. For him it’s open arms for the NFL, which could mean open season on the rest of us.

"A federal judge in Tucson, Arizona delivered a blow Monday to the Trump administration’s strategy of criminalizing humanitarian aid work along the southern border with her decision to overturn the convictions of four volunteers on religious freedom grounds.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/judge-reverses-profoundly-disturbing-convictions-of-border-humanitarians/,alternet,immigration,left,7.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A federal judge in Tucson, Arizona delivered a blow Monday to the Trump administration’s strategy of criminalizing humanitarian aid work along the southern border with her decision to overturn the convictions of four volunteers on religious freedom grounds.
U.S. District Judge Rosemary Márquez concluded in a 22-page opinion (pdf) that Natalie Hoffman, Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse, and Zaachila Orozco-McCormick—volunteers with the religious aid group No More Deaths/No Más Muertes—had “met their burden of establishing that their activities were exercises of their sincere religious beliefs” under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).
When governments want to do everything in their power to bring punishment for morality & decency, we must still have faith. It won’t be an easy fight, but they will not have the last word when there is hope. #nomoredeaths https://t.co/MNmt3hDM8M — New Sanctuary Coalition (@NewSanctuaryNYC) February 4, 2020
In a bench trial last year, U.S. District Judge Bernardo Velasco found all four volunteers guilty of federal misdemeanors for entering the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge without a permit, driving on a restricted-access road, and leaving food and water for migrants. Velasco fined the volunteers $250 each and sentenced them to 15 months of unsupervised probation.
The refuge, located in the Sonoran Desert along the southern border, serves as a common—yet dangerous—route for migrants to cross into the United States. Márquez’s opinion noted that the remains of more than 2,800 migrants were found in Pima County between 2000 and 2017, and the actual number of deaths in the area—often tied to dehydration and exposure to the extreme conditions—is believed to be much higher. In an effort to prevent more deaths, humanitarian aid volunteers leave supplies in the desert for those passing through.
Although the four volunteers in Monday’s case were not charged with immigration-related offenses, the federal government asserted that it has a compelling interest in “enforcing the border and controlling immigration,” and claimed that the volunteers’ actions “furthered and encouraged illegal smuggling activity” in the refuge. Addressing that issue, Márquez wrote:
The government seems to rely on a deterrence theory, reasoning that preventing clean water and food from being placed on the refuge would increase the risk of death or extreme illness for those seeking to cross unlawfully, which in turn would discourage or deter people from attempting to enter without authorization. In other words, the government claims a compelling interest in preventing defendants from interfering with a border enforcement strategy of deterrence by death. This gruesome logic is profoundly disturbing. It is also speculative and unsupported by evidence. As discussed above, 32 sets of human remains were recovered from the refuge in 2017 alone, and the government produced no evidence that these fatalities had any effect in deterring unlawful entry. Nor has the government produced evidence that increasing the death toll would have such an effect.
Thus, the judge concluded, “the government failed to demonstrate that it furthered any compelling interest by prosecuting defendants.”
The Trump administration began with prosecutors, Border Patrol agents and Fish and Wildlife officials bringing a series of charges against @NoMoreDeaths volunteers. This is the second time in a matter of months that those charges have been defeated on religious liberty grounds. — Ryan Devereaux (@rdevro) February 4, 2020
In a statement Tuesday, No More Deaths volunteer Alicia Dinsmore said that “this ruling reaffirms what No More Deaths has always maintained: providing life-saving humanitarian aid is never a crime.”
“The reversal of the convictions is a victory for all people of conscience and righteousness who seek to end the death and suffering in the borderlands,” Dinsmore added. “People continue to die every day on Cabeza Prieta and we will continue to act on our moral imperative to do this vital work.”
The ruling also was welcomed Monday by professor Katherine Franke, faculty director of the Law, Rights, and Religion Project at Columbia Law School. Franke, who had filed a friend of the court brief in the case on behalf of seven religious liberty law scholars, said in a statement that “we are quite pleased to see that Judge Márquez applied an analysis of the RFRA claim that mirrored the structure we provided in our brief.”
“Judge Márquez’s opinion marks a significant defeat for the Department of Justice in its effort to protect religious liberty rights only when they advance the White House’s political agenda,” Franke noted. “This is now the second time in several months that a federal judge has granted a faith-based defense raised by immigrants’ rights activists who are being criminally prosecuted by the federal government for coming to the aid of people crossing the deadly Arizona desert.”
As the statement explained, in November 2019, U.S. District Judge Raner Collins granted the RFRA defense raised by No More Death’s volunteer Scott Warren related to misdemeanor charges that arose from his humanitarian work. Last year, Warren also faced felony charges and up to 20 years in prison for providing food, water, clean clothes, and shelter to two men traveling through the Sonoran Desert.
Warren was acquitted of the felony charges at his second trial in November, just months after his first trial for those charges ended with a hung jury. The case garnered global attention, with human rights advocates worldwide demanding that federal prosecutors drop the charges and stop “criminalizing compassion.”
Greg Kuykendall, who represented @NoMoreDeaths volunteer Scott Warren in two other cases stemming from the administration’s crackdown, said the reversal reveals what the government refuses to acknowledge. “They need dead bodies in order for their deterrence strategies to work.” — Ryan Devereaux (@rdevro) February 4, 2020
Ryan Devereaux reported for The Intercept Tuesday that “all told, Trump administration prosecutors, working alongside the U.S. Border Patrol and Fish and Wildlife officials, have brought charges against nine No More Deaths volunteers in the past two and a half years.”
Franke told Devereaux that although she expects the government to appeal Márquez’s decision, the judge thoroughly and carefully analyzed the religious liberty claim.
“The government isn’t going to roll over just because they lose a case or two,” she said. “But what we’ve got now is a developing record of careful analysis from federal courts on how RFRA ought to apply in contexts like this.”

"In fact, the scenario of killing babies after they're born that Trump depicted was ridiculously false.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-lies-about-abortion-take-alarming-and-incendiary-turn,msnbc,abortion,left,7.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump held his latest campaign rally in Green Bay on Saturday night, and as he’s done on several recent occasions, the president focused attention on abortion rights. In this case, the Republican described a very specific scenario:
“The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
The audience, on cue, expressed its disapproval of such conditions, booing loudly, as if their president had told them a gruesome truth.
He hadn’t. In fact, the scenario Trump depicted was ridiculously false. The New York Times published a detailed, albeit understated, fact-check piece, but the bottom line remains the same: there are no instances in which a healthy baby is born, only to be murdered soon after following a chat between a woman and her doctor.
If the White House can point to a single instance in which this has ever happened, anywhere in the United States, officials should feel free to present such an example to the public.
They won’t, because they can’t.
The problem in this case, however, isn’t limited to the obvious fact that the president lied – an alarmingly common occurrence – but rather, it’s the nature of this specific lie that stands out.
In an era in which domestic terrorism is an increasingly deadly societal scourge, it’s dangerous when a sitting American president lies to rabid followers with tales of infants being executed in medical facilities.
Complicating matters, Saturday night was an extreme example, but it was hardly the first example of Team Trump using incendiary rhetoric of late on the issue of reproductive rights.
As regular readers know, it was early last month when House Democrats launched an expansive investigation into presidential abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release an official press statement accusing Dems of trying to “distract” the public from the party’s agenda – which she said includes “killing babies after they’re born.”
Soon after, the president’s chief spokesperson went a little further. Asked about the virtues of possibly lowering the rhetorical temperature in D.C., the president’s chief spokesperson decided to do the opposite.
“Look, I think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable of coming together and agreeing on the fact that they’re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother’s womb or killing a baby after birth,” Sanders said.
The use of the word “comfortable” was of particular interest – as if Democrats agree with the White House press secretary’s incendiary and false rhetoric.
No good can come of this.",['ridiculously']
Obama’s joke about moat with alligators came to mind while reading a newly published report from the New York Times on Donald Trump’s zealotry on border policy.,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-envisioned-border-moat-stocked-snakes-or-alligators,msnbc,immigration,left,7.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In Barack Obama’s first term as president, Republicans issued a challenge to the Democratic White House: increasing border security would open the door to a bipartisan reform package. Obama accepted the offer at face value and significantly increased border security.
With this in mind, the Democratic president traveled to El Paso in May 2011 for a speech on immigration policy, and he explained at the time, “We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we’ve done.”
Obama added, however, that GOP officials were complaining anyway. “Maybe they’ll need a moat,” he said to laughter. “Maybe they want alligators in the moat. They’ll never be satisfied.”
Obama’s joke came to mind while reading a newly published report from the New York Times on Donald Trump’s zealotry on border policy.
Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.
Among the things I found amazing about this was the idea of aides “seeking a cost estimate.” I’m trying to imagine assorted officials in the West Wing, making calls and poking around online, trying to figure out what it would cost to buy a bunch of snakes and alligators for a moat, all in the hopes of satisfying their strange boss.
But as amusing as this may seem, it’s the other part of the excerpt that’s far more serious: Trump encouraged those around him to do things the law would not allow them to do.
In fact, this new report from the New York Times featured a variety of examples of presidential indifference toward legal limits. In one instance, Trump reportedly told then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to speed up the construction of border barriers. “[S]he said they needed permission from property owners,” the article noted. “Take the land, Mr. Trump would say, and let them sue us.”
It brought to mind recent remarks from former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told an audience about the kind of instructions he’d receive from Trump. “So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’” Tillerson explained. “And I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law.’”
Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, of course, is also filled with examples of Trump directing people to take legally dubious actions.
As MSNBC’s Chris Hayes added last night, in response to the latest Times report, “The president is fundamentally and unalterably lawless.” If you’re one of those folks who chanted, “Rule of law” during Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies, I have some very bad news for you.
Postscript: Trump, for what it’s worth, has denied the accuracy of the latest reporting. Of course, Trump has also denied all sorts of other reports, many of which proved to be true.",['zealotry']
"The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/how-the-religious-rights-war-against-abortion-is-built-on-lies-grifting-and-bullying/,alternet,abortion,left,7.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Tuesday, both the pro- and anti-choice world were rocked by a revelation that undermines literal decades of religious right nonsense. Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous “conversion” to anti-abortion activism was a con job.
McCorvey told filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, “AKA Jane Roe,” “I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
For pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey’s “conversion” as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don’t want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless “abortion industry.”
McCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was “saved” by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can’t be trusted with autonomy, and need “godly” men to guide them.
(Benham, a supposedly wise and “pro-life” guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among the protesters, clinic staff and the pregnant people seeking care.)
Having spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey’s “conversion” was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped, even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn’t try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn’t seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.
So yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers — nearly half a million dollars over the years — sounds about right.
But the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn’t about McCorvey’s character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire raison d’être is telling lies — often over-the-top, melodramatic lies — in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the “right” of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.
The anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become one big, long con.
The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.
For instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)
To bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice “testimony” is all to often as McCorvey described it: “[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
But this “born alive” mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump’s weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.
The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.
A series of “undercover” videos purporting to “prove” that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling “baby parts” out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would turn out to be bullshit, but too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.
Sure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn’t sell baby parts.” They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research — research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.
This myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest buffer zone around clinics by claiming they were merely “sidewalk counselors” trying to “help” women.
An investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They’re a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.
“If women want careers and education and everything and they don’t want children,” one protester complained to Filipovic, “what are they doing having sex?”
Another complained that “there were no problems” back when women “had to be obedient to their husbands.”
Instead of contraception, a protester argued, “the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”
The court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters merely wished to “counsel” women.
Anti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they’re righteous warriors going up against a sleazy “abortion industry” and trying to “save” women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.
In truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them of their rights and subjugate them both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stands with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny and lurid fantasy.
The press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie will help open up some eyes.
But it’s also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don’t want or can’t bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It’s a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.","['comical', 'theatrical', 'lies', 'anti-choice', 'ridiculous']"
Lawmakers who claim to care about women’s emotional health would do better to listen to the hundreds of thousands of women who seek abortion care every year and know it is the right decision.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/debunking-the-abortion-regret-narrative-data-shows-women-99-percent-of-women-feel-relief-over-their-decision/,alternet,abortion,left,8.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Last month, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a Kentucky law requiring doctors to describe ultrasound images and play fetal heartbeat sounds to people seeking abortions. The state argued that these images and sounds best “inform a patient of the nature and consequences of an abortion.” In 2007, Justice Anthony Kennedy based his decision to ban an abortion procedure on the grounds that “while we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice” to have an abortion.
The specter of “abortion regret” has been used by lawmakers and judges alike to impose or uphold rules making it harder for people to get abortions. In Kansas, doctors must tell their patients that life begins at conception and the fetus is a separate living being — neither of which is supported by medical research. Women in Kentucky who want an abortion now must undergo an ultrasound and hear a description of their fetus. And in states like Missouri or North Carolina, women must have at least two appointments with a waiting period in between before an abortion, to give them time to reconsider their choice. This means they must make an appointment, get time off work, arrange child care, and drive, sometimes for hours, to the clinic. Then they must do it all again days later.
But new research reveals the truth: Five years after obtaining an abortion, the overwhelming majority of women do not regret their decision—even those who had difficulty deciding to get one. This evidence contradicts the narrative pushed by anti-abortion activists and elected officials, who use “abortion regret” as a red herring to implement regulations pushing abortion out of reach for many—especially women of color and low-income people.
Our research found that, among hundreds of women having abortions all across the United States, most felt their decision was the right one for them five years later. The research was based on data from 667 participants in the Turnaway Study, a long-term study of the effects of abortion on women’s lives conducted by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at University of California, San Francisco.
As expected, women experienced ranges of negative and positive emotions in the week following the abortion. Yet, over time, women reported declining intensity of all emotions. This was true even for women who said that their decision to get an abortion was a difficult one and those who felt they would be shamed by friends and community for their choice. Both immediately after the abortion and five years later, the feeling women most often expressed about their decision was relief, not regret. By the end of five years, the chance that women reported that their abortion was the right decision was 99 percent. Ninety-nine percent. Our team also found in an earlier paper that there was no difference in emotions between women who sought abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy and those who sought later abortions.
Until now, without data on the topic, the narrative around supposed “abortion regret” has been dominated by the few individual stories of women who come to wish they’d made a different choice. But the responses from the women we studied in our paper paint a very different picture.
“It was the right thing for me, for my son, for our family. You know, it just—I don’t think about it,” one participant told researchers. “It’s just like oh, thank god. You know, my life would be so different right now.”
“It was the right decision because I was still a child myself. I wasn’t financially stable. It was just—it wasn’t really smart for me to bring a child into this world to struggle along with me,” another said.
“I actually feel guilty sometimes—you know people talk about you’ll regret it all your life—I don’t ever think of it. I feel guilty that I don’t feel guilty. You know what I mean? I don’t want people to think that I’m heartless, I’m not—at all. I just, it doesn’t impact me negatively,” said a third.
This last quote is particularly revealing, because it shows how women are told by society that they should regret their abortions and then, even when they know fully that abortion was the right decision for them, feel guilt for not meeting that expectation. Contrary to lawmakers’ stated intentions, research shows that restrictions targeting the “regret” claim don’t actually dissuade women from getting abortions. They just worsen stigma and make getting care more difficult.
It is true that some women have complicated feelings about their abortions, and some do wish they had not had one. But it is also true that every major life decision, medical or otherwise, carries with it the risk of regret. As bioethicists have pointed out, some patients regret having heart surgery or seeking a kidney transplant. For that matter, some people regret marrying their high-school sweetheart, or having children. All of these actions may carry lasting consequences. Yet lawmakers do not intervene to take these choices away — only the choice to have an abortion.
Access to abortion has clear benefits for both the person seeking care and for society as a whole. The social, economic, and medical good of abortion access for the hundreds of thousands of women who seek care every year outweighs the small chance that someone will later regret her choice. Lawmakers who claim to care about women’s emotional health would do better to listen to the hundreds of thousands of women who seek abortion care every year and know it is the right decision. They should stop using false “abortion regret” arguments as an excuse and step out of the way.

“As you know, there have been an exodus of scientists across many of the federal agencies. This exodus has been driven largely because the results of their work has been suppressed. Indeed, recently a well-regarded physicist/chemist Dr. Rod Schoonover left the U.S. Department of State due to the suppression of even a security-cleared version of his assessment on the impact of climate change on national security. I add parenthetically that, in my opinion, the Department of State can ill afford the loss of any good scientists. “My question is: Do you support the suppression of scientific reports from within the U.S. Department of State? If not, how did this happen? And if so, why?”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at an event Kansas on Friday, where he fielded a question from a Kansas State University physics professor who asked a very good question
Pompeo was less impressed with the question than I was.
“Well, it won’t shock you that I disagree with most of what you just said. Of course, no one supports the absence of science. I would argue that this State Department – indeed, this administration – has relied on science far more than the previous administration, and I would argue more than any administration in history. […] “We turn to scientists and facts-based approaches to every single difficult challenge we face every day.”
I realize the cabinet secretary was able to say all of this with a straight face. That’s part of the problem. The idea that the Trump administration has set a historically high bar, relying on science in ways that exceed every administration in the history of the country, is completely bonkers.
Indeed, the timing of Pompeo’s comments was almost comical: the same day the Kansas Republican praised Team Trump’s handling of science, Trump’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration threw National Weather Service scientists under the bus for daring to tell the public truths the president didn’t like.
The ridiculous incident signaled to scientists throughout the government that there’s an expectation their work will be in accordance with the White House’s political vision.
Alas, Friday wasn’t an especially unusual day. As you’ve probably seen Rachel report on the show in recent months, the administration has also gone to absurd lengths to force out career scientists at the USDA whose work has proved inconvenient to the White House.
What’s more, Trump’s choice to be the chief scientist at the USDA wasn’t actually a scientist.
Similarly, Politico reported in June, “The Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department’s acclaimed in-house scientists.”
EPA scientists have hardly fared any better, not just on the climate crisis, but also on issues such as exposure to potentially dangerous chemicals.
What’s more, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy was largely empty for quite a while after Trump took office. It finally received a Senate-confirmed director this year, after the office was vacant for two years.
By any sensible measure, the Trump administration is among the worst ever seen for respecting, valuing, and following science. For Pompeo to publicly insist the opposite is a reminder of the secretary of State’s non-existent credibility.","['worst', 'ever', 'sensible']"
"The travel ban would not have prevented the country’s deadliest terrorist attacks in recent years, which were committed by right-wing Americans, not immigrants: the anti-immigrant extremist who killed 22 shoppers at a store in El Paso; the white supremacist who killed 17 students and teachers at a school in Parkland, Florida; or the anti-Semite who killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/i-collected-the-data-and-trumps-new-travel-ban-has-little-to-do-with-national-security/,alternet,immigration,left,8.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Charles Kurzman, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Over the past two decades, how many people have been killed in the U.S. by extremists from the six countries on the Trump administration’s new travel ban list?
The answer is zero, according to data I have collected from Department of Justice records and other sources. Immigrants from these countries constitute less than 1% of terrorism cases in the United States, and none of the cases in the last two years.
The same is true for the original travel bans imposed in 2017. There were, and still are, zero fatalities in the United States caused by extremists from the countries on those lists, too.
One attempted attack in decades
Under the new ban, which begins on Feb. 22, citizens of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania will no longer be able to apply for immigrant visas.
The White House says these countries “must satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America’s law-enforcement and intelligence professionals” in order for the ban to be lifted.
However, there is no evidence that immigrants from these six countries pose a national security threat to the United States.
In fact, only one citizen from any of these countries has attempted a terrorist attack in the United States: 11 years ago, a man from Nigeria tried but failed to ignite explosives in his underwear as his flight approached Detroit. Nobody was injured, apart from the would-be bomber.
In recent years, Nigeria has “actively cooperated with the United States and other international partners” to prevent further attacks, according to a State Department report last October.
The new ban wouldn’t have stopped the underwear bomber, in any case, because he was traveling on a tourist visa, and the new ban applies only to immigrant visas.
Immigrant extremism versus domestic extremism
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and many of his administration’s policies have played on the trope of threats posed by refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants.
However, the administration’s own security agencies view homegrown and domestic terrorism as a greater threat than extremist violence by foreigners.
“We now assess the most predominant terrorist threat to the Homeland to emanate from U.S.-based lone actors,” the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center testified to Congress in November.
For more than a decade, under three administrations, the FBI’s annual briefing on worldwide terrorist threats has rated American extremism as a greater concern than foreign operatives. The director of the FBI repeated this point in congressional testimony several days after the new travel ban was announced.
The travel ban would not have prevented the country’s deadliest terrorist attacks in recent years, which were committed by right-wing Americans, not immigrants: the anti-immigrant extremist who killed 22 shoppers at a store in El Paso; the white supremacist who killed 17 students and teachers at a school in Parkland, Florida; or the anti-Semite who killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.
The travel ban also would not have prevented the most recent attack by a foreign national – the Saudi officer who killed three sailors at a naval air base in Pensacola. The officer did not arrive on an immigrant visa, and the ban specifically exempts Saudi Arabia.
Fanning fears
National security has a special status in government policy – policymakers are given extra leeway on security issues in order to safeguard against existential threats.
A generation ago, during the Cold War, those threats involved nuclear missiles and million-man armies. After 9/11, the primary threat was mass casualty attacks by nongovernmental organizations. Today, fortunately, those threats have diminished to the point that the latest National Security Strategy of the United States focuses on lone individuals with small arms, homemade explosives, vehicles and knives.
This violence is a concern, but not a leading threat to public safety. Terrorists were responsible for only one-fifth of 1% of the 290,000 murders in the United States since 9/11, according to data from the Global Terrorism Database and the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. The government’s counterterrorism dragnet, involving thousands of agents over many years, has discovered fewer and fewer plots in recent years.
Still, many Americans do not feel safe. Half of the respondents in recent surveys say they worry about being the victim of a terrorist attack.
Trump’s new travel ban asks Americans to believe that they will be more secure without immigration from Nigeria and five other countries. In my view, that is an insult both to those countries and to the country that calls itself the home of the brave.

"That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-brutalizing-protesters-would-save-him-he-was-wrong/,alternet,elections-2020,left,8.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['the', 'flames', 'failings', 'fanning', 'as', 'a', 'person']"

Every June, Congress debates what to do about the interest rate on federally subsidized student loans, to avert what this year will be the imminent doubling from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. But interest rates alone don’t tell the whole story.
At a time when overall student debt approaches $1 trillion, the facts reveal that student loans aren’t loans, not in the traditional sense. They exhibit none of the qualities of modern consumer financial instruments, and are often sold under false pretenses, with the promise of a lifelong benefit that never materializes. We need to change how these loans work and have a broader conversation about what we should be doing — including bankruptcy and refinancing — to help future generations obtain a quality, affordable education, which is critical to our economic future.
The roughly two-thirds of U.S. students who take out loans to finance their college education can end up in a situation most resembling the historical concept of indenture. In medieval times, peasants would sign deeds to work land, which would then get cut in a jagged line (looking like teeth, or “dentures”). Each party would get half, and rejoining them would prove the authenticity of the contract. Colonial indentures would trade years of labor for the opportunity of transportation to the New World. The indentured could not alter the terms of the contract, no matter their circumstances. One way or another, the debt would get paid.
This is basically how student loans work. A college student might remember freshman orientation, when an instructor told them to look to their left and right, explaining, “One of you won’t graduate.” But student loans aren’t extinguished for those who don’t finish college; instead, the debt becomes a burdensome reminder of this early mistake in life. This is also true for students snookered into matriculating at sketchy for-profit colleges, which offer almost no marketable skills or career preparedness to justify the cost. And it further describes recent college graduates who, through an accident of timing, entered the real world during the Great Recession and its aftermath, finding it difficult to obtain work in their field of study.
Due to these combined factors, delinquency rates for student loans – unlike auto, credit card or even mortgage debt – have risen the past two years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But student debt is something you carry for the rest of your life. It’snearly impossible to refinance student loans, despite the current low-rate environment, primarily because of the high credit risk and lack of collateral. And unlike most other loans, you cannot get rid of student debt through bankruptcy.","['snookered', 'Recession']"

Proponents of stricter protections for students argue the DOE’s recent rollback of Obama-era rules aimed at protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges will only lead to even more student failing to pay back their loans.,https://www.alternet.org/2017/09/more-defaulting-student-loans/,alternet,student-debt,left,9.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"As the cost of higher education skyrockets, student loan debt has become an unavoidable rite of passage for most college students. Collectively, Americans owe a whopping $1.45 trillion in student loan debt, which outpaces credit card debt by upward of $600 billion. While many people consider money taken out to obtain a degree to be “good debt,” new numbers from the Department of Education (DOE) show an alarming number of Americans just can’t afford it.
After declining for four years in a row, the number of people who have defaulted on their student loans has risen to 11.5%. Though that number is still lower than it was five years ago when the default rate was 14.7% — thanks to the Obama administration’s aggressive push to offer options like income-based loan payments and its commitment to go after for-profit institutions that saddled students with mountains of debt — the uptick in defaults is not a good sign for the economy. Now, a record 8.5 millionAmericans are in default on their loans, and that number just keeps growing.
Along with the updated numbers, the DOE also listed 10 colleges whose student loan default rate is over 30%, which could result in a loss of access to federal financial aid funds. Proponents of stricter protections for students argue the DOE’s recent rollback of Obama-era rules aimed at protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges will only lead to even more student defaulting on their loans.
“Now is the time to be improving student loan policies and increasing oversight and accountability,” said Pauline Abernathy, executive vice president of the The Institute for College Access and Success. “But the Department is doing the opposite. The Department’s rollback of critical protections and enforcement will only lead to more student loan defaults, higher debt burdens, and wasted taxpayer dollars.”

This is a positive for the party’s electoral prospects, after a bitterly fragmented primary. Unfortunately, the people selected for the task forces demonstrate how not only the party establishment, but even an insurgent progressive like Sanders, privilege certain topics over others. The criminal justice reform task force is incredibly milquetoast.
While status quo-shattering progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) are included on the climate change and healthcare committees, respectively, not a single person in the criminal justice reform group brings comparable strength of ideas or clout.
Biden’s five picks are typical of centrists who want to trim the edges of our bloated, draconian justice system without changing anything systemically.
Two are top members of the Obama Department of Justice (DOJ): former Attorney General Eric Holder and former acting assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta. While these figures supported deprioritizing federal enforcement of anti-marijuana laws and expressed some dismay toward the harshest mandatory minimum prison sentences for drugs, they did little to address federal prosecutors’ complete lack of accountability—due to secrecy and their near-unlimited discretion, which they often use to push for very harsh sentences to match the non-mandatory US Sentencing Guidelines.
Biden also chose Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), who has a fairly decent track record on opposing mandatory minimums. But Rep. Scott is still a far cry from a fellow Congressional moderate who was not selected: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who has proposed the return of federal parole and other sweeping changes. To round out his side of the table, Biden chose Raumesh Akbari, a state senator from Tennessee who has accomplished virtually nothing to decarcerate at home, and Symone Sanders, a political aide who defended Biden’s pro-mass incarceration past and has narrow professional experience in this area.
Reformers expected Biden to be weak on decarceration, considering he promulgated the noxious 1994 Crime Bill, among other stains on his record, and has shown little interest in mass incarceration outside of maintaining it.
But Sanders’ picks are where things get devastatingly disappointing.
It’s 2020, not 1990. Even setting aside the many non-law enforcement options for a moment, Sanders had dozens of relatively progressive elected prosecutors to choose from if he wished to balance credibility with moderates with the need for real change. Sanders is familiar with at least several of them, having personally endorsed them.
Yet instead, he appointed three ineffective, unambitious choices: Chiraag Bains of Demos, a small center-left think tank; South Carolina State Representative Justin Bamberg; and Linn County, Iowa Supervisor Stacey Walker.
First things first, Sanders was good to his people—Bamberg was an endorser in 2016 (though he originally backed Hillary Clinton), and Walker worked his Iowa campaign.
Bamberg does have the noteworthy experience of being a civil litigator who has sued on behalf of many of the most high-profile victims of police brutality and killings. Yet that translates only to a limited degree into forming a policy agenda that ends mass incarceration. Thanks to the power of police unions and police willingness to punish any politician who stands in the way of impunity for violence, police are also the hardest part of the criminal justice system to reform.
In terms of bills proposed, Bamberg wants substantial reforms that would make people on parole eligible for lower-level felonies after serving a third of a prison sentence of 30 years or less, or 10 years of a life sentence.
However, many common nonviolent drug felonies are so-called “unclassified” felonies under South Carolina law, placing them into the current “no parole” offense category. Bamberg’s bill gives credence to this bogus idea, noting that people serving time on current “no parole” felonies—like most meth charges, or an 18-year-old sharing heroin with a 17-year-old—would have to serve fully 65 percent of their sentence in prison, and face intensive supervision until the 85 percent threshold is hit. Knowing that his parole reform bill would not pass through a Republican-dominated legislature in the Deep South anyway, Bamberg might still have addressed this as a symbolic gesture.
Meanwhile, Iowa’s Stacey Walker has no substantive criminal justice experience on his resume. Some of his career is certainly admirable, such as his work to help at-risk kids graduate high school. But it seems his most noteworthy criminal justice accomplishment was putting implicit bias training for county prosecutors on the agenda, much to his county attorney’s laughable chagrin.
Unfortunately, implicit bias training doesn’t even work. The Urban Institute conducted an audit of DOJ’s National Initiative for Building Community Trust—a multi-million dollar program including implicit bias training in police departments as a primary objective. Nancy La Vigne, the Urban Institute’s vice president for justice policy, recently “liked” a tweet stating that her organization deemed the project “essentially worthless.”
Finally, there is Chiraag Bains, who has a managerial role at Demos as the director of Legal Strategies. But Demos is not even a criminal justice reform-specific organization. According to Bains’ biography page, only a fraction of his docket is on-topic—and even then it deals with the fringes of ending mass incarceration, such as protecting “voting rights of pretrial detainees and others unlawfully disenfranchised through the criminal justice system.” While admirable, this is probably not what most voters think of when they hear “criminal justice reform”—they think of ending mass incarceration.
To that point, Bains was also an Obama DOJ prosecutor, albeit with a caseload addressing the kinds of people liberals want to lock up, such as hate crimes, arson against reproductive health clinics, and the like.
Sanders could and should have gotten some real innovators in there. There is a large network of progressive criminal justice reform professionals with both a strong grasp on policy and the belief that mass incarceration is an atrocity.
For example, there is the Justice Collaborative, which, despite assisting the occasional awful prosecutor, employs dozens of sharp decarceration-focused lawyers with a tremendous amount of criminal litigation experience. Many of them are former public defenders who are also women of color. Justice Collaborative’s sister organization, The Appeal, has hosted Bernie Sanders himself on its webinars. And then there are plenty of more mainstream but creditable criminal justice reform organizations, like the Vera Institute for Justice, REFORM Alliance, #Cut50 and more.
If task force candidates from these organizations were absolute non-starters for presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, because they want to treat people who have committed crimes with too much human dignity, Sanders could instead have turned to an array of “progressive prosecutors.”
Top reform prosecutors like Larry Krasner (Philadelphia), Aramis Ayala (Orlando) and Rachael Rollins (Boston) would have almost certainly picked up the phone as a major political boost. Harris County (Houston), Texas District Attorney Kim Ogg is not that progressive at all—Sanders endorsed her socialist challenger Audia Jones this year—but still probably has more expertise and reformist accomplishments than some who made the cut.
Criminal justice reform always gets the short end of the political stick from national politicians, even those like Sanders. And people—especially people of color who have loved ones locked up for way too long on nonviolent crimes—are sick of it.
Filter asked Anrica Caldwell, whose fiancé David Barren received a sentence reduction from life-without-parole to 30 years in prison—for a nonviolent drug-law violation—for her view.
“People like me always vote with our conscience, on party lines, but when it comes to criminal justice reform, no one steps up to the plate,” she said.
“Some Republicans have delivered more when it comes to cutting the prison population,” Caldwell continued. “It is ironic for Democrats to speak about justice when we are simply suffocating from a lack of criminal justice reform. It’s never going to rise from the grave unless we enact real policy solutions coming from people who’ve experienced incarceration firsthand or lived through it with their loved ones.”

"Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and many of his administration’s policies have played on the trope of threats posed by refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/i-collected-the-data-and-trumps-new-travel-ban-has-little-to-do-with-national-security/,alternet,immigration,left,10.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Charles Kurzman, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Over the past two decades, how many people have been killed in the U.S. by extremists from the six countries on the Trump administration’s new travel ban list?
The answer is zero, according to data I have collected from Department of Justice records and other sources. Immigrants from these countries constitute less than 1% of terrorism cases in the United States, and none of the cases in the last two years.
The same is true for the original travel bans imposed in 2017. There were, and still are, zero fatalities in the United States caused by extremists from the countries on those lists, too.
One attempted attack in decades
Under the new ban, which begins on Feb. 22, citizens of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania will no longer be able to apply for immigrant visas.
The White House says these countries “must satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America’s law-enforcement and intelligence professionals” in order for the ban to be lifted.
However, there is no evidence that immigrants from these six countries pose a national security threat to the United States.
In fact, only one citizen from any of these countries has attempted a terrorist attack in the United States: 11 years ago, a man from Nigeria tried but failed to ignite explosives in his underwear as his flight approached Detroit. Nobody was injured, apart from the would-be bomber.
In recent years, Nigeria has “actively cooperated with the United States and other international partners” to prevent further attacks, according to a State Department report last October.
The new ban wouldn’t have stopped the underwear bomber, in any case, because he was traveling on a tourist visa, and the new ban applies only to immigrant visas.
Immigrant extremism versus domestic extremism
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and many of his administration’s policies have played on the trope of threats posed by refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants.
However, the administration’s own security agencies view homegrown and domestic terrorism as a greater threat than extremist violence by foreigners.
“We now assess the most predominant terrorist threat to the Homeland to emanate from U.S.-based lone actors,” the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center testified to Congress in November.
For more than a decade, under three administrations, the FBI’s annual briefing on worldwide terrorist threats has rated American extremism as a greater concern than foreign operatives. The director of the FBI repeated this point in congressional testimony several days after the new travel ban was announced.
The travel ban would not have prevented the country’s deadliest terrorist attacks in recent years, which were committed by right-wing Americans, not immigrants: the anti-immigrant extremist who killed 22 shoppers at a store in El Paso; the white supremacist who killed 17 students and teachers at a school in Parkland, Florida; or the anti-Semite who killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.
The travel ban also would not have prevented the most recent attack by a foreign national – the Saudi officer who killed three sailors at a naval air base in Pensacola. The officer did not arrive on an immigrant visa, and the ban specifically exempts Saudi Arabia.
Fanning fears
National security has a special status in government policy – policymakers are given extra leeway on security issues in order to safeguard against existential threats.
A generation ago, during the Cold War, those threats involved nuclear missiles and million-man armies. After 9/11, the primary threat was mass casualty attacks by nongovernmental organizations. Today, fortunately, those threats have diminished to the point that the latest National Security Strategy of the United States focuses on lone individuals with small arms, homemade explosives, vehicles and knives.
This violence is a concern, but not a leading threat to public safety. Terrorists were responsible for only one-fifth of 1% of the 290,000 murders in the United States since 9/11, according to data from the Global Terrorism Database and the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. The government’s counterterrorism dragnet, involving thousands of agents over many years, has discovered fewer and fewer plots in recent years.
Still, many Americans do not feel safe. Half of the respondents in recent surveys say they worry about being the victim of a terrorist attack.
Trump’s new travel ban asks Americans to believe that they will be more secure without immigration from Nigeria and five other countries. In my view, that is an insult both to those countries and to the country that calls itself the home of the brave.

The problem? Jeff Bezos is worth over $110 billion. Amazon is not just insanely profitable (thanks in part to worker conditions and business practices that are doing to the American workforce what mankind is doing to its namesake rain forest), but economy-bendingly, history-changingly successful.
The amount of $690,000, or One Million Australian Dollars, is the equivalent of Jeff Bezos sneezing pocket change out his nose and using Australia’s sleeve to wipe it up. It is the Amazon equivalent of sending a Hallmark card. By all means, charity is good and Amazon and other mega-corporations contributing anything to anyone is also good, but if the message was big corporations will take care of this it came off a bit more as big corporations will do the bare minimum required to get a momentary publicity hit.
By way of context, what Amazon, King of All Retailers, is spending to combat Australian fires is roughly on par with the money raised by a single California woman trading nudes for fire donations.
It is also on par with the $516,000 donation toward fighting Australian wildfires pledged by Metallica and a $1 million donation by Elton John.
Amazon may be attempting to make a public statement, but its CEO famously spent $250 million buying his own newspaper. So $690,000 won’t buy you a boat that most of the world’s billionaires would be caught dead on. Hell, $690,000 won’t even buy you a Silicon Valley house.
People can’t help but draw conclusions. A good one to draw might be “The charity of the top 0.1 percent and of corporations both are vastly overstated and not even fractionally as useful as simply taxing them at the same effective rate as the rest of us pay, so maybe we should get on with that already.”

Critics of the Trump administration’s immigration policies have said such policies violate migrants’ rights and further endanger them by making them wait in dangerous border towns or in one of the most violent countries in the world lacking robust asylum systems.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cbp-says-u-s-mexico-border-apprehensions-continue-decline-n1113011?cid=public-rss_20200109,msnbc,immigration,left,10.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
Customs and Border Protection said Thursday that border apprehensions dropped in December for the seventh month in a row.
U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 32,858 individuals crossing at the Southwest Border between ports of entry during the month of December, CBP said in a statement released Thursday morning. That number is down from 33,511 in November and 35,405 in October.

Meanwhile, CBP determined that 7,762 individuals were deemed inadmissible after presenting themselves at legal ports of entry along the southern in December. That statistic is a decline from 9,140 in November and 9,779 in October.
CBP said in a post on Twitter that December’s enforcement statistics, which include both apprehensions and those deemed inadmissible, were a five percent decrease compared to November and more than 70 percent lower than the peak of 144,000 combined in May of 2019.
Last fiscal year, 50,751 individuals were apprehended and 10,043 were deemed inadmissible between ports of entry in December.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said there is an ongoing “crisis” at the southern border and sought to deter migrants, many of whom were Central American families, from making the journey.
CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan said last month that the number of Central American families coming to the U.S. border has decreased, with a recent increase of apprehensions of Mexican migrants and single adults surpassing families.
Since last year, the Trump administration has been sending some asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their asylum cases play out and recently began sending some asylum-seekers to Guatemala.
Critics of the Trump administration’s immigration policies have said such policies violate migrants’ rights and further endanger them by making them wait in dangerous border towns or in one of the most violent countries in the world lacking robust asylum systems.","['dangerous', 'violent', 'robust', 'endanger']"
"Biden’s five picks are typical of centrists who want to trim the edges of our bloated, draconian justice system without changing anything systemically.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/there-are-troubling-signs-in-the-joint-bernie-biden-criminal-justice-task-force/,alternet,elections-2020,left,11.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In an attempt to unite the centrist and progressive wings of the Democratic Party, presumptive 2020 presidential nominee Joe Biden and runner-up Bernie Sanders put together six “unity task forces” to shape policies, with the following respective areas of focus: climate change, education, the economy, healthcare, immigration and criminal justice reform. For each task force, reports Vox, Biden got five picks and Sanders three.
This is a positive for the party’s electoral prospects, after a bitterly fragmented primary. Unfortunately, the people selected for the task forces demonstrate how not only the party establishment, but even an insurgent progressive like Sanders, privilege certain topics over others. The criminal justice reform task force is incredibly milquetoast.
While status quo-shattering progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) are included on the climate change and healthcare committees, respectively, not a single person in the criminal justice reform group brings comparable strength of ideas or clout.
Biden’s five picks are typical of centrists who want to trim the edges of our bloated, draconian justice system without changing anything systemically.
Two are top members of the Obama Department of Justice (DOJ): former Attorney General Eric Holder and former acting assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta. While these figures supported deprioritizing federal enforcement of anti-marijuana laws and expressed some dismay toward the harshest mandatory minimum prison sentences for drugs, they did little to address federal prosecutors’ complete lack of accountability—due to secrecy and their near-unlimited discretion, which they often use to push for very harsh sentences to match the non-mandatory US Sentencing Guidelines.
Biden also chose Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), who has a fairly decent track record on opposing mandatory minimums. But Rep. Scott is still a far cry from a fellow Congressional moderate who was not selected: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who has proposed the return of federal parole and other sweeping changes. To round out his side of the table, Biden chose Raumesh Akbari, a state senator from Tennessee who has accomplished virtually nothing to decarcerate at home, and Symone Sanders, a political aide who defended Biden’s pro-mass incarceration past and has narrow professional experience in this area.
Reformers expected Biden to be weak on decarceration, considering he promulgated the noxious 1994 Crime Bill, among other stains on his record, and has shown little interest in mass incarceration outside of maintaining it.
But Sanders’ picks are where things get devastatingly disappointing.
It’s 2020, not 1990. Even setting aside the many non-law enforcement options for a moment, Sanders had dozens of relatively progressive elected prosecutors to choose from if he wished to balance credibility with moderates with the need for real change. Sanders is familiar with at least several of them, having personally endorsed them.
Yet instead, he appointed three ineffective, unambitious choices: Chiraag Bains of Demos, a small center-left think tank; South Carolina State Representative Justin Bamberg; and Linn County, Iowa Supervisor Stacey Walker.
First things first, Sanders was good to his people—Bamberg was an endorser in 2016 (though he originally backed Hillary Clinton), and Walker worked his Iowa campaign.

However, many common nonviolent drug felonies are so-called “unclassified” felonies under South Carolina law, placing them into the current “no parole” offense category. Bamberg’s bill gives credence to this bogus idea, noting that people serving time on current “no parole” felonies—like most meth charges, or an 18-year-old sharing heroin with a 17-year-old—would have to serve fully 65 percent of their sentence in prison, and face intensive supervision until the 85 percent threshold is hit. Knowing that his parole reform bill would not pass through a Republican-dominated legislature in the Deep South anyway, Bamberg might still have addressed this as a symbolic gesture.
Meanwhile, Iowa’s Stacey Walker has no substantive criminal justice experience on his resume. Some of his career is certainly admirable, such as his work to help at-risk kids graduate high school. But it seems his most noteworthy criminal justice accomplishment was putting implicit bias training for county prosecutors on the agenda, much to his county attorney’s laughable chagrin.

"Facebook, YouTube and Amazon all answered with policy changes, removing some fear-mongering content related to vaccines.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/moms-go-undercover-fight-fake-autism-cures-private-facebook-groups-n1007871,msnbc,vaccines,left,11.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"When they aren’t working or taking care of their autistic children, Melissa Eaton and Amanda Seigler are moles.
Eaton, 39, a single mother from Salisbury, North Carolina, and Seigler, 38, a mom to six in Lake Worth, Florida, have spent much of their free time in the last three years infiltrating more than a dozen private Facebook groups for parents of autistic kids. In some of these groups, members describe using dubious, dangerous methods to try to “heal” their children’s autism — a condition with no medically known cause or cure.
The parents in many of these groups, which have ranged from tens to tens of thousands of members, believe that autism is caused by a hodgepodge of phenomena, including viruses, bacteria, fungal infections, parasites, heavy metal poisoning from vaccines, general inflammation, allergies, gluten and even the moon.
The so-called treatments are equally confused. Some parents credit turpentine or their children’s own urine as the secret miracle drug for reversing autism. One of the most sought-after chemicals is chlorine dioxide — a compound that the Food and Drug Administration warns amounts to industrial bleach, and doctors say can cause permanent harm. Parents still give it to their children orally, through enemas, and in baths. Proponents of chlorine dioxide profit off these parents’ fears and hopes by selling books about the supposed “cure,” marketing the chemicals and posting how-to videos.

“It really weighs on you, but kids are being abused,” Eaton said. “You see it. You have the choice of doing something about it or letting it go. And I’m not the kind of person who can see something like that and just forget about it.”
To gain entrance to these groups, Eaton and Seigler disguise themselves as desperate parents looking for answers to their child’s autism. Once they’re in, they take screenshots of posts from parents who describe giving these chemicals to their children, often with disastrous results.
“My son is constantly making a gasping sound,” posted one Kansas mother who claimed to treat her adult son with chlorine dioxide, according to screenshots shared by Eaton and Seigler. “He won’t open his mouth,” a Canadian mom wrote of her 2-year-old’s unwillingness to drink the chlorine dioxide. “He screams. Spits. Flips over.”
Amanda Seigler Courtesy of Amanda Seigler
Horrified by the treatment of these children, Eaton and Seigler research the parents online to determine their identity and location, then send screenshots of the Facebook posts to the local Child Protective Services division, though they rarely hear back on whether action was taken. The pair say they’ve reported over 100 parents since 2016. They also report the posts to Facebook and have submitted their findings to the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Justice and child abuse organizations.
Recently, the tide has begun to turn in their favor.
Over the past year, amid growing mistrust of big tech — as well as rising concern about anti-vaccine misinformation during a resurgence of measles — lawmakers and health advocates have turned up pressure on Facebook and other companies to stop the viral spread of harmful anti-vaccination propaganda and similar health misinformation on their platforms.
Facebook, YouTube and Amazon all answered with policy changes, removing some fear-mongering content related to vaccines. Those crackdowns also swept up content related to faux autism cures, including chlorine dioxide.
But problems persist. For every book removed from Amazon or private group shuttered on Facebook, others spring up. And proponents of chlorine dioxide are finding new corners of the internet to colonize, where their most loyal followers — parents desperate for a cure for the incurable — will continue to find them.
That means Eaton and Seigler still have plenty of work to do.
“The lack of action by platforms has turned all of us into content moderators,” said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center.
“We are all growing weary of the platform companies’ inability to squash illicit, illegal and harassing behavior online,” Donovan continued, referring to issues ranging from anti-vaccine misinformation campaigns to mass shootings live-streamed on the platforms. “It goes back to their dogmatic belief in openness as an unmitigated social good. It’s damaging to have health misinformation spread at such a huge scale.”
Inside the investigations
Childhood rates of autism have risen sharply over the last decade, affecting 1 in 59 children in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors are unable to offer parents a cure, and increasingly, parents turn to social media for answers.
Seigler was searching Facebook for information about her son’s autism diagnosis in 2015 when she learned about the chlorine dioxide groups.
“It went through my mind: What if someone tried to do that to my children?” said Seigler, a veterinary technician and mother to three biological children and adoptive mother to three of her husband’s minor siblings.
Now Seigler — who sees autism as a different way of being, not a disease to be cured — spends at least three days a week scouring Facebook for these posts, trying to stop what she has reported to local authorities as the abuse of autistic children.
“I do it at night,” Seigler said. “I don’t want to expose my children to this world while I’m reporting. After they go to bed, I go online.”
Eaton, whose husband died in 2011, fits in the sleuthing during the day, when her son is at school and she’s not working her loss-prevention job at a burglar alarm company.
The groups are filled with parents who say they have tried treating their children with chlorine dioxide.
“Have not been able to get 5 year old to cooperate with enemas,” a Massachusetts mother complained, according to a screenshot provided by Eaton and Seigler, who work together in their investigating.
One Georgia mother posted a photo of a long thread of what looks like mucus that she said dislodged after giving her autistic son a chlorine dioxide emema. In the caption, she wrote, “It broke in half when Jojo trying to escape.”

NBC News reached out to each of the parents behind the posts but did not receive any responses.
The worst part is the comments, which suggest that the children’s adverse reactions are just proof that the chlorine dioxide is working, Eaton and Seigler said.
Eaton and Seigler often do their work with little sense of whether they’re making a difference. State privacy laws mean they don’t hear back on most of their child abuse reports, and federal agencies have been hesitant to act on their tips, often claiming a lack of jurisdiction or evidence, according to emails viewed by NBC News. The Department of Justice declined to comment, and the FDA did not respond to a request for comment. And for years, until the recent crackdown on health misinformation groups, Eaton said, Facebook simply replied with a “blanket statement that it doesn’t violate their policy.”
It’s not just Facebook. Evangelists for dubious autism cures have long relied on Amazon and eBay to sell their books and chemicals like chlorine dioxide, YouTube to share their how-to videos, and Skype and other social media to spread the word to their millions of followers — adherents who take to all these platforms to profess their devotion.
“It’s like a cult,” Seigler said.
The origins of a dangerous 'cure'
Chlorine dioxide — a hazardous mix of sodium chlorite and an acid activator such as citric acid — was first promoted as a miracle cure two decades ago by Jim Humble, a former Scientologist and gold prospector.
Humble, 86, claimed he’d used the chemical compound to heal a case of malaria while on a South American expedition. It worked so well, Humble says in his book and on his website, that he named himself the archbishop of a new religion devoted to chlorine dioxide, branded it the Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS for short, and promoted it as a cure for AIDS, cancer, diabetes and virtually every other malady. Humble did not respond to a request for comment.
But it was Kerri Rivera, a former Chicago real estate agent, who brought chlorine dioxide to the autism community and became its best-known proponent.

As she tells it in her 2013 book, “Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism,” Rivera, who is not a doctor, stumbled across Humble’s teachings while experimenting with autism cures on her son. Rivera had made contacts in the autism cure world by trying different en vogue regimens like hyperbaric chambers and heavy metal antidotes.
“Disappointingly, there was absolutely nothing on the Internet about autism and Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS),” Rivera wrote in her book.
Rivera changed that, laying out the particulars of her chlorine dioxide protocol in her book, which she promoted on her website, in Facebook groups and in YouTube videos. Rivera created a line of supplements and built a consultation business through Facebook and Skype to bring the “treatment” to all autistic children, all while traveling the autism cure circuit, where parents attending autism and anti-vaccination conferences received her as a savior. Today, she lives and operates a clinic offering chlorine dioxide regimens in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and claims to have cured autism in more than 500 children.
The ingredients that make up Rivera’s chlorine dioxide protocol aren’t illegal — sodium chlorite and acid are used together for purposes outside of human consumption like bleaching paper and for wastewater treatments — so regulation of its sale is nearly impossible. But it is illegal under both federal and state consumer protection laws to market or sell chlorine dioxide as a cure for human ailments. After inquiries from the Illinois attorney general’s office in 2015, Rivera agreed not to conduct seminars or sell products in the state.
""This stuff does nothing other than introduce potential risk."" Dr. Daniel Brooks
Rivera declined to be interviewed by NBC News, but in emails she defended chlorine dioxide and her credentials. “This is a medical issue. I have a degree in homeopathy and work with MDs and PhD scientists,” she wrote. Rivera did not respond to requests for more information about these doctors and the institution that granted her degree.
Doctors warn chlorine dioxide could do irreparable harm to a child’s body, by damaging tissues in the digestive system and wreaking havoc on red blood cells.
“It can lead to kidney damage and kidney failure,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director at Banner University Medical Center’s Poison and Drug Information Center and Outpatient Toxicology Clinic in Phoenix. He called its use to treat autism “ludicrous.”
“This stuff does nothing other than introduce potential risk,” Brooks said.
In a video, Rivera scoffs at doctors’ warnings: “If it’s deadly, we would see dead people.”
In fact, we do. In the last five years, poison control centers have managed 16,521 cases nationwide dealing with chlorine dioxide, according to data provided by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Approximately 2,500 of those cases involved children under 12; it’s not clear how many of those children were autistic.
The data showed serious side effects from chlorine dioxide poisoning in 2,123 cases since 2014. Fifty of those cases were considered life-threatening, and eight people died.
A review of a separate database, the Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System, found eight cases of serious injuries from chlorine dioxide since 2004. The cases included a 6-year-old autistic girl hospitalized with liver failure in 2017.
‘She wasn't listening to anybody'
In 2018, Jose Serrano called the Indianapolis police department to complain for the second time in weeks that his wife was making their 2-year-old daughter drink a chlorine dioxide solution in an attempt to cure her autism. Police responded by calling the state’s Child Protective Services division, who removed the child from her mother’s home.
Serrano, 29, who was separated from his wife at the time, told NBC News that she had been secretly dosing their daughter in the bathroom to hide it from him and the rest of her family, who all disapproved.
“She was just frustrated with the autism,” Serrano said.
She learned about the concoction in a Facebook group, according to the police report.
""She wasn't listening to anybody,” Serrano said. “When we found out, we told her, her brothers told her. I don't know if she's still in her delusional world. But she's always looking for the solution.""
Serrano currently has custody of his daughter, now 3. It took a few months for a full-body rash, the only side effect he saw from the chlorine dioxide, to go away, he said.
“She has autism. But it is going to get better,” Serrano said. “She's improved a lot. She says some words here and there. But I know it’s going to take a long time.""
When reached by phone, Serrano’s ex-wife, who has not been charged with a crime and spoke on the condition that she not be named out of concern for her privacy, said she regretted trying to cure her daughter’s autism with chlorine dioxide. “I love my daughter and having her with me is the most important thing,” she said.
A series of purges
Emma Dalmayne was among the first and remains one of the loudest disability rights advocates to fight against harmful autism “cures.” A London mother to autistic children and autistic herself, Dalmayne has railed against dangerous treatments like chlorine dioxide since 2015. It was Dalmayne who inspired Eaton and Seigler by first infiltrating Rivera’s groups and making videos exposing parents who treated their children with chlorine dioxide.
In 2018, prompted by a series of articles in the British tabloid Daily Mirror that were informed by Dalmayne, Facebook closed several of Rivera’s pages and groups with thousands of followers. But administrators for the banned groups, including Rivera, simply created new private groups, and more carefully vetted would-be members.
“The problem is if you manage to get one knocked down, it reopens the next day but it goes secret,” Dalmayne said. “So unless you've got a good fake profile, which I have, and you're friends with people in these groups who will tell you where the next secret group has opened, you can't report them. A lot of them I'm not in and we’ll never know about.”
A more serious round of purges started in March, when Amazon took the unusual step of banning Rivera’s book and an autism “cure” book by another author. Amazon declined to elaborate on the ban, which came one day after a Wired article criticized Amazon for selling autism cure books. Rivera said in an email to NBC News that the removal of her book would “decrease public awareness” of her message and that Amazon was “responding to media-generated hysteria.”
Days later, YouTube began deleting dozens of Rivera’s videos and channels, which featured interviews with parents and explainers for mixing and administering chlorine dioxide. A representative for Google, which owns YouTube, said the chlorine dioxide content, which also included a channel not run by Rivera, had been removed because it violated standards against “content intended to encourage dangerous activities that have an inherent risk of physical harm.”
Yahoo followed in April, canceling Rivera’s longtime email account. Eaton had emailed and called the company’s press, legal and law enforcement departments to inform them that Rivera was using the account for her chlorine dioxide business. Yahoo did not respond to a request for comment.
The biggest blow came in April, when Facebook deleted Rivera’s public profile, a page for her books with over 3,600 followers and a secret group with about 550 members. “Facebook wants to destroy our autism self-help community,” Rivera wrote in a newsletter to her followers after the crackdown. “Now 31,000 families that came to this page for advice, questions and solace have in essence been kicked off Facebook.”
A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News that Rivera’s groups were removed for violating Facebook’s rules on “nonmedical drugs,” which forbid content that promotes drug sales or describes personal drug use outside of recovery.
“We believe in giving people a voice, but we also want everyone using Facebook to feel safe,” the company spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News.
An uphill fight
Because of Facebook and YouTube’s whack-a-mole style of enforcement, in which users are rarely banned even if their groups are closed, Rivera’s content is still easy to find on the platforms. Rivera still has a personal Facebook account, a professional page and other groups dedicated to a separate diet brand, which she uses to sell supplements and promote her autism cure website. Rivera also still has a YouTube account and numerous conspiracy channels have featured interviews with her in the last month.
Rivera tried to move her chlorine dioxide groups from Facebook to MeWe, a less user-friendly group chat service billed by fringe groups and some conservatives as the answer to censorship from tech companies. But the 100 or so members of Rivera’s MeWe group miss the community they made on Facebook, which had five times as many members.
When a MeWe moderator asked what Rivera thought of the new setup, Rivera replied, “Insane.”
Meanwhile, Eaton and Seigler are watching MeWe, as well as Rivera’s Facebook pages, for signs of new groups targeting parents of autistic kids.
“Her profile needs to go and they need to ban her IP address,” Eaton said, adding that Rivera’s remaining accounts have allowed her to warn followers about upcoming bans and tell them how to skirt them.
“I’m also trying to work and take care of my family,” Eaton said. “It shouldn’t be on the public to try and handle this.”",['fear-mongering']

"Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/why-trump-is-so-eager-to-bring-back-professional-sports/,alternet,sport,left,11.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As controversies about the “reopening” of America loom over our lives, nothing seems as intrinsically irrelevant — yet possibly as critically important — as how soon major spectator sports return.
If sports don’t trump religion as the opiate of the masses, they have, until recently, been at least the background music of most of our lives. So here’s my bet on one possible side effect of the Covid-19 pandemic to put in your scorebook: if the National Football League plays regular season games this fall, President Trump stands a good chance of winning reelection for returning America to business as usual — or, at least, to his twisted version of the same.
That’s why he announced at a recent daily coronavirus briefing-cum-rally his eagerness to bring professional sports back quickly. Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old” — the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.
Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season — already poisoned by last year’s Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal — is up for grabs. Certainly, the proposed plan to turn stadiums in the Phoenix, Arizona, area into the sports equivalent of a vast movie set for the games of all 30 major league teams (to be played without fans) seems far-fetched at best.
But football, now the true national pastime, is another matter.
In sports terms, as in so much else in coronaviral America, these are desperately deprived times, even for casual fans. There will be intense pressure — and not only from the president’s base — for that sport’s return. For many people, mostly men, it’s the sustaining soap opera that has always carried them into the next week and the one after that, a porn-ish escape hatch from work and family, a currency of communication with other men, an eternal connection to a non-demanding hive.
Games for Lives?
Without professional (or even college) sports right now or realistically in the near future, fans feel even more unmoored in lives that, for all of us, are distinctly adrift. As they become edgier, it’s a reasonable bet (or at least my hope) that they will also become more open to questioning Trump’s mismanagement — or, to put it more bluntly, sacrifice — of their lives. Recent polls already seem to reflect this, with the latest Gallup Poll showing the steepest approval decline of his presidency.
The president, I suspect, fears just this, though perhaps, in the end, the hole in everyday life where sports once was may only reinforce fans’ sense (like the president’s) that the games are too important not to bring back, safety be damned. Certainly, Trump and other Republican politicians have already been willing enough to forfeit lives to boost their reelection chances.
The values and sensibilities of football are, of course, Trumpist in nature. That’s why former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s demonstration against racism — performed in a kind of public isolation — elicited such a harsh reaction from the president in the now-distant pre-pandemic era. That’s why the sport’s billionaire owners, predominantly Trump donors, shunned Kaepernick (although some of their teams could have used his skills). They didn’t dare to, or care to, give him another platform, not in an era when “president” and “racism” were becoming synonymous.
Even more tellingly, in an understandable but still disappointing me-first display, few of Kaepernick’s fellow players, most of whom are also African-American, supported him publicly. After years of being celebrated as America’s “warriors” and “role models,” they came up desperately short when it counted. Compare them to healthcare workers and other front-line heroes of this pandemic and you’ll realize just how far short they fell of even the most modest form of everyday bravery.
Not that, when it comes to pro sports, football was such an outlier. As activism goes, baseball, a sport that once produced transcendent progressive heroes like Jackie Robinson, Jim Bouton, and Curt Flood, has been eerily quiet in recent years. It’s a sport that the president has paid relatively little attention to — except for suggesting recently that Pete Rose, banned from baseball for life for betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was that team’s manager, should be allowed into its Hall of Fame.
How Trumpian was that? Such betting is, of course, strictly forbidden for active players and managers who are obviously privy to inside information. But, hey, does disregarding inconvenient rules to profit from a privileged position ring any bells these days in Washington?
Trump has, in fact, been uncharacteristically silent on the recent revelation that during the 2017 season, the World Series winners, the Houston Astros, concealed a video camera in center field to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams. That’s also illegal. Major League baseball punished the team by suspending its manager and general manager for a year, imposing a $5 million fine on its owners, and taking away its first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021.
For some fans and commentators, the Astros’ punishment was too severe or too mild. Opposing players, feeling victimized by the scheme, thought specific Astros should have been penalized, too. Yet such cheating is hardly new. In 1951, the “shot heard round the world,” a famed home-run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and sent them to the World Series, was linked to the stealing of signs from the Brooklyn Dodgers through a hand-held telescope. Only the technology has improved.
A Changing National Pastime
Once baseball’s opening day passed without a pitch this April, proof that the plague was winning, the Phoenix Plan was floated. It would require all major league players and employees to be sequestered in that area and continually tested at a moment when tests might still not be universally available. But, hey, haven’t VIP Jocks always gone to the head of the line? (Actually, a massive study of 10,000 Major League Baseball employees, from players to popcorn vendors, being conducted by Stanford University and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory to find out how many contracted and may have recovered from the virus has already gotten access to such testing kits at a time when even some front-line workers can’t get them!)
For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As the country reeled from the revelation of President Bill Clinton’s sexual liaison with a White House intern and with his impeachment just around the corner, a feel-good legend was born. A white man and a brown man rose in friendly rivalry to break the 37-year-old record of 61 home runs by Roger Maris, who, in turn, had bested Babe Ruth’s famed 60 in 1927.
The good-natured competition between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (who won with 70 homers) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs (66) was, at the time, celebrated as a balm that should soothe the country. And perhaps for many fans it did indeed serve as a comforting distraction in a difficult political moment.
But that summer’s golden glow soon faded as both players were reported to have taken steroids to muscle up. McGwire would admit it years later; Sosa would not. (A dark-skinned Dominican, he further complicated his legend by bleaching his skin to whiten himself, as if in anticipation of the Trumpian racial preferences to come.) Their contemporary, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, would eventually become the single-season home run leader with 73, but has never shaken rumors that he, too, used steroids.
Nor did baseball ever fully recover its sense of primacy as the national pastime or its sense of righteousness as one of America’s first major institutions to integrate. In fact, the sport is still overwhelmingly white and skewed toward an older audience, as well as slow and outdated in an era of tweeting speed.
Which is why, whether or not baseball opens this season in a vast sports self-isolation experiment, the key to President Trump’s future lies in his perverse relationship with the National Football League. That goes back more than 30 years to the moment he tried unsuccessfully (as with so many other business ventures) to elbow his way into the sport. Give him credit, though: ever attuned to the public mood, he did sense the rise of a new national pastime.
Bet On This
One reason for the NFL’s growing popularity is the way it uses college football as its minor leagues and early showcase for pro players (though possibly not this fall). For a passionate pro football fan, it’s a pleasure to see the stars of tomorrow in the making. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. In a recent commentary in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Nathan Kalman-Lamb of Duke opines that high-revenue men’s football and basketball “will become more valuable than ever as an enticement to lure steep tuition from students.”
And here’s an innovation that the president would glory in, one that would make post-pandemic football an even greater success: the addition of real-time nationwide legal gambling on games. Just imagine the sort of Trump-donor dollars that would be stacked up to support such a future industry. After all, estimations are that illegal gambling on pro and college football is already a $93 billion business. Legal or not, it’s an integral part of the fan experience (though in the post-pandemic world there will be a lot less money in so many pockets to gamble with).
The dream of easily accessible, high-tech legal gambling has been lurking on the sidelines for years. All that’s necessary to make it come true is for Congress to reverse the 1992 Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act, the federal law that bans it in most states. And the pandemic moment may prove perfect for just that, for “reopening” football in a new and even more Trumpian way, allowing fans to sit at home and bet what money they have left on games in progress: Will that field goal attempt split the uprights? Will Tom Brady in his new Tampa Bay Buccaneers uniform make that crucial third-down conversion?
However, to reopen pro football, as the president would wish, to make life seem “normal” again, stadiums might have to remain empty (or partially empty). Imagine, for instance, if San Francisco had actually beaten Kansas City (which it didn’t) in the Super Bowl on the first Sunday in February and the expected championship parade had followed a few days later, drawing a million people to that city’s streets. It might have proved an early version of Mardi Gras (a 2020 coronaviral disaster of a get-together).
Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. From the huddle to tackling, the game is, in every way, a potential disease transmitter. The only example of social distancing (besides Kaepernick kneeling alone) I can even remember might have been the 1958 West Point football team, which fielded a “lonesome end,” Bill Carpenter. On every play, he set himself up near the far sideline in an innovative formation. He never even joined the huddle and that team went undefeated.
If it proves impossible to stage football games, given social-distancing rules, the inevitable sport of the future is already waiting in the wings. Just under the radar of most of the middle-aged and elderly, especially those without access to children, is a fiercely contested, already commodified, fan-friendly industry with championships, heroes, endorsement contracts, and a ready market for expensive gear. I’m thinking, as you may have guessed, of competitive online video games, or esports. (Think of it as the revenge of the nerds.) No matter what Donald Trump does, sooner rather than later they’re likely to replace the old up-close-and-contagious live games.
It’s not hard to imagine a future in which individual competitors, regional and national teams, leagues, or even some version of the Olympics, would be watched by millions on streaming platforms on home screens and, once social distancing becomes a historical footnote, on the screens of sports bars as well, if not theaters and arenas. While combat games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, along with sports knock-offs like Madden and NBA Live, currently dominate esports, the future will undoubtedly include brainier fare that will turn art, architecture, banking, diplomacy, music, and maybe even poetry into online competitions even Nike and Google could sponsor.
Esports already supports ESPN-style commentary. There might even be room someday for a new reality show about them hosted by a motor-mouthed, pumpkin-headed former one-term president.
Who needs football after all? It would, in fact, be the definition of madness to launch a football season in a coronaviral world. But that doesn’t mean Donald Trump won’t push for just that. The advisory board he appointed for the reopening of sports includes, as my colleague Dave Zirin points out, “a group of brigands defined by their lack of care in normal times for the safety and well-being of their employees.”
It’s Trump’s dream team because, to win in November, he needs an America in which the National Football League is back in business big time. For him it’s open arms for the NFL, which could mean open season on the rest of us.

Even though Thunberg is capable of doing things many on the right refuse to do — such as read and understand scientific evidence — right-wingers argued that Thunberg and her fellow youth activists cannot think for themselves.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/why-theyre-scared-of-greta-thunberg-right-wingers-cant-deny-this-climate-activists-truth-in-desperation-theyre-resorting-to-malice-bigotry-and-lies/,alternet,environment,left,12.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt of this. The modern-day conservative was revealed, in all his glory, as a weak-minded coward who hides behind unearned privileges, because he is incapable of handling a fair-minded debate, much less real moral accountability.
Thunberg’s trip to the U.S. for the UN Climate Action Summit had, before this week, already been a remarkable success. The 16-year-old’s steely-eyed courage has helped inspire kids across the country — and the world — to join her call to strike from school last week and stand up for more aggressive action to combat the climate crisis.
On Monday, Thunberg finally gave her speech before the UN and, for those who haven’t yet seen it, it was a doozy. She accused world leaders of betrayal and warned that the “eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.”
(As a note: Yes, you can read a transcript of the speech, but it really helps to watch the video, because Thunberg’s passion and clarity is powerful and sobering.)
Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say. Even though Thunberg is capable of doing things many on the right refuse to do — such as read and understand scientific evidence — the argument is that Thunberg and her fellow youth activists cannot think for themselves.
On Fox News, Michael Knowles of the right-wing outlet Daily Wire, in full grumpy-old-man mode, described Thunberg on Monday as “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” a statement so ugly that even the network was forced to denounce it.
It’s a bit unclear, however, what Fox News was apologizing for, since Knowles’ argument is just a blunter version of what all their pundits have said about Thunberg.
Laura Ingraham compared Thunberg and other climate activists to “Children of the Corn,” a Stephen King story about children brainwashed into a murderous cult.
Industry-backed climate change denier Marc Morano argued that Thunberg is “causing and instilling fear in millions of kids around the world,” as if the anxiety were anything but a rational reaction to real world events. He also compared climate science to “medieval witchcraft.”
The New York Times, in a stunning demonstration of bad judgment, let climate-change denier Christopher Caldwell write an op-ed complaining that “a 16-year-old is not a legally responsible adult,” and trying to discredit her by saying “she is diminutive and fresh-faced, comes off as younger than her years.”
Of course, Donald Trump had to get in on the action, talking down to Thunberg with a sarcastic tweet that was the equivalent of telling her she’d be pretty if she smiled more.
All of these attacks say almost about Thunberg or the other kids — some as young as elementary age — who have correctly called out adults for failing to do more to slow climate change.
These attacks speak to conservatives’ dependence on irrational social hierarchies that determine who is “right” or “wrong” not by virtue of evidence or reason, but based on who has more social power due to age, gender or social class. Thunberg and her youth activist cohort strike fear into the hearts of right-wingers precisely because they have uncovered the lie that age automatically grants wisdom.
Just by doing her thing, Thunberg has exposed the way climate-change deniers hide behind their unearned privileges to assert themselves as authorities on a topic where they are literally denying basic scientific facts. To borrow Morano’s metaphor, climate-change deniers are reminiscent of witch hunters in the past, who hid behind the Bible and the authority of their gender in order to persecute innocent women.
When liberals understandably lashed out at these insipid, ad hominem attacks against Thunberg, some conservatives shifted their tactics towards false claims that Thunberg and her allies are hiding behind her age, using youth as a shield from criticism. Professional troll Charlie Kirk added a charge of hypocrisy, since those same liberals who were supposedly claiming that you “can’t” criticize a 16-year-old also criticized a group of high school kids in January who were videotaped in MAGA hats acting like jackasses after an anti-choice protest in Washington.
The same people who say we can’t criticize 16-year old ANTIFA climate activist Greta Von Thunburg …Spent months shamelessly attacking the Covington Catholic High School kids—just because they supported our president 🤔 — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 23, 2019
This would be an argument, I guess, if anyone was actually assert a blanket “you can’t criticize kids” argument. In reality, criticizing the Covington students and supporting Greta Thunberg share a common assumption, which is the exact opposite of Kirk’s claim. In both cases, teenagers are fledgling moral actors, and, as such, deserve to be taken seriously when they make political statements.
In fact, there’s an entirely consistent argument here. The Covington were old enough to be held responsible for their actions. Greta Thunberg is old enough to be considered a rational actor whose arguments hold weight.
To put it another way, no one is saying you can’t criticize a teenager. But the “criticisms” of Thunberg are nothing more than ad hominem attacks and vitriol, thrown out there in a desperate attempt to hide the fact that the right has no substantive argument on the climate crisis.
We saw the right pulling the same trick with the Parkland kids, pretending that liberals were “using” the students for nefarious political purposes. In fact, young people are standing up on issues like climate and guns for the simple reason that they are the people most under threat.
Conservatives are, as usual, the ones being inconsistent here. When kids express right-wing views, they are assumed by conservatives to be responsible actors thinking for themselves. able to think for themselves. When they support progressive or liberal causes, they are accused of being puppets. The fairest response is to see both conservative and liberal kids as responsible for their own opinions, and to give credit or condemnation appropriately.
Ultimately, it’s good to see grown men so afraid of a teenage girl speaking truth to power. It’s a reminder that conservatives know, on some level, that their authority is a house of cards, and that they don’t deserve all the deference they get simply by being white, male or old. Thunberg represents the possibility of looking past rules that treat young women as inherently inferior and not worthy of respect. She demands that we take people’s arguments and beliefs seriously, instead of dismissing them based on perceptions rooted in identity. Conservatives understand one thing clearly —they will not do well in a world where what you say and do matters more than who you are.","['understand', 'right-wingers']"
"Threre are some concerns about whether some of the goals set by the Green New Deal are realistic, but to argue that the blueprint is genocidal is hopelessly bonkers.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/leading-house-republican-equates-green-new-deal-and-genocide,msnbc,environment,left,12.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"When it comes to the Green New Deal blueprint to address the climate crisis, Republicans generally like to pretend it calls for the elimination of hamburgers. (It does not.) But Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) went quite a bit further this week.
“For many people who live in the West, but also in rural and urban areas, the ideas behind the Green New Deal are tantamount to genocide,” the Republican congressman said at a press conference. “That may be an overstatement, but not by a whole lot.”
A reporter from Axios caught up with Bishop after the event to clarify matters a bit.
AXIOS: Genocide is defined as “the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.” How is the Green New Deal like genocide? BISHOP: I’m an ethnic. I’m a westerner. AXIOS: And you think the Green New Deal is going to kill you? BISHOP: If you actually implement everything they want to. Killing would be positive if you implement everything the Green New Deal actually wants to. That’s why the Green New Deal is not ready for prime time.
For the record, it’s important to emphasize that Rob Bishop isn’t just some random conservative personality, saying odd things in the media. Rather, the Utah Republican is a nine-term Republican – whom GOP leaders named as the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee.
Indeed, up until a few months ago, Bishop chaired the panel, where he spearheaded an effort to invalidate the Endangered Species Act.
And yet, he’ll apparently now be famous for something altogether different.
The Utahan’s argument is a tough one to unpack, since it’s so needlessly over the top. I have some concerns about whether some of the goals set by the Green New Deal are realistic, but to argue that the blueprint is genocidal is hopelessly bonkers.
It’s not homicidal, either. Bishop is apparently under the impression that the proposal would kill him if the plan is “actually implemented,” but that in no way reflects reality.
There’s also the congressman’s claim that he’s “an ethnic,” which is why he believes its responsible to say the Green New Deal is “tantamount to genocide.” I’m at a loss to understand how the GOP lawmaker would even define “ethnic.”
But as the debate over solutions to the climate crisis continues, and the public looks to policymakers to work cooperatively, it’s worth keeping in mind that Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee will be expected to find common ground with Rob Bishop.","['bonkers', 'hopelessly']"

"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will give an Oval Office address on the government shutdown he created, during which he presumably will lie through his teeth to defend his highly unpopular immigration agenda.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/tv-networks-will-let-trump-use-prime-time-to-talk-about-immigration-heres-what-they-did-when-obama-tried-it/,alternet,immigration,left,12.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will give an Oval Office address on the government shutdown he created, during which he presumably will lie through his teeth to defend his highly unpopular immigration agenda. And the network channels — ABC, CBS, and NBC — are planning to air footage of it in primetime.
It is always infuriating when reporters give the president an open mic to ramble without fact-checking. But even more problematic than this, as Vox points out, is that in 2014, President Barack Obama addressed the nation during primetime to discuss his executive orders protecting young immigrants, and the networks all refused to air the address on the grounds that it would be too partisan:
Conservative pundits were, at the time, pushing the notion that Obama was essentially seizing power like a Latin American dictator, so essentially anything that refocused the conversation on banal policy details would have played to his advantage. TV networks, however, didn’t give him what he wanted, in part because it was November sweeps time, but officially because he was playing partisan politics rather than addressing a true national emergency.
Moreover, Vox notes, the networks did give airtime to President George W. Bush in 2006 to discuss immigration — and his position was essentially the same as Obama’s. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the networks are simply more willing to give Republicans the floor than Democrats, which is also backed up by the heavy imbalance towards conservatives in Sunday talk show lineups.
This fact is clearly not lost on congressional Democrats, who, according to The Hill, are demanding networks give them time to respond to the president’s speech.
“Now that the television networks have decided to air the President’s address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in a joint statement on Monday.
If the media allows Trump a free platform to lie with no consequences, the downward spiral of our public discourse will continue, and public confidence in the media will only be undermined and give way to greater partisanship.","['unpopular', 'lie', 'through', 'his', 'teeth', 'highly']"
"Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-brutalizing-protesters-would-save-him-he-was-wrong/,alternet,elections-2020,left,13.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['divisive', 'buffoon', 'incompetent', 'cynically']"

Protests against state stay-at-home orders have attracted a wide range of fringe activists and ardent Trump supporters. They have also attracted a family of political activists whom some Republican lawmakers have called ""scam artists.""
A family-run network of pro-gun groups is behind five of the largest Facebook groups dedicated to protesting the shelter-in-place restrictions, according to an NBC News analysis of Facebook groups and website registration information.
The groups were set up by four brothers — Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew Dorr — and have amassed more than 200,000 members collectively, including in states where they don't reside, according to an NBC News analysis based on public records searches and Facebook group registrations.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
The Dorr brothers are known in conservative circles for running pro-gun and anti-abortion rights Facebook groups that bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars annually by antagonizing establishment conservative leaders and activists.
Their usual method is to attack established conservative groups from the right, including the National Rifle Association, and then make money by selling memberships in their groups or selling mailing lists of those who sign up, according to some conservative politicians and activists who have labeled the efforts as scams.
The Washington Post first reported on the Dorrs' role in the events.
The pages are just part of the more than 100 state-specific Facebook groups that have been created in the last two weeks to protest the stay-at-home orders, according to an unpublished analysis by First Draft, an organization that researches disinformation. The pages have organized at least 49 different events. Most of the groups are similarly named, and they have attracted more than 900,000 members in total.
The Dorrs' pages, however, follow a particularly uniform naming system, according to information openly available on Facebook. A Dorr brother created or is an administrator for the groups Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine, Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine, New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine and Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine.
Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew Dorr did not reply to requests for comment.
Ben Dorr told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the claims that his efforts are scams are ""fake news"" and that he plans to continue his work.
The network
The Facebook groups started by the Dorrs each promote state-specific websites, which were registered with the same private registrar, and use similar language in their descriptions.
""It's time to OPEN UP PENNSYLVANIA and STOP Gov Wolf's Excessive Quarantine!"" Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine's ""About"" section reads, referring to Gov. Tom Wolf. ""Politicians are on a power trip, controlling our lives, destroying our businesses, passing laws behind the cover of darkness and forcing us to hand over our freedoms and our livelihood!""
Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantines, a private Facebook group with about 97,000 members, is hosting a rally called ""Operation Gridlock"" in Madison next week. At least 300 people have indicated that they will go to the event, which lists Ben Dorr as its creator.

The websites, such as ReOpenPA.com and ReOpenMN.com, were initially shared by the same network of pro-gun and anti-vaccination sites, regardless of region, according to an analysis using the Facebook analytics tool CrowdTangle, which lets people track the spread of content on the platform.
For example, ReOpenPA.com and ReOpenMN.com were initially shared by the Dorr-affiliated Facebook groups Ohio Gun Owners, Pennsylvania Firearms Association, New York Firearms Association, a pro-Trump group called Ohio First and an anti-vaccine group called VaXism.
Data harvesting
The Dorrs' network of pages uses a strategy of data harvesting common in activist circles.
Their groups drive users to petitions on Dorr-registered websites, which collect users' email and home addresses. The groups repeatedly warn users not to use off-site petition platforms like Change.org.
The websites ask users to enter their information to push for change.
""Want to stop the madness? Want to stop Walz? The direct connect tech in the link below was very costly but we're providing because it was SO EFFECTIVE,"" a post on Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine wrote, referring to Gov. Tim Walz. ""Please, if you do nothing else. SEND. THAT. EMAIL.""
The site then collects the user's name and home and email addresses.
Aaron and Ben Dorr — residents of Minnesota and Iowa, respectively — are administrators of New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, which has more than 23,000 members organizing against stay-at-home orders in New York.
Renee DiResta, the research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said the Dorrs' setups ""ensure that they're in control of the audience and not so much a large infrastructure for feedback to the state.""

This sort of Facebook activity is common, DiResta said, and it allows for a small group with money and media manipulation skills to simulate the appearance of a much larger movement. It also allows the group to harvest email addresses for future political campaigns, which can be bought and sold.
NBC News found no evidence that the Dorrs had made money off the data collected through the groups.
But DiResta said the tactics are often used to capitalize on legitimate political activism.
""In this particular case, there's real momentum from grassroots people who are angry,"" she said. ""Recognizing that people are going to be searching for that, it provides an opportunity for someone who wants to piggyback on that outrage for, in this case, it seems like, outreach for future campaigns.""
The Dorrs
The Dorr brothers are known among mainstream conservative activists for inflammatory campaigns that harvest data.
The brothers are the founders or directors of or advisers to a string of nonprofit organizations across 12 states that have raised millions of dollars and made enemies of local Republicans and Second Amendment activists. The best-funded Dorr operations are Minnesota Gun Rights, Ohio Gun Owners and Iowa Gun Owners, according to tax filings. They founded a national organization in 2019, American Firearms Coalition, which attacks the NRA as being too soft on gun rights issues.
A 2019 investigation by Fox affiliate KMSP-TV of Minneapolis-St. Paul found that Minnesota Gun Rights continued to raise money through memberships, boasting hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual donations, although the IRS had revoked the group's tax-exempt status in 2016 for failing to file Form 990s. The IRS reinstated its tax-exempt status in 2019. According to tax documents, the group raised $273,000 in 2018, the most recent year for which it filed.
In February, Minnesota's Senate Republican Caucus launched a website warning voters against the Dorr-backed ""scams.""

""Over the last few years, several scammers have popped up in conservative politics in Minnesota,"" the website reads. ""On their face, it looks like they are doing the Lord's work — advocating for Second Amendment rights, pro-life views, election integrity and even supporting President Trump. But a little investigation reveals they are actually just building their own brand and raising money by cashing in on unsuspecting Minnesotans sympathetic to their message.""
According to the state Republicans, the Dorrs create pro-gun, anti-abortion rights and pro-Trump Facebook groups as part of a fundraising scheme but offer nothing in return.
Another Dorr-operated Facebook page and organization, Minnesota Right to Life, was called out by Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, the state's largest anti-abortion rights organization, which said it made false allegations against conservative legislators and raised money for an unpassable bill that it claimed would immediately end abortion.
""The Dorr brothers are established scam artists,"" according to an article on Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life's website. ""Nothing they say can be believed, and giving them your money will not advance the pro-life cause in any way.""","['pro-gun', 'behind']"

"The spectacular rise of human civilization that took place during the last 10,000 years now appears to be coming to an end with the refusal of our species to significantly curb the carbon emissions and pollutants that might cause human extinction.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/a-professor-of-astrophysics-explains-why-humans-are-on-the-path-to-self-destruction-not-the-first-time-theres-been-a-civilization-in-the-universe/,alternet,environment,left,13.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Editor’s note: The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed a former oil and mining industry lobbyist as secretary of the interior. President Donald Trump’s nomination of David Bernhardt, a government official during the George W. Bush administration, easily survived challenges by environmentally minded senators and others. It came amid rapidly mounting scientific evidence that global warming is an existential threat to huge numbers of species, including Homo sapiens.
In the reposted column below, first published on Truthdig on Aug. 19, 2018, Chris Hedges writes about climate change and interviews a scientist who is among the many warning about what they call the monumental damage that human-made emissions are causing to the atmosphere and the planet. Hedges will return with a new column next Monday.
The spectacular rise of human civilization—its agrarian societies, cities, states, empires and industrial and technological advances ranging from irrigation and the use of metals to nuclear fusion—took place during the last 10,000 years, after the last ice age. Much of North America was buried, before the ice retreated, under sheets eight times the height of the Empire State Building. This tiny span of time on a planet that is 4.5 billion years old is known as the Holocene Age. It now appears to be coming to an end with the refusal of our species to significantly curb the carbon emissions and pollutants that might cause human extinction. The human-induced change to the ecosystem, at least for many thousands of years, will probably make the biosphere inhospitable to most forms of life.
The planet is transitioning under our onslaught to a new era called the Anthropocene. This era is the product of violent conquest, warfare, slavery, genocide and the Industrial Revolution, which began about 200 years ago and saw humans start to burn a hundred million years of sunlight stored in the form of coal and petroleum. The numbers of humans climbed to over 7 billion. Air, water, ice and rock, which are interdependent, changed. Temperatures climbed. The Anthropocene, for humans and most other species, will most likely conclude with extinction or a massive die-off, as well as climate conditions that will preclude most known life forms. We engineered our march toward collective suicide although global warming was first identified in 1896 by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius.
The failure to act to ameliorate global warming exposes the myth of human progress and the illusion that we are rational creatures. We ignore the wisdom of the past and the stark scientific facts before us. We are entranced by electronic hallucinations and burlesque acts, including those emanating from the centers of power, and this ensures our doom. Speak this unpleasant truth and you are condemned by much of society. The mania for hope and magical thinking is as seductive in the Industrial Age as it was in pre-modern societies.
Ate and Nemesis were minor deities who were evoked in ancient Greek drama. Those infected with hubris, the Greeks warned, lost touch with the sacred, believed they could defy fate, or fortuna, and abandoned humility and virtue. They thought of themselves as gods. Their hubris blinded them to human limits and led them to carry out acts of suicidal folly, embodied in the god Ate. This provoked the wrath of the other gods. Divine retribution, in the form of Nemesis, led to tragedy and death and then restored balance and order, once those poisoned with hubris were eradicated. “Too late, too late you see the path of wisdom,” the Chorus in the play “Antigone” tells Creon, ruler of Thebes, whose family has died because of his hubris.
“We’re probably not the first time there’s been a civilization in the universe,” Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester and the author of “Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth,” told me when we met in New York.
“The idea that we’re destroying the planet gives us way too much credit,” he went on. “Certainly, we’re pushing the earth into a new era. If we look at the history of the biosphere, the history of life on earth, in the long run, the earth is just going to pick that up and do what is interesting for it. It will run new evolutionary experiments. We, on the other hand, may not be a part of that experiment.”
Civilizations probably have risen elsewhere in the universe, developed complex societies and then died because of their own technological advances. Every star in the night sky is believed to be circled by planets, some 10 billion trillion of which astronomers such as Frank Drake estimate are hospitable to life.
“If you develop an industrial civilization like ours, the route is going to be the same,” Adam Frank said. “You’re going to have a hard time not triggering climate change.”
Astronomers call the inevitable death of advanced civilizations across the universe “the great filter.” Robin Hanson in the essay “The Great Filter—Are We Almost Past It?” argues that advanced civilizations hit a wall or a barrier that makes continued existence impossible. The more that human societies evolve, according to Hanson, the more they become “energy intensive” and ensure their own obliteration. This is why, many astronomers theorize, we have not encountered other advanced civilizations in the universe. They destroyed themselves.
“For a civilization to destroy itself through nuclear war, it has to have certain emotional characteristics,” Frank said. “You can imagine certain civilizations saying, ‘I’m not building those [nuclear weapons]. Those are crazy.’ But climate change, you can’t get away from. If you build a civilization, you’re using huge amounts of energy. The energy feeds back on the planet, and you’re going to push yourself into a kind of Anthropocene. It’s probably universal.”
Frank said that our inability to project ourselves into a future beyond our own life spans makes it hard for us to grasp the reality and consequences of severe climate change. Scenarios for dramatic climate change often center around the year 2100, when most adults living now will be dead. Although this projection may turn out to be overly optimistic given the accelerating rate of climate change, it allows societies to ignore—because it is outside the life span of most living adults—the slow-motion tsunami that is occurring.
“We think we’re not a part of the biosphere—that we’re above it—that we’re special,” Frank said. “We’re not special.”
“We’re the experiment that the biosphere is running now,” he said. “A hundred million years ago, it was grassland. Grasslands were a new evolutionary innovation. They changed the planet, changed how the planet worked. Then the planet went on and did things with it. Industrial civilization is the latest experiment. We will keep being a part of that experiment or, with the way that we’re pushing the biosphere, it will just move on without us.”
“We have been sending probes to every other planet in the solar system for the last 60 years,” he said. “We have rovers running around on Mars. We’ve learned generically how planets work. From Venus, we’ve learned about the runaway greenhouse effect. On Venus the temperature is 800 degrees. You can melt lead [there]. Mars is a totally dry, barren world now. But it used to have an ocean. It used to be a blue world. We have models that can predict the climate. I can predict the weather on Mars tomorrow via these climate models. People who think the only way we can understand climate is by studying the earth now, that’s completely untrue. These other worlds—Mars, Venus, Titan. Titan is a moon of Saturn that has an amazingly rich atmosphere. They all teach us how to think like a planet. They have taught us generically how planets behave.”
Frank points out that much of the configurations of the ecosystem on which we depend have not always been part of the planet’s biosphere. This includes the Gulf Stream, which carries warm water and warm air up from Florida to Boston and out across the Atlantic.
“Hundreds of millions of people in some of Earth’s most technologically advanced cities rely on the mild climate delivered by the Gulf Stream,” Frank writes in “Light of the Stars.” “But the Gulf Stream is nothing more than a particular circulation pattern formed during a particular climate state the Earth settled into after the last ice age ended. It is not a permanent fixture of the planet.”
“Everything we think about the earth just happens to be this one moment we found it in,” he told me. “We’re pushing it [the planet] and we’re pushing it hard. We don’t have much time to make these transitions. What people have to understand is that climate change is our cosmic adolescence. We should have expected this. The question is not ‘did we change the climate?’ It’s ‘of course we changed the climate. What else did you expect to have happened?’ We’re like a teenager who has been given this power over ourselves. Just like how you give a teenager the keys to the car, there’s this moment where you’re like, ‘Oh my God I hope you make it.’ And that’s what we are.”
“Climate change is not a problem we have to make go away, in a sense that you don’t make adolescence go away,” Frank said. “It is a dangerous transition that you have to navigate. … The question is are we smart enough to deal with the effects of our own power? Climate change is not a pollution problem. It’s not like any environmental problem we’ve faced before. In some sense, it’s not an environmental problem but a planetary transition. We’ve already pushed the earth into it. We’re going to have to evolve a new way of being a civilization, fundamentally.”
“We will either evolve those group behaviors quickly or the earth will take what we’ve given it, in terms of new climate states, and move on and create new species,” he said.
Frank said the mathematical models for the future of the planet have three trajectories. One is a massive die-off of perhaps 70 percent of the human population and then an uneasy stabilization. The second is complete collapse and extinction. The third is a dramatic reconfiguration of human society to protect the biosphere and make it more diverse and productive not for human beings but for the health of the planet. This would include halting our consumption of fossil fuels, converting to a plant-based diet and dismantling the animal agriculture industry as well as greening deserts and restoring rainforests.
There is, Frank warned, a tipping point when the biosphere becomes so degraded no human activity will halt runaway climate change. He cites Venus again.","['spectacular', 'refusal']"
"Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/the-republicans-dumbest-idea-yet/,alternet,environment,left,13.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It’s one thing to oppose the grandiose “Green New Deal” as gratuitously imprecise or for its full-throated attack on all-things-ozone and carbon release in our global community.
It feels like something totally other to oppose narrow regulations that could advance the campaign to swap out incandescent light bulbs for light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, a small, practical step that, multiplied into the millions, would passively remove a healthy chunk of energy-eating pollution over time.
Actually, I was surprised to see a recent editorial about all this in The Washington Post, which argued that “Of all the counterproductive policy campaigns conservatives have waged in recent years, among the most irrational has been their war on the federal government’s efforts to update the light bulb.”
Lots of politicians and critics across the board have attacked the Green New Deal proposed last week by freshman Democrats Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist. McConnell scornfully said he would call for an immediate vote on the resolution even before details could be discussed, just to have it swept away.
I understand a president so disdainful of the whole idea of climate change, but what baffles me is why he wants to make things worse.
So, I understand that our politicians want practical over primacy—unless you are discussing border security—and I even understand, sort of, a president who is just so disdainful of the whole idea of climate change as to not discuss what to do about it. But what baffles me is why there would be support to make things worse.
It’s why I find Trump’s support for re-opening coal mines a bit nutty as policy when there is no real marketplace for coal, and the proven resulting pollution obviously makes what is already bad much worse.
As the Post editorial argued, “Swapping out all the old incandescent bulbs across the country would save an astonishing amount of energy, which would translate into big savings for consumers and less pollution over time. But Republicans stymied the Obama administration’s efforts to pursue this policy, which has no downside, and the Trump administration is now using its power over federal efficiency standards to extend the rollback.”
It was in 2007 that Congress mandated a shift toward the LED light bulb. As manufacturers invested in manufacturing lights that use these updated technologies, the prices dropped, the bulbs improved and consumers saw lower energy bills for doing very little.
By 2020, all bulbs were supposed to be LEDs, including bulbs for candelabras, recessed lighting, heavy-duty applications and others also be subject added in the latter days of the Obama era. The Trump administration moved last week to eliminate those addition, despite the fact that the 2020 standards would have saved consumers billions of dollars per year and 140 billion kilowatt-hours in energy waste—the equivalent to the output of 45 coal-fired power plants—in 2025, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which advocates stiffer efficiency programs. Exempting candelabra and other lights from the 2020 standard could cut roughly in half the number of bulbs that would be required to use better technology, research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests. The Appliance Standards Awareness Project estimates that the Trump rollback will cost consumers an additional $12 billion per year in 2025.
The editorial noted that the Trump administration has signaled that it would attempt to roll back the 2020 standards further in coming months.
The editorial concluded, “There is no excuse for unnecessary energy waste and every reason for the federal government to coordinate a move toward better bulbs. The Trump administration should halt its know-nothing rollback.”
In my environmental balance, we should be seeking out painless, passive ways to make things a bit better. As I am reminded about eating towards better health, we need not go on starvation diets, we just need to pay better attention to everyday habits.
The habit in this administration seems to be doing the opposite.","['blown', 'Socialist', 'overstepping', 'slap', 'down', 'unruly']"
"Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/why-theyre-scared-of-greta-thunberg-right-wingers-cant-deny-this-climate-activists-truth-in-desperation-theyre-resorting-to-malice-bigotry-and-lies/,alternet,environment,left,14.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt of this. The modern-day conservative was revealed, in all his glory, as a weak-minded coward who hides behind unearned privileges, because he is incapable of handling a fair-minded debate, much less real moral accountability.
Thunberg’s trip to the U.S. for the UN Climate Action Summit had, before this week, already been a remarkable success. The 16-year-old’s steely-eyed courage has helped inspire kids across the country — and the world — to join her call to strike from school last week and stand up for more aggressive action to combat the climate crisis.
On Monday, Thunberg finally gave her speech before the UN and, for those who haven’t yet seen it, it was a doozy. She accused world leaders of betrayal and warned that the “eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.”
(As a note: Yes, you can read a transcript of the speech, but it really helps to watch the video, because Thunberg’s passion and clarity is powerful and sobering.)
Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say. Even though Thunberg is capable of doing things many on the right refuse to do — such as read and understand scientific evidence — the argument is that Thunberg and her fellow youth activists cannot think for themselves.
On Fox News, Michael Knowles of the right-wing outlet Daily Wire, in full grumpy-old-man mode, described Thunberg on Monday as “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” a statement so ugly that even the network was forced to denounce it.
It’s a bit unclear, however, what Fox News was apologizing for, since Knowles’ argument is just a blunter version of what all their pundits have said about Thunberg.
Laura Ingraham compared Thunberg and other climate activists to “Children of the Corn,” a Stephen King story about children brainwashed into a murderous cult.
Industry-backed climate change denier Marc Morano argued that Thunberg is “causing and instilling fear in millions of kids around the world,” as if the anxiety were anything but a rational reaction to real world events. He also compared climate science to “medieval witchcraft.”
The New York Times, in a stunning demonstration of bad judgment, let climate-change denier Christopher Caldwell write an op-ed complaining that “a 16-year-old is not a legally responsible adult,” and trying to discredit her by saying “she is diminutive and fresh-faced, comes off as younger than her years.”
Of course, Donald Trump had to get in on the action, talking down to Thunberg with a sarcastic tweet that was the equivalent of telling her she’d be pretty if she smiled more.
All of these attacks say almost about Thunberg or the other kids — some as young as elementary age — who have correctly called out adults for failing to do more to slow climate change.
These attacks speak to conservatives’ dependence on irrational social hierarchies that determine who is “right” or “wrong” not by virtue of evidence or reason, but based on who has more social power due to age, gender or social class. Thunberg and her youth activist cohort strike fear into the hearts of right-wingers precisely because they have uncovered the lie that age automatically grants wisdom.
Just by doing her thing, Thunberg has exposed the way climate-change deniers hide behind their unearned privileges to assert themselves as authorities on a topic where they are literally denying basic scientific facts. To borrow Morano’s metaphor, climate-change deniers are reminiscent of witch hunters in the past, who hid behind the Bible and the authority of their gender in order to persecute innocent women.
When liberals understandably lashed out at these insipid, ad hominem attacks against Thunberg, some conservatives shifted their tactics towards false claims that Thunberg and her allies are hiding behind her age, using youth as a shield from criticism. Professional troll Charlie Kirk added a charge of hypocrisy, since those same liberals who were supposedly claiming that you “can’t” criticize a 16-year-old also criticized a group of high school kids in January who were videotaped in MAGA hats acting like jackasses after an anti-choice protest in Washington.
The same people who say we can’t criticize 16-year old ANTIFA climate activist Greta Von Thunburg …Spent months shamelessly attacking the Covington Catholic High School kids—just because they supported our president 🤔 — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 23, 2019
This would be an argument, I guess, if anyone was actually assert a blanket “you can’t criticize kids” argument. In reality, criticizing the Covington students and supporting Greta Thunberg share a common assumption, which is the exact opposite of Kirk’s claim. In both cases, teenagers are fledgling moral actors, and, as such, deserve to be taken seriously when they make political statements.
In fact, there’s an entirely consistent argument here. The Covington were old enough to be held responsible for their actions. Greta Thunberg is old enough to be considered a rational actor whose arguments hold weight.
To put it another way, no one is saying you can’t criticize a teenager. But the “criticisms” of Thunberg are nothing more than ad hominem attacks and vitriol, thrown out there in a desperate attempt to hide the fact that the right has no substantive argument on the climate crisis.
We saw the right pulling the same trick with the Parkland kids, pretending that liberals were “using” the students for nefarious political purposes. In fact, young people are standing up on issues like climate and guns for the simple reason that they are the people most under threat.
Conservatives are, as usual, the ones being inconsistent here. When kids express right-wing views, they are assumed by conservatives to be responsible actors thinking for themselves. able to think for themselves. When they support progressive or liberal causes, they are accused of being puppets. The fairest response is to see both conservative and liberal kids as responsible for their own opinions, and to give credit or condemnation appropriately.
Ultimately, it’s good to see grown men so afraid of a teenage girl speaking truth to power. It’s a reminder that conservatives know, on some level, that their authority is a house of cards, and that they don’t deserve all the deference they get simply by being white, male or old. Thunberg represents the possibility of looking past rules that treat young women as inherently inferior and not worthy of respect. She demands that we take people’s arguments and beliefs seriously, instead of dismissing them based on perceptions rooted in identity. Conservatives understand one thing clearly —they will not do well in a world where what you say and do matters more than who you are.","['right-wingers', 'ugliest', 'discredits']"
"The anti-vaccine crowd frequently falls back on the claim that vaccines cause autism, despite more than two dozen studies clearly showing that vaccination does not increase the incidence of autism. Nor did it make a whit of biological sense that vaccines would.",https://www.alternet.org/2018/07/celebrity-pseudoscience-here-are-nine-household-names-whove-pushed-bad-science-public/,alternet,vaccines,left,14.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"In our post-truth era, scientific illiteracy has morphed into science denialism. Today, people simply declare their own truths. As a consequence, science is losing its platform as a source of truth. Meanwhile, a pervasive celebrity culture — in which celebrities are considered trusted “experts” solely because of their fame — has poisoned the idea of what constitutes expertise.
Nowhere is the merger of these two trends more evident than in our embrace of “celebrity science,” which, because it often involves issues of health, might not only be misleading but harmful. Some celebrities actually do have science backgrounds; Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience, springs to mind. Unfortunately, many celebrities have waded into debates within fields in which they have neither expertise nor training, perhaps unintentionally injecting doubt into scientific certainty and often even harming public health efforts. Here are a few of the worst celebrity offenders
This article first appeared in Salon.
Anti-vaccine crusaders Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, Kristin Cavallari and Rob Schneider: The anti-vaccine crowd frequently falls back on the claim that vaccines cause autism, despite more than two dozen studies clearly showing that vaccination does not increase the incidence of autism. Nor did it make a whit of biological sense that vaccines would.
Gwyneth Paltrow: Paltrow is probably best known for her promotion of vaginal steaming, jade eggs and cleansing enemas. Paltrow believes that vaginal steaming with mugwort balances female hormones and cleanses the uterus. Apart from the fact that mugwort isn’t a hormone and vaginal steam will never reach the uterus, vaginal steaming can cause burns and bacterial infections. The jade eggs placed in the vagina to enhance muscle tone put users at risk of toxic shock syndrome, and the “toxin-removing” colonic enemas Paltrow prescribes, which have no proven benefit in otherwise healthy people, can cause dehydration, infections, vomiting and, worst of all, bowel perforations.
Suzanne Somers: Somers has become a one-woman industry, promoting megavitamins, supplements and minerals, as well as skin-care, weight-loss, and detoxification products on her website. When Somers says use her hormone replacement therapy because it’s “all natural” and isn’t going to cause the sort of problems that regular hormone replacement therapy cause, that’s bad advice. If a product causes a physiological response, it doesn’t matter whether it’s synthesized in a laboratory or derived from nature — it still has the same effect, which means that it can also have the same negative consequences. Also, antioxidants like Vitamin A, Vitamin E and the mineral selenium given in quantities vastly in excess of the recommended daily allowance actually increase the risk of cancer and heart disease.
Katie Couric: On Dec. 4, 2013, Katie Couric aired an episode that raised serious questions about the HPV vaccine. The show featured two mothers whose children had developed either a fatal heart arrhythmia or chronic fatigue syndrome following the vaccine. Couric’s mistake in this episode was the omission of more than a dozen studies performed on more than a million people showing that the vaccine doesn’t cause the problems claimed on her show. She never helped her viewers think through the difference between causal and coincidental associations. Katie Couric’s program only showed that the HPV vaccine doesn’t prevent fatal heart arrhythmias or chronic fatigue syndrome. It only prevents HPV infections.
Angry that she had chosen to scare parents away from a life-saving vaccine, the medical and scientific community rained down on Katie Couric, who later offered a weak, ineffective apology.
Steve Jobs: In 2011, Steve Jobs died from pancreatic cancer. However, Jobs didn’t have the type of cancer for which medicine had little to offer (adenocarcinoma); rather, he had a neuroendocrine tumor — a cancer that has a 95 percent chance of survival with early surgery. Unfortunately, instead of getting the surgery that might have saved his life, Jobs chose acupuncture, bowel cleansings and fruit juices. When he finally had surgery, it was too late. While one can’t blame him for his death, Jobs undoubtedly put himself at unnecessary risk by choosing an alternative course.
Donald J. Trump: Trump’s war against science is also a war against children. When a figurehead like Trump repeats the myth that vaccines cause autism, as he did during the presidential debates, many parents may choose not to vaccinate, putting children at unnecessary risk. When Trump denies climate change, which he stated unequivocally was a hoax, viruses like chikungunya and Dengue travel farther north, now entering states like Texas and Louisiana, causing more American children to suffer. Or when, by picking Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos, he says that creationism is as valid as evolution, children fail to learn important scientific facts in an age where scientific competitiveness with other countries is critical.
The Trump administration’s denial of climate change is reminiscent of the Church’s condemnation of Galileo for daring to say that the Earth wasn’t the center of the firmament, as stated in the Bible. When Galileo was taken away in chains he took a moment to look back at his accusers and say, regarding the Earth, “It still moves.” His point: You can lock me away, but that won’t change the facts. And the Trump administration can deny climate change, back out of the Paris Accords, and insist that the EPA remove the phrase “climate change” from its website. But that won’t change the facts. Human activity is changing our climate. “The good thing about science,” wrote Neil deGrasse Tyson, “is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.”
Although non-celebrity science might not have the glitz or pizzazz of celebrity science, it’s still your better bet. It’s OK to trust websites generated from university centers, hospitals and professional societies even though those who are doing the talking are probably less attractive and less interesting than the celebrities. One other thing: Avoid trusting sites that are selling something or that make claims that sound too good to be true

In a New York Times interview published Thursday King had wondered when white nationalism and white supremacism had become offensive.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” Rep. King had asked the Times. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
After massive outrage including bipartisan denouncements, King backtracked, issuing a statement that ignores his own long history of racist and bigoted remarks.
King, who is perhaps best-known for accusing undocumented immigrants of having “calves the size of cantaloupes” from “running drugs across the Mexican border,” claimed late Thursday he does not support white nationalism or white supremacy.
“I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define,” he said in a statement.
He did not, however, retract his remarks nor did he claim he had been misquoted or taken out of context. King also did not retract any of the many racist and bigoted remarks he has made in the past.
Ironically, experts have said President Trump does not have the legal authority to build the wall by declaring a national emergency and taking money from other funds to do so. It could therefore not be a “monument to the rule of law.”","['under', 'fire', 'white', 'nationalism', 'supremacism', 'defending']"

WASHINGTON — A federal visa program allowing international students to work at firms in the United States after graduation appears to have been exploited by fake companies providing false employment verifications, according to an NBC News/NBC Bay Area investigation.
The F-1 visa program includes a component that allows students to stay in the U.S. to get practical work experience after obtaining their professional degrees. Many students, schools and employers use the program legitimately, as intended. But a recent federal prosecution revealed the potential for fraud, with a defendant admitting in court papers she had provided false employment records for nearly 2,700 students.
'It helps tremendously'
To understand the F-1 student visa program, it's helpful to see how it's supposed to work.
Fawaz Alshatti is a Kuwaiti national who came to the U.S. to study and has stayed to work as an architectural engineer.
""I decided to get some more experience and work in the U.S.,"" he said from his job at TK Architects in Kansas City, Missouri.
The company specializes in entertainment projects. Alshatti helps design systems for movie theaters, bowling alleys, restaurants and bars.
""It provided me with a great opportunity to work with people in this country and to gain such experience in a different work environment,"" he said.
He legally entered the U.S. as an international student after obtaining an F-1 student visa. Once he graduated, he applied to the visa's ""Optional Practical Training"" program, or OPT. It allows international students to work in the U.S. after getting their degrees for a period of 12-36 months.
His employer said the program is invaluable.
""Having international staff is a big benefit for us — both in terms of language (and) culture,"" Jack Muffoletto, who runs TK Architects, said. ""It helps tremendously.""
Alshatti got his undergraduate and two master's degrees from the University of Kansas, where he applied for the OPT program in June 2018, 60 days before the end of his study. Government regulations allow a narrow window for applying: from 90 days before the end of a student's study program to 60 days after.
Alshatti said the university was helpful throughout the application process. It has an office that provides support services to international students, advising them about immigration and study and work visa requirements.
He also said the university's advisers were strict about checking that students followed all the rules and requirements. ""They will contact maybe your employer, behind your back basically, that you don't actually know,"" he said. ""And then they'll make sure that you're actually doing what you're supposed to do. And you're actually doing something within your field, not even something outside your field.""
The university is a big participant in the F-1 OPT program. As of last month, of the 2,040 KU students who have active F-1 visa records, 330 have requested or obtained OPT authorizations.
The University of Kansas is a big participant in the F-1 OPT program, with 330 students having requested or obtained OPT authorizations. The university says the program is extremely important and beneficial to both employers and students. While a few students were found to have submitted spurious employment records, the vast majority used the program as intended. Nightly News
""It's extraordinarily important,"" Charles Bankart, KU's associate vice provost for international affairs, said. ""One of the things that an institution — especially public institutions as a whole — really pride themselves on and focus upon is career readiness. And we do a lot on campus over the course of a student's time here to expose them to experiential learning opportunities.""
Bankart said employers were struck by how OPT students bring a fresh cultural perspective into the workplace.
""It's one thing to train as an engineer or as an architect or a sociologist,"" he said. ""It's another thing to have a deeply informed cultural context there.""
Signs of trouble
While the OPT program draws rave reviews from some employers and universities, a joint investigation by NBC News and KNTV — NBC's Bay Area station — found that some of the companies on the government's list of top OPT employers appear to be illegitimate.
The list of top employers, prepared and released by the Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), includes familiar names: Amazon, Google, Microsoft.

But then, there's one that's not so well-known: ""Findream, LLC.""
In fact, Findream's founder, a woman named Weiyun ""Kelly"" Huang, was charged with criminal fraud in federal court in Illinois.
According to court documents, Findream's alleged purpose was ""false verifications of employment"" for Chinese F-1 visa holders seeking work employment ""via the OPT program.""
An affidavit prepared by an FBI special agent alleges that a website associated with Findream described the OPT opportunity to prospective students as ""pretend' work."" If a document submission is ""well-prepared,"" the website said, ""it will look real"" and the U.S. government ""will think your status is legal.""
The FBI visited the company's listed office in Chicago and found it was bogus. It was ""a company on paper only,"" according to court documents.
At a change of plea hearing Dec. 20, Huang, a Chinese national, changed her plea to guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud.
Court records show Huang also agreed to plead guilty on behalf of the two entities that were co-defendants in the case, Findream, LLC and Sinocontech, LLC.
Huang admitted she and/or her co-conspirators submitted government forms falsely stating students were employed by the two entities.
The plea agreement states that between 2013 and 2019, ""defendant falsely and fraudulently represented"" that almost 2,700 F-1 visa holders in the U.S. were employed by Findream or Sinocontech, and that Huang and the two firms got about $1.5 million from their customers, creating ""a profit or gain of at least approximately $800,000.""
Huang faces a maximum five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. She is scheduled to be sentenced March 20.
Along with many other schools, the University of Kansas was fooled by Findream. After learning of the federal indictment, the university found seven students who'd reported Findream LLC as an employer.
Charles Bankart, the KU official, said everything seemed legitimate — and that it was ""impossible"" for schools to police this.
""You look at the documentation (and) everything is there,"" he said. ""All the boxes are checked. And the students acted in good faith. This was a registered organization…That's not the student's fault. That's not the institution's fault. That's not the government's fault. That's a crook.""
Part of a pattern?
Over several months, NBC News and KNTV searched for some of the other companies on the list. Several were hard to find. For example: Tellon Trading had incorporation records in the state of Georgia. But NBC News visited five addresses listed in those documents and found no sign of Tellon.
In California, investigative reporter Stephen Stock of KNTV picked up the trail — and couldn't find the company either.
The Student and Exchange Visitor Program recently revamped the methodology it uses to generate data on international students. It provided NBC News a preliminary look at the new data. In 2017, Tellon employed 877 OPT participants, compared to 647 in 2018. In 2017, Findream employed 500 OPT participants, compared to 312 in 2018.
NBC News correspondent Gabe Gutierrez visiting one of several addresses linked to Findream, LLC in the Atlanta, Georgia area. Nightly News
According to government officials, the majority of OPT participants were only employed at Findream for a very short time, listing Findream as an employer for up to 14 days. It's likely, these officials say, that these students never worked for Findream, but may have initially listed it as their employer while they tried to obtain legitimate OPT employment.
Still, supporters of the OPT program argue that the number of students employed by questionable companies is a very small percentage of the total number of students participating in the program.
According to SEVP data, 204,633 students participated in OPT in 2017, and 200,162 did so in 2018.
""There's always people who want to exploit legal immigration,"" Rachel Canty, SEVP director, said.
SEVP, which is part of DHS' National Security Investigations Division, administratively oversees the international student visa programs, including the F-1 visa program and its OPT component. It uses the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to track and monitor students, schools and employers.
Canty insisted the agency's systems of checks were working and said there were criminal investigations and convictions.
""We do a lot of back-end data analytics once we have the list of companies where people are working. We work with our partners to identify those [where] there may be issues,"" Canty said.
""We have criminal investigations and convictions all the time,"" she added.
In November, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that an undercover probe had resulted in the arrest of about 250 foreign students. Many had been studying in the U.S. on F-1 visas through a program called ""Curricular Practical Training,"" or CPT. The students had enrolled at the University of Farmington near Detroit, despite knowing it was a fake school without classes or teachers. The students were unaware federal investigators had created the school as part of a sting operation.
Undercover video released by ICE in December shows several students agreeing to pay the University of Farmington to enroll after being told directly that ""it’s not legal.""
Canty also cited DHS' successful detection of three fictitious schools the U.S. Government Accountability Office had created and submitted fraudulent certification petitions for as part of a recent audit of SEVP's management of fraud risks.
But that same audit found other potential fraud risks, including a backlog of reviews of participating schools and no training about potential fraud risks for school officials the program relies on to report potential fraud. In September, ICE issued new guidance.
Officials at SEVP say they welcome scrutiny of potentially illegitimate companies, seeing it as a deterrent.
They note that the number of F-1 visa students participating in the OPT program through both Findream, LLC and Tellon Trading has decreased.
According to its new data: Tellon employed 877 OPT participants in 2017, and 647 OPT participants in 2018. Findream employed 500 OPT participants in 2017, and 312 OPT participants in 2018.
The OPT program is drawing scrutiny on multiple fronts. More than 100 colleges have signed on to an amicus brief opposing a lawsuit that's trying to end the program. The lawsuit was brought by the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers. The labor union claims that the DHS overstepped its authority by creating OPT, which it argues essentially establishes a foreign guest-worker program without congressional approval. The colleges say ending OPT would hurt their ability to attract international students.
But even supporters of international student visa programs say more needs to be done to address their vulnerabilities, not only fraud risks but also potential national security risks.
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warns that student visa programs pose potential national security risks, and that nations engaging in active foreign espionage to try and steal U.S. intellectual property, such as China, may be exploiting their vulnerabilities.

"The administration has stonewalled Congress during the impeachment proceedings and other investigations, but the American public overwhelmingly wants the Trump administration to comply with lawmakers.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/betsy-devos-approval-rating-is-28-percent-as-voters-back-investigations-into-student-debt-scandal-poll/,alternet,student-debt,left,15.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"A majority of voters support congressional investigations into Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ handling of student debt programs, according to the results of a new poll, which exposes how deeply unpopular the Trump Cabinet member is across the country.
DeVos has an approval rating of just 28%, according to a survey conducted by Global Strategy Group on behalf of government watchdog Allied Progress, who provided the results to Salon. DeVos received the lowest approval rating of any Trump administration official tested. The next most unpopular official was acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at 33%.
The survey, which sampled 1,008 registered voters, also found overwhelming support for congressional investigations into whether DeVos abused taxpayer funds or used her position to benefit herself or her family.
“If Secretary DeVos was hoping Americans are too distracted by President Trump’s scandals to notice or care are about her efforts to sell out student borrowers, she’s in for a shock,” Derek Martin, the director of Allied Progress, said. “We found the public is especially skeptical of Secretary DeVos — for good reason. What motivated DeVos’ decisions to disregard the law in order to deny debt relief to defrauded borrowers and disabled veterans? Americans want to know, and it’s Congress’ duty to find out.”
The poll finds that 58% of voters support an investigation into DeVos withholding automatic student debt relief from severely disabled veterans despite calls to do so from nearly every attorney general in the country. Data released by the department showed that although it had identified more than 42,000 veterans who were eligible for debt forgiveness, fewer than 9,000 submitted the new applications it required. A bipartisan group of 51 attorneys general said the requirements “may prove insurmountable obstacles to relief for many eligible veterans due to the severe nature of their disabilities.”
DeVos is also facing scrutiny failing to process more than 200,000 student loan forgiveness applications from potentially defrauded borrowers. The poll shows that 56% of voters, including 60% of independents, support an investigation after documents obtained by NPR showed that DeVos overruled career staff at the department and argued that students defrauded by for-profit colleges only deserved partial debt relief.
Her decision was blocked by a judge, who threatened to throw her in jail for contempt of court after the department nonetheless tried to collect debt payments from defrauded students. DeVos recently introduced a new plan that creates an income-based scale that determines how much debt relief defrauded students are eligible for — once again only primarily providing partial loan forgiveness.
Voters also back investigations into DeVos awarding a lucrative loan collection contract to Performant Financial, a company which she invested in before becoming secretary, in spite of a “marginal” bid, The Washington Post reported. Though the department ultimately canceled the contract after rival companies raised issues over the appearance of a conflict of interest, the poll finds that 56% of voters support an investigation into her handling of the contracts.
The poll also shows that the American public wants Congress to step up its oversight of the Trump administration. If finds that 52% want Congress to conduct more oversight of senior Trump administration officials, compared to just 19% who think Congress should conduct less oversight of the administration. The numbers also show that 51% of the country believes the Trump administration is more corrupt than previous administrations.
Even many voters who opposed Trump’s impeachment support increased oversight of his administration. Of the 42% of voters who opposed impeachment, 46% support increased oversight.
The administration has stonewalled Congress during the impeachment proceedings and other investigations, but the American public overwhelmingly wants the Trump administration to comply with lawmakers.
More than 80% of voters say Trump administration officials should appear before congressional committees, and 70% say they should comply with congregational subpoenas. The poll shows that 65% of voters believe corruption is a serious problem in the administration, and 54% of voters believe officials are avoiding Congress because they have “something to hide.”
That is exactly what House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., suggested when she threatened to subpoena DeVos after she “stonewalled” the committee in setting up a date for her to testify about her handling of the debt programs.
“Unfortunately, it now appears that rather than agreeing to testify before Congress — which is your obligation as a public servant of the American taxpayers — you made plans to appear at multiple political events for President Trump’s re-election campaign,” Maloney said in a letter to DeVos earlier this week. “Ignoring — or defying — requests for congressional oversight in order to spend your time campaigning for President Trump is an abuse of your position as secretary of education . . . If you will not agree to testify voluntarily, the committee will have no choice but to consider issuing a subpoena to compel your appearance.”","['overwhelmingly', 'stonewalled']"

"When the Muslim ban was first enacted, it triggered chaos at airports and prompted widespread protest and legal challenges, and it continues to impose devastating costs on families and people who wish to come to the U.S.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/conservative-magazine-denounces-trumps-cruel-expansion-of-his-muslim-ban/,alternet,immigration,left,15.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"While President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial had been wrapping up, he expanded one of his most controversial and inflammatory policies with little fanfare and minimal opposition: the travel ban on people from multiple Muslim-majority countries.
The previous version, which has been approved by the Supreme Court after it was rewritten multiple times, strictly barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela. In court and in public, the administration defended the extreme and disruptive measure being based on national security considerations, though it was clearly an instantiation of Trump’s bigoted campaign promise to end all Muslim immigration to the United States. When the ban was first enacted, it triggered chaos at airports and prompted widespread protest and legal challenges, and it continues to impose devastating costs on families and people who wish to come to the U.S.
Now, though, the ban has been expanded to include Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania, and the public reaction has been subdued. Perhaps this is because, given the Supreme Court gave it’s blessing on the previous version of the ban, opponents fear there is little that can be done to restrain Trump now.
But Daniel Larison, writing a piece for the magazine The American Conservative that denounced the policy as “cruel,” argued that the new expansion is transparently unnecessary.
“There is no legitimate security reason for such sweeping restrictions, and the new list seems like a grab-bag of countries that have large Muslim populations with nothing else linking them together,” he wrote. “Like previous versions of the ban, this is an attempt to use phony national security justifications to make changes to immigration policy that Congress wouldn’t approve.”
And Larison pointed out that there’s not even any evidence that Nigeria, or the other countries now targeted, export terrorism to the United States, which is ostensibly the reason for the ban. At the same time, a country that actually has seen its nationals commit terrorist acts in the U.S. — Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the Trump administration — is conspicuously missing from the list. Clearly, the point is just to limit immigration, even though Nigerian immigrants “have had great success in the U.S.,” Larison wrote.
New York Times Columnist Jamelle Bouie said that “the only explanation for adding Nigeria to the travel ban is as an act of racial control.”
“The entire expanded travel ban needs to be ended as soon as possible,” said Larison. “Rescinding this ban should be one of the first things that the next administration does.”","['chaos', 'devastating', 'triggered']"

"But in an age when anti-vaccine conspiracy theories travel far and wide online and many parents are afraid of taking their pediatrician’s advice, Kentucky’s loose vaccination laws directly incentivize parents to follow Bevin’s lead.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/this-gop-governor-just-said-he-deliberately-infected-his-children-with-chickenpox-while-defending-vaccine-exemptions/,alternet,vaccines,left,15.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY) told WKCT radio on Tuesday that he opposes mandating vaccines to send children to school — and as evidence that there are alternatives, explained that he had deliberately infected his children with chickenpox.
Bevin, who has nine kids including four who were adopted, explained that after contracting the virus, they were “miserable for a few days” but “they all turned out fine.” He added that parents should vaccinate if they are afraid of the disease, but that we shouldn’t make it compulsory.
Bevin’s downplaying of the necessity of vaccines is reckless — but deliberately infecting his children is much more so. Though most children who suffer from chickenpox recover with no problems and never get the disease again, in severe cases it can cause pneumonia, bleeding, sepsis, encephalitis, and in some cases can be fatal. Bevin has also put his children at risk of developing shingles in later life, a painful rash caused by the dormant Varicella virus reactivating.
Before the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995, there were around 4 million cases of the disease every year, with up to 18,000 hospitalizations and 100-150 deaths. Despite the risks, “chickenpox parties” like Bevin’s used to be fairly common, with parents who believed the disease was inevitable deliberately infecting their children young so they wouldn’t get the disease as adults when it is much more dangerous.
Even before the vaccine was developed, deliberately infecting children was a dice roll with their health. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes clear that it “strongly recommends against hosting or participating in these events. Chickenpox can be serious and can lead to severe complications and death, even in healthy children. There is no way to tell in advance how severe your child’s symptoms will be. So it is not worth taking the chance of exposing your child to someone with the disease. The best way to protect infants and children against chickenpox is to get them vaccinated.”
But in an age when anti-vaccine conspiracy theories travel far and wide online and many parents are afraid of taking their pediatrician’s advice, Kentucky’s loose vaccination laws directly incentivize parents to follow Bevin’s lead. In Kentucky, parents who want to send unvaccinated kids to school can obtain a religious exemption, or provide proof that their childen have already had the disease — which all but invites parents to use chickenpox parties as an alternative if they erroneously oppose vaccines.
Bevin has shown his lack of concern for children’s safety on previous occasions. In January, during a deadly cold snap that plunged temperatures in Kentucky to below zero, Bevin scorned the decision of public schools to shut down, saying “we’re getting soft” and that we shouldn’t be teaching children that “you can curl up in the fetal position somewhere in a warm place and just wait until it stops being hard.” Evidently, Bevin never stopped to think that many children walk to school, and would be risking frostbite and hypothermia.
Kentucky is one of three states that holds gubernatorial elections in 2019, along with Louisiana and Mississippi. Bevin, who is highly unpopular despite the state’s deeply conservative lean, faces a tough re-election battle, with GOP state Rep. Robert Goforth challenging him in the primary and Democratic state Attorney General Andy Beshear, state House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins, and former state auditor Adam Edelen vying to take him on in the general election.","['conspiracy', 'theories']"
"It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with melodramatic liars and grifters.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/how-the-religious-rights-war-against-abortion-is-built-on-lies-grifting-and-bullying/,alternet,abortion,left,16.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Tuesday, both the pro- and anti-choice world were rocked by a revelation that undermines literal decades of religious right nonsense. Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous “conversion” to anti-abortion activism was a con job.
McCorvey told filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, “AKA Jane Roe,” “I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
For pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey’s “conversion” as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don’t want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless “abortion industry.”
McCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was “saved” by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can’t be trusted with autonomy, and need “godly” men to guide them.
(Benham, a supposedly wise and “pro-life” guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among the protesters, clinic staff and the pregnant people seeking care.)
Having spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey’s “conversion” was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped, even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn’t try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn’t seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.
So yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers — nearly half a million dollars over the years — sounds about right.
But the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn’t about McCorvey’s character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire raison d’être is telling lies — often over-the-top, melodramatic lies — in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the “right” of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.
The anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become one big, long con.
The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.
For instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)
To bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice “testimony” is all to often as McCorvey described it: “[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
But this “born alive” mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump’s weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.
The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.
A series of “undercover” videos purporting to “prove” that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling “baby parts” out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would turn out to be bullshit, but too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.
Sure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn’t sell baby parts.” They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research — research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.
This myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest buffer zone around clinics by claiming they were merely “sidewalk counselors” trying to “help” women.
An investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They’re a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.
“If women want careers and education and everything and they don’t want children,” one protester complained to Filipovic, “what are they doing having sex?”
Another complained that “there were no problems” back when women “had to be obedient to their husbands.”
Instead of contraception, a protester argued, “the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”
The court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters merely wished to “counsel” women.
Anti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they’re righteous warriors going up against a sleazy “abortion industry” and trying to “save” women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.
In truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them of their rights and subjugate them both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stands with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny and lurid fantasy.
The press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie will help open up some eyes.
But it’s also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don’t want or can’t bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It’s a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.","['anti-choice', 'melodramatic', 'liars']"

One of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/here-are-5-of-trumps-lies-from-his-oval-office-speech-about-his-ridiculous-border-wall-demands/,alternet,immigration,left,16.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Speaking to the country for the first time from the Oval Office Tuesday night, President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for a border wall in a brief speech amid his self-induced government shutdown
Democrats remain completely opposed to the president’s proposal for a wall and arranged to respond to Trump’s remarks shortly after he made them. Ahead of the speech, there was widespread debate about the TV network’s decision to broadcast the speech at all, given Trump’s propensity to lie and mislead about this subject in particular.
Here are five of the lies or misleading statements he made in the address:
1. Trump claimed there is a “security” crisis on the border.
While there has been an increase in children and families crossing the border seeking asylum in recent months, the rate of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is actually much lower than it has been in recent history, as Vox’s Dara Lind explained. The Trump administration’s claims that there is some sort of terrorism risk from the border have been debunked. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.
2. Trump said illegal immigration drives down wages.
One of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. While some economists argue this to be the case for some lower-income workers, many others disagree. But even if it’s true, the impact of immigrants on wages is marginal, and it could be completely wiped out by pro-labor policies that Trump and other Republicans oppose, like raising the minimum wage and protecting unions.
3. Trump lied and said that the Democrats requested a “steel barrier.”
Democrats have not requested a steel barrier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants to spend exactly $0 on the wall — no matter what it’s made out of.
4. Trump said the border wall will pay for itself.
Trump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. There’s no reason to believe this is the case — especially when it’s considered that the government will not only have to pay for the construction of the wall, but for any land seized to build the wall through eminent domain.
5. Trump said the new version of NAFTA will also pay for the wall.
The new version of NAFTA, which Trump calls USMCA, has some minor modifications from the original version. However, there’s no plausible argument that it will somehow pay for the wall. And even if it did, it hasn’t even been passed by Congress yet.",['illegal']
"Trying to bar women from abortion is bad enough in regular times, but it seemed even more sadistic during a pandemic and an economic crash, when financial and health concerns weigh more heavily than ever on women deciding whether or not continue pregnancies.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/the-pandemic-has-triggered-an-abortion-crisis/,alternet,abortion,left,16.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As soon as stay-at-home orders came down across the country, a number of Republican-controlled states tried to argue that abortion was a “non-essential” service and that women who want abortions could just wait until the pandemic was over. That’s a blatantly false and cruel argument. Trying to bar women from abortion is bad enough in regular times, but it seemed even more sadistic during a pandemic and an economic crash, when financial and health concerns weigh more heavily than ever on women deciding whether or not continue pregnancies.
As the opportunistic abortion bans are fought over in the courts, we now have hard numbers showing how much the need for abortion — and for financial support for abortion services — has risen during the coronavirus pandemic.
“There are absolutely increases in calls for help, and that’s compounded by the complexity and difficulty in getting to care,” Yamani Hernandez, executive director for the National Network of Abortion Funds, told Salon.
Abortion funds operate by giving financial and other forms of assistance, such as housing and transportation, to women seeking abortions. Some of these groups are seeing sharp increases in women seeking help. Tampa Bay Abortion Fund saw a 30% increase in callers in April. Chicago Abortion Fund saw a 35% increase in callers in March and April. Funds in Ohio and Texas have doubled their spending limits, and in Texas, at least, are still exceeding them.
Meg Sasse Stern, who directs the abortion fund for the Kentucky Health Justice Network, told Salon that her group has seen an uptick of calls but believes it’s going to increase dramatically over the summer.
She suggested the increase “was delayed because of initial shock and stress,” saying that some women put off having an abortion at the beginning of the lockdown period. Now that lockdowns have dragged on for seven or eight weeks in most places, getting what is obviously a time-sensitive procedure like abortion is now much harder and, for some women, more expensive as well.
The delays women are experiencing, Sasse Stern explained, are understandable. Low-income Kentucky women, who often live in rural areas, already face serious financial and domestic obstacles to getting abortion, and the pandemic has made the situation far worse.
“If someone does not have access to a reliable vehicle or a supportive companion, their ability to travel across the state becomes a lot more complex,” she explained.
“In the past, we would be able to offer up a ride with one of our volunteers, and we cannot do that now,” she continued, noting that the fund is not comfortable with asking volunteers to risk contracting the coronavirus by giving rides.
Sasse Stern also explained that “child care has become a more complicated barrier,” as stay-at-home orders make it far more difficult for women to find someone who can babysit their children for the hours — or days — it may take for them to travel somewhere and get an abortion.
Subsequently, many women may be experiencing delays that push them into the second trimester, where abortion becomes both more expensive and a more intensive procedure.
Amanda Kifferly, vice president of abortion access for The Women’s Centers — which operate in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Georgia — explained that she’s seeing some of the ways that the coronavirus is making it harder for women to get an abortion, which was already difficult because of all the needless bureaucratic obstacles put in place by conservative legislators.
One patient, she explained, had insurance coverage for abortion, but getting it approved required a referral. Even that, which involved a visit to a second office, is a step that’s become much more fraught in the era of coronavirus, especially when health care centers who may have treated infected people seem especially risky.
Kifferly said she hoped that the obstacles to getting any kind of medical care under these conditions, much less a time-sensitive procedure like abortion, would help highlight the need for more access to telemedicine.
Early in pregnancy, women can abort safely with telemedicine by consulting a doctor on video chat or the phone, and having abortion pills prescribed for mail delivery. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that “telemedicine is safe, effective, highly acceptable to patients, and facilitates access to care for women in rural areas.”
But now even women who live in cities and are close to an abortion clinic might want the telemedicine option so they don’t have to manage pandemic-created obstacles or visit a clinic where they fear exposure to the coronavirus.
“We had had our eyes set” on expanding access to telemedicine, Kifferly said. “It’s in line with the way that we feel about abortion,” which is that it should be accessible to all without needless delays or restrictions.
The pandemic has made it easier, she said, “to not only bridge the conversation with politicians, but also with media and with patients,” by clarifying why it’s so important for people to have access to medical care without leaving home whenever that’s a practical option.
The anti-choice movement has long depicted women who need abortions as careless or lazy, as a way to justify restrictions on access. But during this pandemic, more Americans are seeing how a medical emergency can upend your life, and perhaps understanding that it’s not always so easy to juggle transportation, child care, and employment. Maybe this period of universal turmoil will increase empathy for women who need abortions — not just during the pandemic but into the future — and increased awareness of why it’s wrong to throw needless obstacles in front of women whose lives already contain more than enough of those.","['sadistic', 'bad']"
"The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-climate-change-philanthropy-has-quite-few-hidden-strings-ncna1143791?cid=public-rss_20200228,msnbc,environment,left,16.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Feb. 17, Amazon CEO and occasional richest-man-in-the-world Jeff Bezos announced he was committing $10 billion — 7 to 8 percent of his massive fortune — to an initiative to combat climate change, dubbed the Bezos Earth Fund. Exactly how the funds will be distributed remains to be seen, but Bezos claims money will start flowing this summer in the form of grants to scientists, activists and nonprofit groups for ""any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world."" It's quite a reversal for the billionaire, who once declared, ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.""
Bezos' change of heart aligns him with other powerful people. Last year, former Republican New York mayor and current candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Mike Bloomberg pledged $500 million to shut down coal plants across the United States. Goldman Sachs, the reviled investment bank, said it will invest $750 billion in ""sustainable finance projects"" over 10 years. And earlier this month, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has around $47 billion in its ever-growing endowment, added climate change to its philanthropic priorities.
It might seem that having wealthy individuals and multinational corporations promising so much money for climate initiatives would be a good thing. But it's much more complicated than just rich people trying to make the planet a better place. Anand Giridharadas, author of ""Winner Takes All,"" has emerged as one of the chief critics of this recent spate of billionaire philanthropy. Giridharadas writes that for all their talk of changing the world through charitable giving, what elites offer is a ""fake change"" that seeks ""to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix — and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.""

In practice, that means it's hard to trust Bezos' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal. Its push for ever-faster delivery times, as little as one to two days in parts of the country, also comes with an environmental cost.
Then there's the bigger question of why philanthropists are suddenly focusing on the environment. Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action. In the United States, President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, rolled back plenty of environmental regulations and opened Alaska's wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, among other backward measures, but even officials at the lower levels of government aren't doing enough.
Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors is that government has failed to take bold action.
But U.S. officials are far from the only offenders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got some good press for implementing a carbon tax, but his government isn't on track to meet its Paris targets, either. Canada also nationalized a pipeline that would increase emissions and facilitate an expansion of Alberta's oil sands, and it is still dealing with crippling rail blockades after federal police forced indigenous land defenders out of the way of yet another pipeline. Meanwhile, politicians in Australia's right-wing government continue to oppose climate action, even in the face of record fires, and the European Union is funding new gas projects despite declaring a climate emergency.
But this lack of vision is not inherent to the public sphere. Rather, Giridharadas argues, it's the product of a broken system captured by notions of ""business fundamentalism"" and ""market worship,"" in which even those in the public sector believe that the capitalist class must chart the path forward. This is largely the product of a mindset promoted by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and brought into the Democratic Party by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which devalues the role of government in favor of the private sector.
In 2019, the 500 richest people in the world increased their wealth by $1.2 trillion, an increase of 25 percent in a single year. Also relevant: The richest 10 percent of people worldwide are responsible for nearly half of global emissions. Yet the tax rate paid by American billionaires fell below that of the working class in 2018 — and all their philanthropy actually reduces the tax they pay. Amazon, one of the most valuable companies in the world, paid no federal tax in 2018, instead receiving a $129 million tax refund.
That transfer of wealth has limited the ability of government to respond to social problems while increasing the economic power of billionaires. To some, that may seem like a good thing — we've been told for decades that the private sector is more efficient. But as Giridharadas says: ""There is enormous moral difference between five guys deciding to do something and a city deciding to do something. This is something I think you wouldn't have had to explain to people 100 years or 200 years ago when we actually had more faith in the idea of democratic action."" By leaving so much to billionaires, democracy is eroded.
The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations. In the past, large-scale social and economic transformations have always required government action, whether it was $500 billion to build the Interstate highway system, the creation of the Federal Housing Authority to subsidize homeownership and the suburbanization of the country or, as Sen. Bernie Sanders talked about recently at CNN's Nevada town hall, the restructuring of the U.S. economy to defeat fascism in World War II. These kinds of massive structural changes could not be accomplished by the private sector alone; Bezos' $10 billion wouldn't even cover the cost of New York City's Second Avenue Subway line, let alone a large-scale transformation of the entire country.
This is because, as Giridharadas writes, ""changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up."" That something is the power and wealth billionaires have derived from an economy that privileges growth at all costs and has caused inequality to soar and accelerated the climate crisis. But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society. They profit from the world as it is, not as it could be.
That's why billionaires' donations will never be enough. The highways, the suburbs and the victory against the Nazis — just to provide a few examples — are products not of the private sector but of government action. Through state spending, regulatory powers and the tax code, the government set the framework and priorities that businesses then responded to — and if we have any hope of cutting emissions in half by 2030, as the scientists tell us we need to do, we'll need the government to use its power to reset the rules once again.
The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place. For that, we need the government to redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, change the tax code to penalize unsustainable industries, alter regulations to encourage denser development and ultimately set a framework that's more favorable to workers and communities that have been left behind these past few decades. That's why, regardless of what billionaires do, we need a Green New Deal to chart the path forward.",['immense']
"Activists planning to line California roadways with anti-vaccination billboards full of misinformation are paying for them through Facebook fundraisers, despite a platform-wide crackdown on such campaigns.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/anti-vaccination-groups-still-crowdfunding-facebook-despite-crackdown-n1064981,msnbc,vaccines,left,16.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Activists planning to line California roadways with anti-vaccination billboards full of misinformation are paying for them through Facebook fundraisers, despite a platform-wide crackdown on such campaigns.
According to organizers, the billboards will feature the faces of two children whose parents claim were killed by vaccines, though the claims are contrary to medical evidence. Catelin Clobes, the mother of one of the pictured children, raised $16,304 for the campaign through 491 Facebook users and says the funds have paid for billboards in Modesto, Sacramento and Merced, the first of which is set to go up this month.
The billboards will include the website address for the Informed Consent Action Network, the nation’s best-funded anti-vaccination group. Del Bigtree, the former daytime television producer who leads the group, told NBC News he was unaware of the campaign.
Clobes’ fundraiser is one of dozens on Facebook that have raised money recently for anti-vaccination campaigns and nonprofits, despite the company’s announcement in April of a restriction on vaccine misinformation fundraising. At least $27,000 has been raised on Facebook in the last six months for such efforts.
Recent campaigns have funded billboards and bus signs, organized anti-vaccination events and paid for the maintenance of what’s known as the “Vaxxed Bus,” an RV emblazoned with the title of an anti-vaccination documentary that prominent anti-vaccination activists used to travel on a nationwide tour.
The fundraisers underscore the challenge of content moderation on Facebook’s massive scale, where hundreds of millions of people post billions of times each week. While Facebook’s crackdown halted fundraising for the biggest anti-vaccination groups on the platform, smaller groups and individual fundraisers have fallen through the cracks, NBC News found.

Facebook responded to questions from NBC News about several active anti-vaccination campaigns by closing one fundraiser, but many remain.
""We partner with leading public health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which have publicly identified verifiable vaccine hoaxes,” a Facebook spokesperson wrote in an email to NBC News. “If these vaccine hoaxes appear on Facebook, we will take action against them, including the removal of access to our fundraising tools.""
Public health officials say the science on vaccines is clear: They are both safe and essential to protecting the health of vulnerable populations, including infants and the elderly. The ideas promoted by anti-vaccination groups — which rely on pseudoscience and conspiracy theories about the government and pharmaceutical companies — are false.
The current anti-vaccination movement was built on Facebook and other social media platforms, as well as crowdfunding sites, which spread their message and financed their various campaigns. But in recent months — amid rising concern over vaccine hesitancy and the worst measles outbreak in decades — the platforms that amplified and funded a conspiracy movement have taken steps to muzzle it.
Following similar decisions by Pinterest and YouTube, Facebook announced in March that it would limit the reach of anti-vaccination content, no longer serve up anti-vaccination groups and pages in search results and the recommendations bar, and stop accepting ad buys from users and groups that spread vaccine misinformation. Then, in April, after GoFundMe and Indiegogo both banned anti-vaccine campaigns, Facebook widened its anti-vaccination restrictions to include fundraising.
Facebook soon removed the largest anti-vaccination groups from its list of nonprofits eligible to receive fundraising donations. In 2018, prominent anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy’s Children's Health Defense fund raised $30,000 on the platform, and a month before Facebook’s announcement, activist Brandy Vaughan raised more than $8,000 for a billboard campaign from her anti-vaccination group, the Council for Vaccine Safety. Today, both groups are no longer listed among Facebook’s eligible nonprofits.
The donation pages for other anti-vaccination groups that once raised funds through Facebook, including Bigtree’s Informed Consent Action Network and Physicians for Informed Consent, currently read, “This content is no longer available.”
While the largest anti-vaccination groups have been effectively cut off, smaller individual activists who make up the movement have responded with creative workarounds. Many have continued to host fundraisers through the platform, concealing the nature of their campaign to evade Facebook’s enforcement, swapping the word “vaccines” for terms like “medical freedom” or “informed choice.” Other groups, including National Vaccine Information Center, the country’s oldest anti-vaccination nonprofit with more than 218,000 Facebook “likes,” have used outside services that manipulate Facebook’s layout to include custom donation tabs on their page.
“The harder platforms go with bans, the harder users will go to circumvent those bans,” said Ysabel Gerrard, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield’s Department of Sociological Studies, who researches content moderation and sits on Facebook's Suicide and Self-Injury Advisory Board.
Evading moderators “becomes a pleasurable cat-and-mouse game,” Gerrard said. “Communications become more insular and more niche, and you add a new level of pleasure when you ban something.”
“The people who are really hardcore into a community will evade bans,” Gerrard added. “But moderating hopefully restricts new people from finding the community.”
Six personal fundraisers on Facebook are currently raising money for First Freedoms, a nonprofit led by the author of a prominent anti-vaccination book that falsely alleges vaccines are dangerous and the CDC has conspired with pharmaceutical companies and the American Academy of Pediatrics to keep that information from the public.
First Freedoms has raised thousands of dollars on the platform in recent months for a campaign to keep religious exemptions to vaccines intact in New York State. Its page is loaded with videos that push vaccine conspiracies, including that the CDC over-hypes measles outbreaks to scare the public and that New York’s exemption legislation is fueled by an “unholy alliance between the pharmaceutical industry and government.”
The fundraiser that Facebook closed after NBC News’ questions was on behalf of the anti-vaccination group Informed Choice Michigan, which was using Facebook to fund an upcoming event. “The V word was never even used in any of the posts we made to the fundraiser!” the page’s administrator wrote. “Censorship is real people!”
In an email to NBC News, Facebook said the fundraiser violated policies unrelated to vaccines.","['misinformation', 'full', 'of', 'anti-vaccination']"

HOUSTON — It’s Sage’s fifth birthday. She’s wearing a pin that tells the world, and she’s carrying a sign, too.
“Today is my 5th B-day,” it reads. “Denied school because I don’t have 39 vaccines.”
Sage’s mom, Dene Shulze-Alva, has brought her to Houston from Los Angeles to protest against vaccine laws. She’s refused to vaccinate her children and is upset that means they soon will not be able to enroll in any school in California.

She’s among four dozen or so people gathered outside on a hot late-summer morning, joining a hard core of activists who believe that all vaccines are dangerous and who have become increasingly emboldened about denouncing the medical establishment.
So Sage is spending her birthday on a narrow verge of grass in front of a Houston hotel, waving signs on a highway overpass as traffic passes by.
“Look at her. She’s 5. She’s maybe 28 pounds. I can’t inject her with the dose they are requiring,” says Shulze-Alva, a chiropractor.
None of her children are fully vaccinated, says Shulze-Alve, who smiles pleasantly and patiently lays out her arguments. And now California has eliminated personal belief and religious exemptions for vaccination, meaning children may not enroll in school if they are unvaccinated unless they have a valid medical reason.
The state tightened restrictions after a measles outbreak in 2014-15 sickened 131 people in the state and 147 nationally. State health officials said the virus was imported by a traveler, but took hold and spread among pockets of people who had unvaccinated or undervaccinated children.
“We are forced into home schooling. Sage cannot enroll in any school,” says Shulze-Alva.

Vaccine skeptics aren't new.
“Being anti-vaccine goes back to the time of Jenner,” says Dr. James Cherry, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Edward Jenner started immunizing people against smallpox in 1796. Once a killer of millions, smallpox was eradicated 200 years later after a global vaccination push.
“We are forced into home schooling.""
But the skeptics have taken on a brasher, bolder tone in recent months. They once argued that they were only for safer vaccines, but an increasing number now say most or all vaccines are dangerous, and some accuse the federal government, physicians and the “mainstream” media of colluding with drug companies to deliberately poison children using vaccines.
“It is really reaching a new level,” says Dr. Susan Wootton, associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.
“The anti-vaccine movement is a different beast in 2017 because of the rapidity with which these false stories get propagated (with) the power of the anecdote.”

There are plenty of anecdotes to go around on this hot, humid Texas morning.
Paula Bryant of Oregon said her 17-year old daughter is profoundly disabled with autism and she blames vaccines given to the child at 18 months.
“I can’t say what caused it. I can only say that three days later she could barely function,” she said.
Bryant took her daughter to a practitioner who told her the girl’s blood was full of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, antimony and mercury. “I wondered how she got it,” she added. “The government and the people who made these vaccines know there is a dark side.”

Many of the demonstrators say they regularly fly from around the country, taking time away from work or family, to hold up signs and to step into a large bus to record video testimonials later posted on social media.
They were summoned to this particular demonstration on social media. “This is a CALL TO ACTION! Unite with us around the country and around the world! War has been waged on humanity!” declares one announcement on the We Are Vaxxed Facebook page.

“This is a runaway train,” says Tammy Johns, a life coach with three daughters who lives in the Bay Area of San Francisco. She blames her daughter’s ear infections, bronchitis, asthma and diarrhea on vaccines and rejects arguments that failure to vaccinate children puts other kids at risk.
“My first doctor bullied me,” says Johns. “He kept leading me to the (American Academy of Pediatrics) website. He said he wouldn’t see me when we refused vaccines. We just get shut down.”
Some decline to give their full names or home towns, saying they fear disapproval from friends, family or employers.
“There are some patients you are never going to convince.""
“I personally had a reaction to a tetanus shot,” says Ashley, a young woman from Lake Charles, Louisiana. ""I got rashes. I had ulcers,"" she says. ""I had three miscarriages.""
The atmosphere is friendly, relaxed and mostly polite, and they’re eager to share what they believe to be unique insights gained by spending hours on the internet.
“They know more about vaccine science than many pediatricians do,” says Dr. Jim Meehan, a former Oklahoma ophthalmologist who says he now practices “wellness” and who wanders among the demonstrators.
“You can’t rely on physicians who haven’t done their own research,” adds Meehan, who freely admits that as an eye specialist he had little formal training in vaccine science, immunology, or infectious disease.
Related: Vaccine Rumors Fueled Measles Outbreak That Put Kids in Hospital
Meehan claims that vaccines have not eradicated diseases and that many infections, such as measles, are largely harmless. He says vaccines contain dangerous additives and that testing has neglected to account for the effects of these additives.
For the record, all these claims have been repeatedly refuted. But this group doesn’t trust the debunkers, whether they’re from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, American Academy of Family Physicians, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases or the World Health Organization.
“There are some patients you are never going to convince,” said Wootton.
Johns is among those who are not convinced.
“Those who are proponents of vaccines say correlation doesn’t equal causation. But then you can’t say the same thing about vaccines – that vaccines save lives,” says Johns. Like many of the demonstrators, she dismisses the hundreds of medical studies from around the world that demonstrate that vaccines have stopped epidemics, saved millions of lives, prevented disease and are much safer than the diseases they prevent.
“Show me the kids that are not getting vaccinated that are passing on the illness and are killing people. Where are all these deadly outbreaks?” Johns demands. She need only look to Italy, where researchers reported earlier this month that low vaccination rates have caused an an epidemic of measles, with more than 4,400 cases and three deaths since January.
Another new argument — personal freedom.
“For example, our anti-vaccine movement here, Texans for Vaccine Choice, they have their own PAC now,” said Wootton. A PAC is a political action committee, which pools campaign donations for or against candidates or legislation.
“We all want to protect our kids, whether you are anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine.”
The group is lobbying against legislation that would stop parents from being able to enroll their kids in Texas schools without required vaccinations because of philosophical or religious objections.
“It’s choice of sovereignty over our own personal property,” said Sheila Hemphill, a registered lobbyist for Texas Right to Know, another group pushing to loosen vaccine requirements.
“If we turn our nation into a ‘show me your papers’ country, what will come next is forced chipping, like an animal.”
Related: Don't Call Vaccine Doubters Dumb
Meehan alleges cover-ups by media, the federal government and by the medical establishment fueled, he says, by pharmaceutical company dollars. “So much money is poured into mainstream media sources. You will have senior editors trying to suppress this information,” he predicted.
UCLA’s Cherry is not surprised by these arguments. “You can’t present some people with facts, because they believe what they want to believe,” he said. “When there is an obvious fact, they’ll stick with what they believed before rather than accepting the fact.”
Studies support this assertion, also. Much research has shown that debunking myths usually serves to strengthen the incorrect beliefs, not to weaken them.

Johns has found providers who do not argue with her. “Now I see doctors who are awake, who honor informed consent,” she said.
Many of the demonstrators also decline to name their providers, or even say what their credentials are. They worry the providers might lose licenses, be censured or fined for operating outside state medical guidelines.
“If you go to enough doctors, you will find one who tells you what you want to hear,” Wootton said.
Wootton said pediatricians may not be helping by refusing to treat unvaccinated children.

“There’s a lot of debate in our field about whether to dismiss them from our clinics. I think we should keep them in our clinics to provide them high-quality care,” she said.
And she’s sympathetic to parents who see the websites, Facebook pages and other social media messages and worry about whether the vaccine skeptics are on to something.
“They are just scared and they are trying to make the right decision for their kids and we can all empathize with them,” she said. “We all want to protect our kids, whether you are anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine.”","['hard', 'core', 'emboldened']"
Bevin’s downplaying of the necessity of vaccines is reckless — but deliberately infecting his children is much more so.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/this-gop-governor-just-said-he-deliberately-infected-his-children-with-chickenpox-while-defending-vaccine-exemptions/,alternet,vaccines,left,17.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY) told WKCT radio on Tuesday that he opposes mandating vaccines to send children to school — and as evidence that there are alternatives, explained that he had deliberately infected his children with chickenpox.
Bevin, who has nine kids including four who were adopted, explained that after contracting the virus, they were “miserable for a few days” but “they all turned out fine.” He added that parents should vaccinate if they are afraid of the disease, but that we shouldn’t make it compulsory.
Bevin’s downplaying of the necessity of vaccines is reckless — but deliberately infecting his children is much more so. Though most children who suffer from chickenpox recover with no problems and never get the disease again, in severe cases it can cause pneumonia, bleeding, sepsis, encephalitis, and in some cases can be fatal. Bevin has also put his children at risk of developing shingles in later life, a painful rash caused by the dormant Varicella virus reactivating.
Before the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995, there were around 4 million cases of the disease every year, with up to 18,000 hospitalizations and 100-150 deaths. Despite the risks, “chickenpox parties” like Bevin’s used to be fairly common, with parents who believed the disease was inevitable deliberately infecting their children young so they wouldn’t get the disease as adults when it is much more dangerous.
Even before the vaccine was developed, deliberately infecting children was a dice roll with their health. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes clear that it “strongly recommends against hosting or participating in these events. Chickenpox can be serious and can lead to severe complications and death, even in healthy children. There is no way to tell in advance how severe your child’s symptoms will be. So it is not worth taking the chance of exposing your child to someone with the disease. The best way to protect infants and children against chickenpox is to get them vaccinated.”
But in an age when anti-vaccine conspiracy theories travel far and wide online and many parents are afraid of taking their pediatrician’s advice, Kentucky’s loose vaccination laws directly incentivize parents to follow Bevin’s lead. In Kentucky, parents who want to send unvaccinated kids to school can obtain a religious exemption, or provide proof that their childen have already had the disease — which all but invites parents to use chickenpox parties as an alternative if they erroneously oppose vaccines.
Bevin has shown his lack of concern for children’s safety on previous occasions. In January, during a deadly cold snap that plunged temperatures in Kentucky to below zero, Bevin scorned the decision of public schools to shut down, saying “we’re getting soft” and that we shouldn’t be teaching children that “you can curl up in the fetal position somewhere in a warm place and just wait until it stops being hard.” Evidently, Bevin never stopped to think that many children walk to school, and would be risking frostbite and hypothermia.
Kentucky is one of three states that holds gubernatorial elections in 2019, along with Louisiana and Mississippi. Bevin, who is highly unpopular despite the state’s deeply conservative lean, faces a tough re-election battle, with GOP state Rep. Robert Goforth challenging him in the primary and Democratic state Attorney General Andy Beshear, state House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins, and former state auditor Adam Edelen vying to take him on in the general election.","['reckless', 'deliberately', 'downplaying']"
"Amanda Kifferly, vice president of abortion access for The Women’s Centers, explained that she’s seeing some of the ways that the coronavirus is making it harder for women to get an abortion, which was already difficult because of all the needless bureaucratic obstacles put in place by conservative legislators.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/the-pandemic-has-triggered-an-abortion-crisis/,alternet,abortion,left,17.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As soon as stay-at-home orders came down across the country, a number of Republican-controlled states tried to argue that abortion was a “non-essential” service and that women who want abortions could just wait until the pandemic was over. That’s a blatantly false and cruel argument. Trying to bar women from abortion is bad enough in regular times, but it seemed even more sadistic during a pandemic and an economic crash, when financial and health concerns weigh more heavily than ever on women deciding whether or not continue pregnancies.
As the opportunistic abortion bans are fought over in the courts, we now have hard numbers showing how much the need for abortion — and for financial support for abortion services — has risen during the coronavirus pandemic.
“There are absolutely increases in calls for help, and that’s compounded by the complexity and difficulty in getting to care,” Yamani Hernandez, executive director for the National Network of Abortion Funds, told Salon.
Abortion funds operate by giving financial and other forms of assistance, such as housing and transportation, to women seeking abortions. Some of these groups are seeing sharp increases in women seeking help. Tampa Bay Abortion Fund saw a 30% increase in callers in April. Chicago Abortion Fund saw a 35% increase in callers in March and April. Funds in Ohio and Texas have doubled their spending limits, and in Texas, at least, are still exceeding them.
Meg Sasse Stern, who directs the abortion fund for the Kentucky Health Justice Network, told Salon that her group has seen an uptick of calls but believes it’s going to increase dramatically over the summer.
She suggested the increase “was delayed because of initial shock and stress,” saying that some women put off having an abortion at the beginning of the lockdown period. Now that lockdowns have dragged on for seven or eight weeks in most places, getting what is obviously a time-sensitive procedure like abortion is now much harder and, for some women, more expensive as well.
The delays women are experiencing, Sasse Stern explained, are understandable. Low-income Kentucky women, who often live in rural areas, already face serious financial and domestic obstacles to getting abortion, and the pandemic has made the situation far worse.
“If someone does not have access to a reliable vehicle or a supportive companion, their ability to travel across the state becomes a lot more complex,” she explained.
“In the past, we would be able to offer up a ride with one of our volunteers, and we cannot do that now,” she continued, noting that the fund is not comfortable with asking volunteers to risk contracting the coronavirus by giving rides.
Sasse Stern also explained that “child care has become a more complicated barrier,” as stay-at-home orders make it far more difficult for women to find someone who can babysit their children for the hours — or days — it may take for them to travel somewhere and get an abortion.
Subsequently, many women may be experiencing delays that push them into the second trimester, where abortion becomes both more expensive and a more intensive procedure.
Amanda Kifferly, vice president of abortion access for The Women’s Centers — which operate in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Georgia — explained that she’s seeing some of the ways that the coronavirus is making it harder for women to get an abortion, which was already difficult because of all the needless bureaucratic obstacles put in place by conservative legislators.
One patient, she explained, had insurance coverage for abortion, but getting it approved required a referral. Even that, which involved a visit to a second office, is a step that’s become much more fraught in the era of coronavirus, especially when health care centers who may have treated infected people seem especially risky.
Kifferly said she hoped that the obstacles to getting any kind of medical care under these conditions, much less a time-sensitive procedure like abortion, would help highlight the need for more access to telemedicine.
Early in pregnancy, women can abort safely with telemedicine by consulting a doctor on video chat or the phone, and having abortion pills prescribed for mail delivery. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that “telemedicine is safe, effective, highly acceptable to patients, and facilitates access to care for women in rural areas.”
But now even women who live in cities and are close to an abortion clinic might want the telemedicine option so they don’t have to manage pandemic-created obstacles or visit a clinic where they fear exposure to the coronavirus.
“We had had our eyes set” on expanding access to telemedicine, Kifferly said. “It’s in line with the way that we feel about abortion,” which is that it should be accessible to all without needless delays or restrictions.
The pandemic has made it easier, she said, “to not only bridge the conversation with politicians, but also with media and with patients,” by clarifying why it’s so important for people to have access to medical care without leaving home whenever that’s a practical option.
The anti-choice movement has long depicted women who need abortions as careless or lazy, as a way to justify restrictions on access. But during this pandemic, more Americans are seeing how a medical emergency can upend your life, and perhaps understanding that it’s not always so easy to juggle transportation, child care, and employment. Maybe this period of universal turmoil will increase empathy for women who need abortions — not just during the pandemic but into the future — and increased awareness of why it’s wrong to throw needless obstacles in front of women whose lives already contain more than enough of those.","['needless', 'bureaucratic', 'obstacles']"
"By threatening the kids and their families with deportation, the administration’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was effectively delivering death sentences.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-admin-backs-plan-deport-critically-ill-children,msnbc,immigration,left,17.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It was about a month ago when we first learned that the Trump administration was threatening critically ill children with deportation. As regular readers may recall, it was almost hard to believe.
For all of Donald Trump’s talk about targeting “bad hombres” to keep Americans safe, in this case, his administration was targeting children receiving treatment for life-threatening ailments who’d been granted “medical deferred action.” By threatening the kids and their families with deportation, the administration’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was effectively delivering death sentences.
The policy was almost cartoonish in its malevolence. Even critics of the Republican White House, who’ve come to expect the worst from Trump and his team, were taken aback by the reports. These families were told they had 33 days to leave the country. There was no opportunity to appeal or challenge the decision.
As Rachel noted at the top of last night’s show, the policy in question is no more.
The Trump administration formally backed away from plans to deport critically ill immigrant children in a notification sent to Congress Thursday. In a letter sent to the House Oversight Committee, the Department of Homeland Security said that it is “resuming its consideration of non-military deferred action requests on a discretionary, case-by-case basis.”
If this sounds familiar, it’s because the administration seemed to back off a couple of weeks ago, but the shift left a series of unanswered questions, including the program’s uncertain future. Those questions appear to have been answered – and Team Trump’s reversal is complete.
It’s probably not a coincidence that the House Oversight Committee was slated to hold a hearing next week on the administration’s cruelty, which immigration officials were likely going to have a hard time defending.
As for the road ahead, some congressional Democrats have expressed an ongoing interest in determining who, exactly, thought deporting sick children would be a good idea, and what problem the administration was trying to solve.
It’s not unreasonable to expect some answers.","['threatening', 'delivering', 'death', 'sentences']"
"Rather than help be a part of the solution, Trump is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-brutalizing-protesters-would-save-him-he-was-wrong/,alternet,elections-2020,left,17.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['intentionally', 'exacerbating', 'racist', 'authoritarian', 'white', 'grievance', 'desperate', 'grave', 'peril']"

"Newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his individual dissent urging the law to go into effect, tipped his hand, Litman continues — he will rely on “flimsy distinctions” and “ostensibly procedural obstacles” to make obtaining an abortion impossible in states that desire to do so.",https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/596280522/0/alternet_all~This-law-professor-explains-the-Supreme-Court%e2%80%99s-plan-to-kill-abortion-rights/,alternet,abortion,left,18.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"On Thursday evening, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court blocked Louisiana’s harsh abortion restrictions from taking effect. The Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, already on hold since 2014, is basically identical to the Texas law requiring abortion clinics obtain admitting privileges from nearby hospitals — which was struck down in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt as an undue burden on women seeking abortion in 2016. Chief Justice John Roberts, who dissented from Whole Woman’s Health, nevertheless was unwilling to underhandedly blow up Supreme Court precedent on an emergency appeal just two years after that precedent was set, and so sided with the liberal justices.
This decision is unlikely to be the end of the Louisiana case, as the Supreme Court could reconsider it next term. But even if this win holds, the case shows the plan of attack that the justices, and right-wing legal activists, could use to neuter Roe v. Wade, cautions law professor Leah Litman in a new Washington Post editorial.
“The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit maintained that the burdens imposed by Louisiana’s admitting privileges requirement are less severe than the burdens imposed by the same requirement in Texas,” writes Litman. “The Texas law would have shuttered some 20 clinics, whereas Louisiana’s law would shutter only one or two of the state’s three clinics. Similarly, the 5th Circuit acknowledged that it did not have any evidence that the Louisiana admitting-privileges requirement would help the health or safety of any women, even though it created a burden on providers and their patients. That is the standard the Supreme Court set in the Texas case for when a law is unconstitutional, but the court of appeals said that it could imagine how it might be plausible to think the requirement might benefit some women.”
And that, says Litman, is the perfect cover for conservative judges to use for the next novel anti-abortion regulation that comes along. “If a law does not amount to an unconstitutional burden unless it does something as dramatic as close 20 clinics in a geographic area as large as Texas, almost every law would be constitutional. And if a law does not amount to an unconstitutional burden if courts can invent a justification for it, then laws would be upheld even when there is no evidence that they would help any woman, ever.”
Roe v. Wade, she says, will die “not with a bang, but with a million little distinctions that judges will draw to limit the impact of any cases that invalidate restrictions on abortion. By voting to allow the Louisiana law to go into effect, four justices gave the okay to states and lower courts to limit Roe by whatever means necessary.”
Newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his individual dissent urging the law to go into effect, tipped his hand, Litman continues — he will rely on “flimsy distinctions” and “ostensibly procedural obstacles” to make obtaining an abortion impossible in states that desire to do so.
“At this point,” she concludes ominously, “the question is how long will Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stand between those four justices and an open season on Roe v. Wade, the rule of law and respect for precedent.”","['obstacles', 'abortion', 'flimsy', 'procedural', 'distinctions', 'ostensibly']"
"Almost all of this is gibberish; Trump still can’t speak coherently about California’s wildfires; and no officials in the Golden State ever conceded that he was “right” about the subject, because he wasn’t.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/his-environmental-record-trump-turns-greenhouse-gaslighting,msnbc,environment,left,18.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"After the White House announced plans for a presidential speech on the environment, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement, “Donald Trump is resorting to greenhouse gaslighting the public to try and cover-up the fact that he is the worst president in history for the environment, climate and public health.”
That’s a good line. It also happens to be true.
Before we talk about what Trump said on the subject, part of what made yesterday interesting was the fact that the Republican delivered remarks on the subject at all. The New York Times had an interesting behind-the-scenes report:
Reviewing new polling data, consultants working for President Trump’s 2020 campaign discovered an unsurprising obstacle to winning support from two key demographic groups, millennials and suburban women. And that was his record on the environment. But they also saw an opportunity. While the numbers showed that Mr. Trump was “never going to get” the type of voter who feels passionately about tackling climate change, a senior administration official who reviewed the polling said, there were moderate voters who liked the president’s economic policies and “just want to know that he’s being responsible” on environmental issues. So for nearly an hour in the East Room on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump sought to recast his administration’s record by describing what he called “America’s environmental leadership” under his command.
It’s easy to imagine an awkward conversation between the president and his political advisers who pressed him to give a speech on a subject he neither knows nor cares about. I can almost hear them telling Trump, “Just fake it for 46 minutes and it’ll help with some key constituencies.”
And so, he did.
The trouble, of course, is that it’s awfully tough to pretend that the president has a laudable record on the environment. It’s important that Team Trump considered this necessary – it’s emblematic of public attitudes shifting in a progressive direction – but he failed to make a compelling pitch because Trump had so little to work with.
It’s why the Republican was reduced to lying, over and over again. The White House went so far as to release a fairly brief “fact sheet” to tout Trump’s environmental record, and it included increased gas production as an accomplishment of note.
No, seriously.
I’d be remiss if I neglected to highlight my favorite part of Trump’s remarks:
“I spoke to certain countries, and they said, ‘Sir, we’re a forest nation.’ I never thought of a country – well-known countries: ‘We’re a forest nation.’ I never heard of the term ‘forest nation.’ They live in forests and they don’t have problems. “One was telling me that his trees are much more susceptible to fire than what they have in California, but they don’t have fires because they manage, they clean, they do what you have to do. There’s not so much to burn. And we’re going to start doing that. And it’s called, remember, ‘management.’ It’s called ‘forest management.’ So it’s a very important term. “When I went to California, they sort of scoffed at me for the first two weeks and maybe three weeks, and not so much — four weeks. And after about five weeks they said, ‘You know, he’s right. He’s right.’”
Almost all of this is gibberish; Trump still can’t speak coherently about California’s wildfires; and no officials in the Golden State ever conceded that he was “right” about the subject, because he wasn’t.
But if yesterday was any guide, we’ll hear the president say this many times in the coming months anyway, reality be damned.","['coherently', 'can’t', 'speak', 'gibberish']"
"Trump, who actually was his school’s team captain, has long claimed that he was the best athlete there, a boast rarely challenged because coaches and classmates tended to praise him once it became in their best interests to do so.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/what-trumps-imaginary-baseball-prowess-reveals-about-him/,alternet,sport,left,18.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"In 1964, an 18-year-old New York Military Academy first baseman named Don Trump slammed a game-winning home run against Cornwall High School that perked the interest of scouts for the Philadelphia Phillies and the Boston Red Sox. No question about it — the big kid was a professional prospect!
That same year, a 25-year-old New York Yankees pitcher named Jim Bouton, an All-Star the previous season, won two World Series games against the St. Louis Cardinals. Hall of Fame, here we come!
Neither of those hotshots fulfilled their baseball promise. Unpacking why not might just help us survive another day without baseball at a time when — thanks to that now grownup first-baseman — we really need the diversion. And it may remind us of what we’re missing.
As you may already have guessed, Don Trump was never really a pro prospect. That home run, in fact, would prove just a foretaste of his talent for hyping himself. It never happened. He made it up. In fact, his team didn’t even play Cornwall that year. Trump, who actually was his school’s team captain, has long claimed that he was the best athlete there, a boast rarely challenged because coaches and classmates tended to praise him once it became in their best interests to do so.
And what about that Yankee phenom, nicknamed “Bulldog” by his teammates (including legendary superstar Mickey Mantle) for his ferocious tenacity on the mound? Only six years after his World Series heroics, sportswriters would be furiously writing him off as a “journeyman” ballplayer, a “social leper” who had betrayed the game to produce a “tell-all” book written for him by a lefty journalist.
This year, Jim Bouton, who died in 2019 at age 80, will get more of the acclaim owed him as a revolutionary sports figure thanks to the publication of an excellent new biography and a forthcoming 50th anniversary Kindle edition of his memoir, Ball Four, arguably the best sports book of all time. In 1999, Ball Four was, in fact, selected by the New York Public Library as one of the “Books of the Century.”
Baseball Anthropology
Parts of Ball Four may now seem quaint. (Who would be shocked today to discover that ballplayers of that era actually cursed, popped amphetamines, or tried to peek at women through hotel windows?) In 1970, however, that book turned the national pastime on its head. Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn tried to have it banned or at least force Bouton to declare it “fiction.” Players who didn’t bother to read it nonetheless felt violated by it or were convinced that they should feel that way. Traditional sportswriters, whose status depended on the idea that they were the only conduit fans had to the true life of the locker-room, were infuriated. They had been exposed as faux insiders.
As former Wall Street Journal reporter (and sportswriter) Stefan Fatsis said, in retrospect, “I think you can argue that Ball Four completely reshaped journalism.”
No one who’s written about Bouton’s book, however, has caught its deeper spirit better than his widow, the psychologist Paula Kurman, in an introduction to that 50th anniversary edition. “Ball Four,” she wrote, “was an extraordinary study of a strange, isolated tribe—from inside the tribe—which any anthropologist would be proud to have authored. It was a universal fable, in which our hero sets out to seek his fortune, or the Holy Grail, and must do battle with those who try to stop him. It was a man from a macho world—openly talking about his feelings and insecurities. It was a kid calling out that the Emperor had no clothes on.”
For starters, it reshaped the perceptions that many sports fans then had of their heroes. It humanized them. Not surprisingly, the book spent months on the bestseller list, less for its mildly bawdy anecdotes than for the way it reinforced the passion of baseball fans for their game. Rigorously edited (but not written) by Leonard Shecter, a progressive, uncompromising veteran of the pre-Murdoch-era New York Post, Ball Four was a strange and unexpected valentine to what was still the national pastime then. (Today, it’s undoubtedly football, a tribute to American brutality.)
Bouton’s book proved to be the sweet revelation of a True Believer’s longing to get a tighter hold on a game that had entranced him as a young man, a hold as tight as the game had on him. Even now, it feels like a warm hug and helps explain why baseball is still America’s best game, a contest without a time limit or strategic violence, a sport that adds up to a true guild of disparate talents only capable of succeeding by working collectively (no matter the mix of workingmen, thugs, and poets on the field). Think of it as a sort of dream version of America.
As it happened, however, it was a glimpse into Mickey Mantle’s alcoholism that especially upset the establishment. As Bouton told Neal Conan of NPR’s Talk of the Nation in 2012, Mantle showed up so hung over one day that the Yankee manager excused him from the game, telling him to sleep it off in the trainer’s room.
“Anyway, the game goes extra innings,” recalled Bouton. “We need a pinch-hitter in the 10th. Somebody went to wake up the Mick. He comes out, put a bat in his hands. He walks up to home plate, takes one practice swing and hits the first pitch into the left field bleachers, a tremendous blast.
“Guys are going nuts. He comes over, crosses home plate. Actually, he missed home plate. We have to send him back for that. He comes over to the dugout, and he looks up in the stands, and he says, those people don’t know how tough that really was. Then after the game, the sportswriter said, ‘Mick, how did you do that?’… And he said, ‘Well, it was very simple. I hit the middle ball.'”
For Bouton, that anecdote was his almost fanboy way of showcasing the greatness of Mantle. But for the sports establishment, media and otherwise, it represented a loss of control, a peek into the deeper reality of the game and of the human beings that made it what it was. They were particularly upset at how Bouton exposed their greed, at how many now knew how little the owners paid all but a few of their players compared to their profits. The largest salary Bouton ever earned from the Yankees was $30,000 in 1965, the year after his World Series wins, and he had to refuse to sign his contract and hold out to get it. All of this would, of course, seem far less shocking in the world of 2020 with the billionaire first-baseman who specialized in bankruptcies in the White House and a country that, in the midst of a pandemic and the equivalent of the second Great Depression, managed to make its collective crew of billionaires $565 billion richer.
Most important, Bouton’s book laid bare the unfairness of baseball’s reserve clause, which bound players to their owners in something like perpetuity. As Kevin Baxter pointed out in the Los Angeles Times, “Ball Four, fortuitously for the players union, came out the same year that St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood challenged the reserve clause by refusing to accept a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies, setting off a legal battle that eventually led to free agency. Bouton played a part in that, too, when he was called to read passages from his book in front of arbitrator Peter Seitz, who eventually ruled in the player’s favor.”
He would also prove to be a rare sports activist outside the game. He marched for civil rights at a time when most athletes kept their political heads down. He participated in anti-apartheid demonstrations against South Africa’s white regime when most ballplayers didn’t know what the word meant. He was even a George McGovern delegate from New Jersey, his home state, at the 1972 Democratic convention.
The Knuckleballer
As a player, Bouton was an unusually friendly and accessible locker-room interviewee, even for sportswriters whose hostility to him was guaranteed to find its way into print. The most affronted and belligerent of these was the controversial, right-wing New York Daily News columnist Dick Young, who claimed that Bouton had violated the sanctity of the locker room (a transgression for which he gave only himself a pass). He was the one who described Bouton as a “social leper.” When the pitcher greeted him amiably afterward, Young blurted out, “I’m glad you didn’t take it personally” (though it couldn’t have been more personally meant). That became the title of Bouton’s sequel to Ball Four.
Overused by the Yankees, he would injure his arm in his fourth season and never regain the dominance of his early Bulldog days. In a major league career that lasted 10 seasons, he would play for three more teams, trying to develop and perfect a knuckleball, a difficult pitch to deliver, without notable success. He would then go on to a successful career as a TV sportscaster and then an entrepreneur and motivational speaker. He would jokingly describe himself as a “medium celebrity,” at about the time in the 1980s when Donald Trump first made it onto the B list of anyone who was anybody in New York City. It was a wonder they never met. His wife would later tell me that he “loathed Trump from the get-go,” but by the time he was angry enough to go on the attack, his verbal and literary skills had been dimmed by cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a brain disease.
As for me, while working at the New York Times and elsewhere, I interviewed and covered Trump for more than 35 years and Bouton for almost 60—we eventually became friends—and I can’t tell you how creepy it seems to me to put both of them in the same sentence, no less compare them. Yet they did have something in common. They were both creatures, if not creations, of the media, highly accessible and always eminently quotable. They were both suffered by journalists who didn’t like them because they were guaranteed to draw attention and provide instant colorful copy (as the president still does daily). And both were misinterpreted early.
Trump’s ponderous, dour personal style made him seem serious, almost thoughtful, when being interviewed. While it was clear enough that he had no ideology beyond making money and making his own will prevail, he was regularly characterized as a cunning man and so it was easy enough to assume that he had a master plan of some sort. In those years (as now), he schemed endlessly to attract attention, going so far then as to pretend to be a publicist, peddling his employer, one Donald Trump, while on the phone with reporters.
Bouton, on the other hand, rarely fished for publicity. He did, however, have a bubbly personality and a willingness to talk to anyone about anything, a manner that obscured the very thing he had and Donald Trump lacked: a methodical, rational mind with a highly developed sense of justice. Looking back, Paula Kurman thinks that a media tendency to characterize him as a classic tilter at windmills was a way of diminishing the passionate pragmatism of his activism. His last major quest was an attempt to save an old ballpark in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which he saw as a way to preserve history, be a gift to a city—he lived near neighboring Great Barrington—and make money. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the American world of inequality and greed we now inhabit, he struck out.
As he revealed in Ball Four, Bouton was an acute social observer (even if he also had a certain sense of elitism), mocking the dress of various ballplayers, their sloppy chewing-tobacco habits, even the way some feigned brave limps. That he could be seen as a flake was the clearest proof of how conservative, insular, and blinkered most ballplayers and reporters who covered them were, and how hidebound baseball still is.
Dueling Balls
Otherwise occupied, Trump has been quiet on baseball since he called for the opening of the new season in mid-April at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic as part of his drive to restart the economy at any human cost. Even though he once played the sport, it may be too intricate, humane, slow moving, and collective for a man with as little patience as he has. It’s unlikely he’s up to speed either on the current strained negotiations between the sport’s Trumpian owners and the players for some kind of a truncated version of a 2020 season.
Whether baseball has a season or not this year, chalk up a victory for The Donald in this time of death, destruction, and protest, one that would have amused the former Yankees pitcher. The last time I checked, a signed Jim Bouton baseball cost $64.99, while one with Trump’s signature was going for $5,565.79—only slightly less than the price for a document signed by the captain of the Titanic.

"In court and in public, the administration defended the extreme and disruptive measure being based on national security considerations, though it was clearly an instantiation of Trump’s bigoted campaign promise to end all Muslim immigration to the United States.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/conservative-magazine-denounces-trumps-cruel-expansion-of-his-muslim-ban/,alternet,immigration,left,18.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial had been wrapping up, he expanded one of his most controversial and inflammatory policies with little fanfare and minimal opposition: the travel ban on people from multiple Muslim-majority countries.
The previous version, which has been approved by the Supreme Court after it was rewritten multiple times, strictly barred immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela. In court and in public, the administration defended the extreme and disruptive measure being based on national security considerations, though it was clearly an instantiation of Trump’s bigoted campaign promise to end all Muslim immigration to the United States. When the ban was first enacted, it triggered chaos at airports and prompted widespread protest and legal challenges, and it continues to impose devastating costs on families and people who wish to come to the U.S.
Now, though, the ban has been expanded to include Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania, and the public reaction has been subdued. Perhaps this is because, given the Supreme Court gave it’s blessing on the previous version of the ban, opponents fear there is little that can be done to restrain Trump now.
But Daniel Larison, writing a piece for the magazine The American Conservative that denounced the policy as “cruel,” argued that the new expansion is transparently unnecessary.
“There is no legitimate security reason for such sweeping restrictions, and the new list seems like a grab-bag of countries that have large Muslim populations with nothing else linking them together,” he wrote. “Like previous versions of the ban, this is an attempt to use phony national security justifications to make changes to immigration policy that Congress wouldn’t approve.”
And Larison pointed out that there’s not even any evidence that Nigeria, or the other countries now targeted, export terrorism to the United States, which is ostensibly the reason for the ban. At the same time, a country that actually has seen its nationals commit terrorist acts in the U.S. — Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the Trump administration — is conspicuously missing from the list. Clearly, the point is just to limit immigration, even though Nigerian immigrants “have had great success in the U.S.,” Larison wrote.
New York Times Columnist Jamelle Bouie said that “the only explanation for adding Nigeria to the travel ban is as an act of racial control.”
“The entire expanded travel ban needs to be ended as soon as possible,” said Larison. “Rescinding this ban should be one of the first things that the next administration does.”","['disruptive', 'extreme', 'bigoted']"

Numerous polls show that religious Americans, like most other Americans, disapprove of the president’s performance, and that could imperil his re-election chances, reported the New York Times.
Nearly 80 percent of white evangelicals — a group that’s already shrinking as a share of the electorate — approved of Trump’s performance in March, but his handling of the coronavirus pandemic has bled 15 points from their support, according to a new poll from Public Religion Research Institute.
“He had an opportunity in March when people were looking to him,” said Robert Jones, the institute’s chief executive, “and then within four weeks he squandered it.”
Those losses could be offset by efforts from activist group’s such as Ralph Reed’s Christian Coalition, which plans to spend tens of millions of dollars to identify and register new religious conservative voters and rallying right-wing Christians.
And another PRRI poll from last year found that 31 percent of white evangelical voters said there was almost nothing Trump could do to lose their support.",['lurches']

"As the Republican Party is struggling to defend him in a moment of nationwide strife, President Donald Trump decided Thursday night to fuel divisions within GOP rather than make nice.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-stokes-division-in-his-own-party-as-he-rages-at-sen-lisa-murkowski/,alternet,elections-2020,left,18.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As the Republican Party is struggling to defend him in a moment of nationwide strife, President Donald Trump decided Thursday night to fuel divisions within GOP rather than make nice.
He had already lashed out on Wednesday at his former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who sharply criticized Trump’s response to the ongoing George Floyd protests. But on Thursday night, Trump took at aim at sitting Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
Murkowski had commended Mattis’s comments and said publicly that she is “struggling” with the decision of whether to support Trump in his re-election. She explained: “I feel like perhaps we’re getting to a point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally.”
The president did not appreciate this rebuke, mild as it may have been.
“Few people know where they’ll be in two years from now, but I do, in the Great State of Alaska (which I love) campaigning against Senator Lisa Murkowski. She voted against HealthCare, Justice Kavanaugh, and much else…” Trump said in a tweet. “Unrelated, I gave Alaska ANWR, major highways, and more. Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don’t care, I’m endorsing. If you have a pulse, I’m with you!”
As far as intra-party feuds that cross the executive and legislative branches go, a president pledging to campaign against a sitting senator is the most extreme possible salvo. While Trump surely hopes it will prevent any of Murkowski’s colleagues from joining her in dissent, it’s unlikely to cure the unease at the root of her concerns.
And in Murkowski’s case, it’s an unusually weak threat. Murkowski famously lost her 2010 GOP primary race in Alaska, but she won her Senate election anyway with an impressive write-in campaign. She’s thus much less reliant on the Republican Party for political power than many others, which may explain why she felt free to express her doubts in the first place. Nevertheless, it’s doubtless true that she’d rather not have Trump campaigning against her when she’s up for re-election if she can help it.","['divisions', 'strife', 'struggling', 'fuel', 'make', 'nice']"
But the fact that Trump cloaks this fact by stoking false fears about immigrant crime and delivering rage-filled rants about “illegal” immigration shows that this isn’t some genuine and reasoned policy view about the costs and benefits of new entrants to the labor force — it’s a reactionary stance built atop anti-immigrant bigotry.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/the-trump-administration-keeps-revealing-its-bigotry-against-immigration-even-if-its-legal/,alternet,immigration,left,18.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"One of the biggest lies told by many opponents of immigration is that they only stand against “illegal” immigration, while they fully support “legal” immigration. This line has been said repeatedly by defenders of President Donald Trump — I have frequently been scolded by readers who are unhappy with my characterization of him as “anti-immigrant.”
But this framing is fundamentally misleading because many Americans will assume that a given immigrant isn’t in the country legally based on racial and economic stereotypes, as suggested by a recent survey from Washington University.
And the Trump administration, like so many other opponents of immigration, has repeatedly made it clear that it hopes to reduce legal immigration to the United States. For example, the administration confirmed Tuesday that it is considering closing down 21 international offices of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which, as PBS NewsHour reporter Yamiche Alcindor explained, “could slow the processing of family visa applications.”
Vox reporter Dara Lind also pointed out that the new Trump budget released this week would hike fees on immigration application fees in the name of “deficit reduction,” though it would only raise an estimated $500 million over ten years.
“Half a billion dollars a year doesn’t do much to mitigate a projected $900 billion-and-growing deficit, which soared after the federal government passed a tax cut bill in 2017 (and did not reduce spending to meet it),” wrote Lind. “But to immigrants who already have to pay several hundred dollars for an application — and who often have to file multiple applications, to renew their immigration status or become green card holders or citizens — it’s an added burden.”
Of course, Trump already let the mask slip on his antipathy to legal immigration when he backed the “RAISE Act,” which would have cut legal immigration by about 50 percent. And his demagoguery around the Central American immigrant caravans and asylum-seekers continually obscure the fact that asking for asylum is an entirely legal form of immigration — even though Trump and his defenders now like to call it a “loophole.”
But in his 2019 State of the Union, Trump spooked some of his most fervent anti-immigrant supporters when he said, “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
As I said then, though, this was a clear lie. Nothing he’s done as president indicates an effort to increase legal immigration — which would, in theory, be quite easy to do. Trump’s record makes it obvious that he will work to limit even legal immigration — and his administration’s actions continue to bolster that conclusion. But the fact that he cloaks this fact by stoking false fears about immigrant crime and delivering rage-filled rants about “illegal” immigration shows that this isn’t some genuine and reasoned policy view about the costs and benefits of new entrants to the labor force — it’s a reactionary stance built atop anti-immigrant bigotry.","['cloaks', 'stoking', 'false', 'fears', 'rage-filled', 'rants', 'reactionary', 'bigotry', 'anti-immigrant']"
Celebrity Pseudoscience: Here Are Nine Household Names Who’ve Pushed Bad Science on The Public,https://www.alternet.org/2018/07/celebrity-pseudoscience-here-are-nine-household-names-whove-pushed-bad-science-public/,alternet,vaccines,left,19.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In our post-truth era, scientific illiteracy has morphed into science denialism. Today, people simply declare their own truths. As a consequence, science is losing its platform as a source of truth. Meanwhile, a pervasive celebrity culture — in which celebrities are considered trusted “experts” solely because of their fame — has poisoned the idea of what constitutes expertise.
Nowhere is the merger of these two trends more evident than in our embrace of “celebrity science,” which, because it often involves issues of health, might not only be misleading but harmful. Some celebrities actually do have science backgrounds; Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience, springs to mind. Unfortunately, many celebrities have waded into debates within fields in which they have neither expertise nor training, perhaps unintentionally injecting doubt into scientific certainty and often even harming public health efforts. Here are a few of the worst celebrity offenders
This article first appeared in Salon.
Anti-vaccine crusaders Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, Kristin Cavallari and Rob Schneider: The anti-vaccine crowd frequently falls back on the claim that vaccines cause autism, despite more than two dozen studies clearly showing that vaccination does not increase the incidence of autism. Nor did it make a whit of biological sense that vaccines would.
Gwyneth Paltrow: Paltrow is probably best known for her promotion of vaginal steaming, jade eggs and cleansing enemas. Paltrow believes that vaginal steaming with mugwort balances female hormones and cleanses the uterus. Apart from the fact that mugwort isn’t a hormone and vaginal steam will never reach the uterus, vaginal steaming can cause burns and bacterial infections. The jade eggs placed in the vagina to enhance muscle tone put users at risk of toxic shock syndrome, and the “toxin-removing” colonic enemas Paltrow prescribes, which have no proven benefit in otherwise healthy people, can cause dehydration, infections, vomiting and, worst of all, bowel perforations.
Suzanne Somers: Somers has become a one-woman industry, promoting megavitamins, supplements and minerals, as well as skin-care, weight-loss, and detoxification products on her website. When Somers says use her hormone replacement therapy because it’s “all natural” and isn’t going to cause the sort of problems that regular hormone replacement therapy cause, that’s bad advice. If a product causes a physiological response, it doesn’t matter whether it’s synthesized in a laboratory or derived from nature — it still has the same effect, which means that it can also have the same negative consequences. Also, antioxidants like Vitamin A, Vitamin E and the mineral selenium given in quantities vastly in excess of the recommended daily allowance actually increase the risk of cancer and heart disease.
Katie Couric: On Dec. 4, 2013, Katie Couric aired an episode that raised serious questions about the HPV vaccine. The show featured two mothers whose children had developed either a fatal heart arrhythmia or chronic fatigue syndrome following the vaccine. Couric’s mistake in this episode was the omission of more than a dozen studies performed on more than a million people showing that the vaccine doesn’t cause the problems claimed on her show. She never helped her viewers think through the difference between causal and coincidental associations. Katie Couric’s program only showed that the HPV vaccine doesn’t prevent fatal heart arrhythmias or chronic fatigue syndrome. It only prevents HPV infections.
Angry that she had chosen to scare parents away from a life-saving vaccine, the medical and scientific community rained down on Katie Couric, who later offered a weak, ineffective apology.
Steve Jobs: In 2011, Steve Jobs died from pancreatic cancer. However, Jobs didn’t have the type of cancer for which medicine had little to offer (adenocarcinoma); rather, he had a neuroendocrine tumor — a cancer that has a 95 percent chance of survival with early surgery. Unfortunately, instead of getting the surgery that might have saved his life, Jobs chose acupuncture, bowel cleansings and fruit juices. When he finally had surgery, it was too late. While one can’t blame him for his death, Jobs undoubtedly put himself at unnecessary risk by choosing an alternative course.
Donald J. Trump: Trump’s war against science is also a war against children. When a figurehead like Trump repeats the myth that vaccines cause autism, as he did during the presidential debates, many parents may choose not to vaccinate, putting children at unnecessary risk. When Trump denies climate change, which he stated unequivocally was a hoax, viruses like chikungunya and Dengue travel farther north, now entering states like Texas and Louisiana, causing more American children to suffer. Or when, by picking Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos, he says that creationism is as valid as evolution, children fail to learn important scientific facts in an age where scientific competitiveness with other countries is critical.
The Trump administration’s denial of climate change is reminiscent of the Church’s condemnation of Galileo for daring to say that the Earth wasn’t the center of the firmament, as stated in the Bible. When Galileo was taken away in chains he took a moment to look back at his accusers and say, regarding the Earth, “It still moves.” His point: You can lock me away, but that won’t change the facts. And the Trump administration can deny climate change, back out of the Paris Accords, and insist that the EPA remove the phrase “climate change” from its website. But that won’t change the facts. Human activity is changing our climate. “The good thing about science,” wrote Neil deGrasse Tyson, “is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.”
Although non-celebrity science might not have the glitz or pizzazz of celebrity science, it’s still your better bet. It’s OK to trust websites generated from university centers, hospitals and professional societies even though those who are doing the talking are probably less attractive and less interesting than the celebrities. One other thing: Avoid trusting sites that are selling something or that make claims that sound too good to be true

Sowers is an offensive assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers, whose win against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday secured the team's spot in the championship game Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The 49ers will face off against the Kansas City Chiefs.
She is the second woman to coach in the National Football League and began her athletic career playing in the Women’s Football Alliance for the West Michigan Mayhem and the Kansas City Titans. After retiring in 2016 because of a hip injury, Sowers joined the NFL as an intern for the Atlanta Falcons, and took the assistant coach position with the 49ers the next year.
Sowers became the first out gay coach in the NFL when she came out before the 2017 season.

“No matter what you do in life, one of the most important things is to be true to who you are,” she said in an interview with Outsports after coming out. “There are so many people who identify as LGBT in the NFL, as in any business, that do not feel comfortable being public about their sexual orientation.”
“By standing out and proud as the first-ever openly gay NFL coach in a Super Bowl, Katie Sowers not only shows LGBTQ athletes and fans what’s possible for them, but also shows the sport world as a whole that LGBTQ people are a valuable part of this community,” Joanna Hoffman, director of communications at the national LGBTQ athletic advocacy group Athlete Ally, wrote in an emailed statement.
“The more barriers we can break down in football and in all sports, the more LGBTQ athletes, coaches and fans will be able to be who they are and be a part of the sport they love.”
Despite achieving a historic position of leadership in the highest level of national football, Sowers said she experienced LGBTQ discrimination in sports while in college, when was rejected from a volunteer coaching job because of her “lifestyle.”
“I was so passionate about coaching and to feel like my opportunities were limited because of who I loved was hard to deal with,” Sowers told Outsports. “However, without that experience, I would not be where I am today.”
The incident encouraged the coach to use her platform to promote inclusivity. Sowers was in part responsible for the genesis of a Pride fan club for the 49ers last May, the first NFL team-sponsored group that officially recognized its LGBTQ fans. She also frequently posts pictures of her with her girlfriend on Instagram and talks about her experiences being a women's coach.
Athletes and fans are excited for Sowers' historic role at Super Bowl LIV and have remarked that her position is especially poignant given there have only been 13 out gay and bi players in the NFL's 100-year history, according to OutSports.

It is hard to argue that the highest income countries should not reduce their meat and dairy.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/nutritional-biochemist-examines-the-health-byproducts-associated-with-eating-sustainably/,alternet,environment,left,19.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Over the past two years, 37 experts from around the world have battled to develop a diet that is both sustainable and healthy. They integrated existing knowledge on the impact of diet on diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer, with the impact of current food production systems on the environment.
The result of this “EAT-Lancet Commission” is a seminal report, published on January 16, on Food in the Anthropocene. The diet they came up with is likely to split opinion, as it would fundamentally impact on many people’s daily lives. When comparing it to what is typically consumed in the UK, for instance, there are some dramatic changes recommended.
The one which has hit most of the headlines is a reduction in the consumption of red meat (beef, pork and lamb) from approximately 12% of total energy intake to a mere 1%. Poultry does a little better, but still falls by more than half, along with major reductions in the intake of fish, eggs and dairy produce. The potential impact diets in North America (the largest consumers of meat and dairy products) is even greater.
These animal products are to be replaced largely by nuts, pulses and legumes. While total intake of grains (wheat, rice and corn) remains largely unchanged, refined products are to be replaced by wholemeal varieties.
With veganuary fresh in the mind, such changes may not appear too radical. However, while social media may have us believe that vegetarianism, or even veganism, are becoming the norm, still only about 12% of the UK population follow a meat-free diet.
A healthier diet – for whom?
While there is little doubt that eating less red meat is good for your health, it is also important to recognise that for the poorest in society, meat and dairy products represent affordable sources of both calories and a range of micronutrients. In parts of the world where malnutrition is still common, increasing the availability of such products would certainly have significant health benefits.
Across much of the world, people aspire to the meat and dairy-rich diets that dominate most of high-income countries. This is seen most acutely in China, where traditional diets, rich in rice and other plant materials, are being rapidly replaced with meat dishes. The country now has more than 400m pigs – around half the global population. Changing such attitudes, and ensuring the most vulnerable people continue to obtain appropriate nutrition, is at least as big a challenge as manipulating agricultural production across the globe.
Animal production is often perceived as an unsustainable use of natural resources. Many animals are fed on food suitable for human consumption, demand a high proportion of the planet’s water resources and then produce methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases. It is hard to argue that the highest income countries should not reduce their meat and dairy.
However, other animals (including cows, sheep and goats) graze pasture that is unfit to grow human-edible crops, turning grass and other plants into high value protein. If the UK, for example, were to abandon such livestock production, are its residents really ready to see radical changes in a rural environment associated with its “green and pleasant land”? Could the uplands of Scotland, Wales and Northern England really be turned towards the production of peanuts and soya beans?
No more business as usual
The EAT-Lancet report cannot be ignored. It starkly points out the catastrophic consequences for the planet of continuing with “business as usual”. Yet it is important that, as agriculture becomes more efficient and sustainable, we still consider the health and well-being of the most vulnerable in society. This includes not only the one billion people who remain in danger of malnutrition in areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, but also many of the poorest people within the large urban conglomerates of our wealthy countries.
If adopted, the report suggests that the dietary changes recommended could save more than 11m lives each year. While most would welcome a longer and healthier life, these represent more mouths to feed in an ageing population. As people get older, their nutritional needs change and about a third of people living in care homes in the UK suffer from some degree of malnutrition. Ironically, this is often associated with a lack of high-quality protein, such as is found in meat and dairy products. This perhaps raises even more profound questions over what we wish to achieve for the future of humanity.","['hard', 'argue']"

Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.
Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season — already poisoned by last year’s Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal — is up for grabs. Certainly, the proposed plan to turn stadiums in the Phoenix, Arizona, area into the sports equivalent of a vast movie set for the games of all 30 major league teams (to be played without fans) seems far-fetched at best.
But football, now the true national pastime, is another matter.
In sports terms, as in so much else in coronaviral America, these are desperately deprived times, even for casual fans. There will be intense pressure — and not only from the president’s base — for that sport’s return. For many people, mostly men, it’s the sustaining soap opera that has always carried them into the next week and the one after that, a porn-ish escape hatch from work and family, a currency of communication with other men, an eternal connection to a non-demanding hive.
Games for Lives?
Without professional (or even college) sports right now or realistically in the near future, fans feel even more unmoored in lives that, for all of us, are distinctly adrift. As they become edgier, it’s a reasonable bet (or at least my hope) that they will also become more open to questioning Trump’s mismanagement — or, to put it more bluntly, sacrifice — of their lives. Recent polls already seem to reflect this, with the latest Gallup Poll showing the steepest approval decline of his presidency.
The president, I suspect, fears just this, though perhaps, in the end, the hole in everyday life where sports once was may only reinforce fans’ sense (like the president’s) that the games are too important not to bring back, safety be damned. Certainly, Trump and other Republican politicians have already been willing enough to forfeit lives to boost their reelection chances.
The values and sensibilities of football are, of course, Trumpist in nature. That’s why former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s demonstration against racism — performed in a kind of public isolation — elicited such a harsh reaction from the president in the now-distant pre-pandemic era. That’s why the sport’s billionaire owners, predominantly Trump donors, shunned Kaepernick (although some of their teams could have used his skills). They didn’t dare to, or care to, give him another platform, not in an era when “president” and “racism” were becoming synonymous.
Even more tellingly, in an understandable but still disappointing me-first display, few of Kaepernick’s fellow players, most of whom are also African-American, supported him publicly. After years of being celebrated as America’s “warriors” and “role models,” they came up desperately short when it counted. Compare them to healthcare workers and other front-line heroes of this pandemic and you’ll realize just how far short they fell of even the most modest form of everyday bravery.
Not that, when it comes to pro sports, football was such an outlier. As activism goes, baseball, a sport that once produced transcendent progressive heroes like Jackie Robinson, Jim Bouton, and Curt Flood, has been eerily quiet in recent years. It’s a sport that the president has paid relatively little attention to — except for suggesting recently that Pete Rose, banned from baseball for life for betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was that team’s manager, should be allowed into its Hall of Fame.
How Trumpian was that? Such betting is, of course, strictly forbidden for active players and managers who are obviously privy to inside information. But, hey, does disregarding inconvenient rules to profit from a privileged position ring any bells these days in Washington?
Trump has, in fact, been uncharacteristically silent on the recent revelation that during the 2017 season, the World Series winners, the Houston Astros, concealed a video camera in center field to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams. That’s also illegal. Major League baseball punished the team by suspending its manager and general manager for a year, imposing a $5 million fine on its owners, and taking away its first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021.
For some fans and commentators, the Astros’ punishment was too severe or too mild. Opposing players, feeling victimized by the scheme, thought specific Astros should have been penalized, too. Yet such cheating is hardly new. In 1951, the “shot heard round the world,” a famed home-run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and sent them to the World Series, was linked to the stealing of signs from the Brooklyn Dodgers through a hand-held telescope. Only the technology has improved.
A Changing National Pastime
Once baseball’s opening day passed without a pitch this April, proof that the plague was winning, the Phoenix Plan was floated. It would require all major league players and employees to be sequestered in that area and continually tested at a moment when tests might still not be universally available. But, hey, haven’t VIP Jocks always gone to the head of the line? (Actually, a massive study of 10,000 Major League Baseball employees, from players to popcorn vendors, being conducted by Stanford University and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory to find out how many contracted and may have recovered from the virus has already gotten access to such testing kits at a time when even some front-line workers can’t get them!)
For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As the country reeled from the revelation of President Bill Clinton’s sexual liaison with a White House intern and with his impeachment just around the corner, a feel-good legend was born. A white man and a brown man rose in friendly rivalry to break the 37-year-old record of 61 home runs by Roger Maris, who, in turn, had bested Babe Ruth’s famed 60 in 1927.
The good-natured competition between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (who won with 70 homers) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs (66) was, at the time, celebrated as a balm that should soothe the country. And perhaps for many fans it did indeed serve as a comforting distraction in a difficult political moment.
But that summer’s golden glow soon faded as both players were reported to have taken steroids to muscle up. McGwire would admit it years later; Sosa would not. (A dark-skinned Dominican, he further complicated his legend by bleaching his skin to whiten himself, as if in anticipation of the Trumpian racial preferences to come.) Their contemporary, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, would eventually become the single-season home run leader with 73, but has never shaken rumors that he, too, used steroids.
Nor did baseball ever fully recover its sense of primacy as the national pastime or its sense of righteousness as one of America’s first major institutions to integrate. In fact, the sport is still overwhelmingly white and skewed toward an older audience, as well as slow and outdated in an era of tweeting speed.
Which is why, whether or not baseball opens this season in a vast sports self-isolation experiment, the key to President Trump’s future lies in his perverse relationship with the National Football League. That goes back more than 30 years to the moment he tried unsuccessfully (as with so many other business ventures) to elbow his way into the sport. Give him credit, though: ever attuned to the public mood, he did sense the rise of a new national pastime.
Bet On This
One reason for the NFL’s growing popularity is the way it uses college football as its minor leagues and early showcase for pro players (though possibly not this fall). For a passionate pro football fan, it’s a pleasure to see the stars of tomorrow in the making. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. In a recent commentary in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Nathan Kalman-Lamb of Duke opines that high-revenue men’s football and basketball “will become more valuable than ever as an enticement to lure steep tuition from students.”
And here’s an innovation that the president would glory in, one that would make post-pandemic football an even greater success: the addition of real-time nationwide legal gambling on games. Just imagine the sort of Trump-donor dollars that would be stacked up to support such a future industry. After all, estimations are that illegal gambling on pro and college football is already a $93 billion business. Legal or not, it’s an integral part of the fan experience (though in the post-pandemic world there will be a lot less money in so many pockets to gamble with).
The dream of easily accessible, high-tech legal gambling has been lurking on the sidelines for years. All that’s necessary to make it come true is for Congress to reverse the 1992 Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act, the federal law that bans it in most states. And the pandemic moment may prove perfect for just that, for “reopening” football in a new and even more Trumpian way, allowing fans to sit at home and bet what money they have left on games in progress: Will that field goal attempt split the uprights? Will Tom Brady in his new Tampa Bay Buccaneers uniform make that crucial third-down conversion?
However, to reopen pro football, as the president would wish, to make life seem “normal” again, stadiums might have to remain empty (or partially empty). Imagine, for instance, if San Francisco had actually beaten Kansas City (which it didn’t) in the Super Bowl on the first Sunday in February and the expected championship parade had followed a few days later, drawing a million people to that city’s streets. It might have proved an early version of Mardi Gras (a 2020 coronaviral disaster of a get-together).
Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. From the huddle to tackling, the game is, in every way, a potential disease transmitter. The only example of social distancing (besides Kaepernick kneeling alone) I can even remember might have been the 1958 West Point football team, which fielded a “lonesome end,” Bill Carpenter. On every play, he set himself up near the far sideline in an innovative formation. He never even joined the huddle and that team went undefeated.
If it proves impossible to stage football games, given social-distancing rules, the inevitable sport of the future is already waiting in the wings. Just under the radar of most of the middle-aged and elderly, especially those without access to children, is a fiercely contested, already commodified, fan-friendly industry with championships, heroes, endorsement contracts, and a ready market for expensive gear. I’m thinking, as you may have guessed, of competitive online video games, or esports. (Think of it as the revenge of the nerds.) No matter what Donald Trump does, sooner rather than later they’re likely to replace the old up-close-and-contagious live games.
It’s not hard to imagine a future in which individual competitors, regional and national teams, leagues, or even some version of the Olympics, would be watched by millions on streaming platforms on home screens and, once social distancing becomes a historical footnote, on the screens of sports bars as well, if not theaters and arenas. While combat games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, along with sports knock-offs like Madden and NBA Live, currently dominate esports, the future will undoubtedly include brainier fare that will turn art, architecture, banking, diplomacy, music, and maybe even poetry into online competitions even Nike and Google could sponsor.
Esports already supports ESPN-style commentary. There might even be room someday for a new reality show about them hosted by a motor-mouthed, pumpkin-headed former one-term president.
Who needs football after all? It would, in fact, be the definition of madness to launch a football season in a coronaviral world. But that doesn’t mean Donald Trump won’t push for just that. The advisory board he appointed for the reopening of sports includes, as my colleague Dave Zirin points out, “a group of brigands defined by their lack of care in normal times for the safety and well-being of their employees.”
It’s Trump’s dream team because, to win in November, he needs an America in which the National Football League is back in business big time. For him it’s open arms for the NFL, which could mean open season on the rest of us.

"The Democratic candidates predictably criticized the worst Trump administration immigration policies, such as families separated at the border and chronic uncertainty for undocumented people in the U.S., many of whom arrived decades ago as children.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/how-u-s-foreign-policy-triggers-crisis-and-immigration/,alternet,immigration,left,20.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"by Brian Concannon, Independent Media Institute
The Democratic candidates missed the opportunity last week in Nevada—a state with a 30 percent Latino population—to address the root causes of our immigration crisis. They predictably criticized the worst Trump administration immigration policies, such as families separated at the border and chronic uncertainty for undocumented people in the U.S., many of whom arrived decades ago as children. How we treat people at or inside our border certainly deserves attention, but we cannot ignore that many people come to the United States in the first place because our foreign policies—by both Democrats and Republicans—force them to leave their homes in Latin America and elsewhere.
The U.S. displaces its neighbors by displacing their governments. The Obama administration supported the 2009 coup d’état against Honduras’ elected President Manuel Zelaya by U.S.-trained generals. The Obama and then the Trump administrations supported repressive and corrupt governments that followed Zelaya’s ouster, giving a green light to assassinations of dissidents and journalists, government-linked drug trafficking, and spiraling crime. This repression continues to drive tens of thousands to seek asylum in the U.S. each year, regardless of the legal obstacles we erect. More recently, the Trump administration supported last November’s military coup d’état in Bolivia—with little opposition from Democrats—deepening that country’s political crisis.
United States aid and trade policies—often touted as helping our neighbors—also drive people from their homes to our borders. NAFTA opened markets for highly efficient and highly subsidized U.S. farmers by lifting tariffs. Less subsidized Mexican farmers could not compete, and overnight lost their livelihood, forcing many to seek replacement livelihoods in the United States. In Haiti, President Bill Clinton admitted—after he left office—to a “devil’s bargain” on rice tariffs that was “good for some of my farmers in Arkansas,” but destroyed rice farming and generated hunger and malnutrition in Haiti.
The failure of the United States to tackle climate change contributes to a global migration crisis. Catastrophic disasters—growing more frequent and severe —displace more than 20 million people each year. This includes Nicaraguans and Hondurans benefitting from Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States since 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, and hundreds of thousands in Central America’s “Dry Corridor,” now facing their sixth year of drought.
The burden of harmful U.S. foreign policies falls disproportionately on women. In African countries struck by droughts, girls are taken out of school to make the longer walk for their family’s water. Repressive governments we support in Brazil, Honduras, and the Philippines keep women “in their place” with regressive laws, and by committing and permitting attacks against women advocates. Women displaced from their homes and headed to our border face a high risk of sexual assault.
Congress recently demonstrated how bipartisan cooperation can achieve more principled and constructive policies. Last spring, both houses of Congress passed a bill by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) invoking the War Powers Resolution to stop U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen that has displaced 3 million people and killed more than 100,000. President Trump vetoed the bill, but Congress’ War Powers authority, neglected for decades, is now out of the toolbox: on February 13, Senate Republicans and Democrats passed a similar measure to constrain the president’s ability to attack Iran.
The Democratic candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday states, two of which, Texas and California, have 26 million Latinos—more than the total population of any other state. Many Latino voters know from personal and family experience how U.S. policies drive people from their homes. They deserve to know, as do all of us, how candidates will address these root causes of our immigration crisis.
Candidates can start to address the root causes by pledging to respect the choices made by voters in other countries—even if we disagree with them—and ensure that our tax dollars will support economic and social development rather than war. They can announce trade policies that help farmers farm on both sides of the border, and workers everywhere earn a living wage. They can vow to reduce hurricanes, floods, and drought by putting more solar panels on our roofs and less carbon into our atmosphere. In short, the candidates can show how the United States will help our neighbors live secure, dignified lives in their own communities. Because that is a foreign policy that will ultimately benefit all of us.

"The anti-vaccination community holds to an unscientific conspiracy theory that childhood vaccinations are toxic and cause numerous illnesses and injuries, including autism, and spreads these beliefs through YouTube, Facebook and other online platforms.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/drowned-out-algorithm-pro-vaccination-advocates-struggle-be-heard-online-n976321,msnbc,vaccines,left,21.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In 2008, Vaccinate Your Family, the nation’s largest nonprofit dedicated to advocating for vaccinations, had to stop posting videos to YouTube.
Then known as Every Child By Two, the organization had used its channel on the massive video platform to post interviews with doctors, public service announcements and testimonials from parents of children who had died of vaccine-preventable diseases.
But those messages were quickly sabotaged. YouTube’s recommendation system, which appears alongside videos and suggests what users should watch next, would direct viewers to anti-vaccination videos, according to Amy Pisani, executive director of Vaccinate Your Family.
“When we would put things on YouTube, it was followed by an anti-vaccination video,” Pisani told NBC News. YouTube’s recommendation system, powered by an algorithm that the company does not make public, has been criticized in recent years for favoring controversial and conspiratorial content. The company has said that it changed the system to point to more “authoritative” sources.
“They were insane. Videos like ‘My child was harmed by the DTaP’ or ‘My child can’t walk anymore,’ every conspiracy that you can imagine would come after ours,” Pisani said. ""They actually started running right after our video was over, so if you blinked for a minute, you wouldn’t know it was a new video.”
“We became so frustrated with the recommendations that we moved them to Vimeo,” a far smaller YouTube-like video platform owned by media conglomerate InterActiveCorp, Pisani said. YouTube has more than 10 times Vimeo’s active users and is the second-largest search engine in the world after Google, which also owns YouTube.
Pisani’s story offers a window into the struggle that public health officials and advocates face as they attempt to provide information on vaccinations on social media, where anti-vaccination proponents have spent more than a decade building audiences and developing strategies that ensure they appear high in search results and automated recommendations.
The anti-vaccination community holds to an unscientific conspiracy theory that childhood vaccinations are toxic and cause numerous illnesses and injuries, including autism, and spreads these beliefs through YouTube, Facebook and other online platforms. The widespread prevalence of this misinformation on the platforms has caused some parents to withhold or delay vaccinations, leading to an increase in the spread of preventable diseases, most recently a measles outbreak in the Pacific Northwest that, as of Sunday, had infected 70 people — mostly unvaccinated children.
The World Health Organization included vaccine hesitancy in its list of top 10 threats to global health this year. Though limited, recent research suggests part of the solution to the public health crisis might be found on the same platforms that allowed vaccine myths to spread. A 2017 study published in the journal Pediatrics found that a random sampling of pregnant women who interacted with responsible vaccine information on social media were more likely to vaccinate their babies on time.
“The public understanding of science has shifted dramatically by people moving from Google search into social media to get information about vaccines or any health information,” said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center. “And this is to their detriment.”
While a valuable resource for asking questions and having discussions, social media has also opened up traps for the everyday user who may not have been susceptible to anti-vaccination theories before visiting a social media group, Donovan said.
“The opportunity has turned into a threat,” Donovan said. “Anti-vaxxers look for ‘momversation’ groups. Because they know that new parents are usually novices who haven’t thought a lot about vaccines and are very susceptible to scientific jargon because they don’t have the information literacy to sort through the rest of the internet.”
Donovan said the source of the unvetted, unscientific information surrounding vaccines isn’t just coming from oversharing parents, but often from highly motivated “snake oil salesmen,” peddling books, merchandise, and “natural cures” to vaccinate preventable illnesses.
“You have your hard-liner true believers pushing anti-vaccine information out of a real anti-scientific belief system, but then you have a whole group of other people who are monetizing it and are selling products with a marketing scheme to ‘take down big pharma,’” Donovan said.
After more than a decade and facing mounting pressure, YouTube announced a change in its recommendation algorithm this month, saying it would stop suggesting conspiracy videos like the ones that followed Vaccinate Your Family’s. YouTube also stopped some anti-vaccine videos from showing ads and earning money, and started providing more information about the threat of vaccine hesitancy in a window below anti-vaccine videos.

In a statement to NBC News, a YouTube spokesman called misinformation around medical topics “a difficult challenge,” and referred to their recent policy changes, adding, “like many algorithmic changes, these efforts will be gradual and will get more and more accurate over time.”
Pinterest has suppressed all search results on vaccines while the site figures out a solution. And Facebook — which recommends anti-vaccination groups, and allows anti-vaccination groups to target pregnant woman and mothers in paid advertising — has said it “is working” on unspecified changes in regards to health-related misinformation.
It’s all welcome progress, Pisani says, but she believes the damage has been done.
“We used to do so many helpful, wonderful things,” like helping parents who couldn’t afford vaccines and educating doctors on barriers to access, she said. “Now we spend most of our time dealing with the misinformation out there. It’s a constant battle.”
And on social media, the anti-vaccination proponents seem to be winning.
Vaccinate Your Family’s Facebook page has nearly 200,000 likes and followers, but nowhere near the visibility or engagement of anti-vaccine pages and private groups, where hundreds of thousands of users post articles from fringe health websites, trade tips on avoiding state-mandated vaccinations, and share memes bashing parents who vaccinate.
“Anti-vaccination groups are much more successful at using the interactive features of social media than places where we might typically get health advice,” said Naomi Smith, a lecturer at Federation University Australia who has studied the anti-vaccination movement on Facebook. “So pro-vaccination pages either serve as information repositories or they debunk anti-vaccination claims, neither of which get to the emotional core of anti-vaccination attitudes.”
Those attitudes are often grounded in parental concern, Smith said.
“Additionally, we have to remember that these groups usually don’t call themselves anti-vaccine, they might be ‘pro-safe vaccines’ or ‘in favor of vaccine choice,’” she said. “They appeal to parents’ protective instincts, and really tap into the genuine pain caused by childhood illness and death, which seemingly lack an adequate medical explanation.”
The National Vaccine Information Center, a misleadingly legitimate-sounding organization with 213,000 likes on Facebook, has urged parents not to vaccinate their children since the 1980s. Stop Mandatory Vaccination, one of the largest anti-vaccination pages with 127,000 likes, is run by a social media activist who crowdfunds to advertise his messages to pregnant women on Facebook.
Though Vaccinate Your Family has more Facebook followers than Stop Mandatory Vaccination, the anti-vaccine content travels much further. In the last two years, articles from Stop Mandatory Vaccination’s website were shared on Facebook more than a million times, according to the social media analysis tool BuzzSumo. Vaccinate Your Family’s content was shared just over 1,000 times.
Larry Cook, the self-described social media activist behind Stop Mandatory Vaccination, described the reason behind the disparity, telling BuzzFeed News, ""The hardcore pro-vaccine advocates do not create content, Page and Groups, that attract large followers to Facebook since that line of thinking is already the common conversation and agreement in mainstream media and the public eye.”
Pisani said they’re trying.
“The people on our page are really engaged,” Pisani said. “It’s been really impressive. Of course we get a lot of pushback. We’ll put out a post and get the same people making the same ridiculous claims.”
“Everyone has questions about vaccines,” Pisani said. “We’re polite to people who have questions. We’re not in their face and we never never argue with anti-vaxxers. We just want to get to those people before they get swooped into the nonsense.”
Some amateur vaccine advocates are more than willing to enter the fray.
Stephan Neidenbach, 38, a middle-school technology teacher from Annapolis, Maryland, runs “We Love GMOs and Vaccines,” a Facebook page he started in 2014, he said, to combat growing misinformation on Facebook.
At first Neidenbach said he was just anonymously replying to anti-vaccine content, but soon scientists, farmers and doctors started following the page and sharing.
The page — now with with 194,000 followers — is one of several on Facebook that respond directly and in-kind to anti-vaccination pages. Users share news reports about vaccine outbreaks, and post memes and screenshots of posts from anti-vaccine groups, which they ridicule in the comments.
One recent post read, “If you're antivaxx and you see me making fun of antivaxx people, I just want to say that I am talking about you personally and I hope you're offended because you're f------ stupid.”
“That’s what separates me from other organizations,” Neidenbach said. “I’m not an organization, and I’m not trying to run a nonprofit. I’m just a school teacher. And I don’t have to be as nice as I do in the classroom.”
“They have to worry about being professional,” he said. “But we can do more inflammatory stuff that the World Health organization can’t do. And the inflammatory stuff, as you can tell by the anti-vaxxers, does well on Facebook.”
“I’d love to find someone with more of a medical or scientific background to take it over, but I haven’t found anyone yet who wants to. I guess most scientists and doctors don’t have the time to do this on the side. For now, it doesn’t take much effort.”
As platforms take steps to address the spread of anti-vaccine content, Pisani is hoping that Facebook and others will promote Vaccinate Your Family’s reputable content — even if past attempts to work together have been unsuccessful.
Pisani said former first lady Rosalynn Carter, a co-founder of Vaccinate Your Family, wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2016 on behalf of the organization, after Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself with his infant daughter with the caption, “Doctor's visit — time for vaccines!”
“We wanted to work with him and his wife to talk about other ways to promote vaccines,” Pisano said. “We didn’t ask him to fix the internet, or Facebook.”

"While the major baseball leagues won’t be affected much by tariffs on Chinese imports, everyone from Double A players down through the office softball team will be.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/everything-you-need-to-play-baseball-is-made-in-china-and-getting-hit-by-trumps-tariffs/,alternet,sport,left,21.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Since 1983, Kim Karsh has helped baseball teams deal with an inconvenient fact of the modern economy: Almost everything you need to play America’s homegrown sport is now made in China, from cleats to batting helmets.
Lately, supplying the game’s amateurs and fans has gotten more difficult. Karsh owns California Pro Sports in Harbor City, California, where invoices for big customers now include a caveat: Prices are up due to the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese imports, and they could rise further on short notice.
“We have to explain to our customers that the trade war affects them as it does us,” Karsh said. “We can pass on pretty much everything to the consumer. The problem is, now they will shop lower-quality items. Some understand, and other people don’t.”
Although duties set to kick in soon will affect all manner of sports equipment that hasn’t been made in America for decades, baseball enthusiasts are perhaps affected most because so many items are needed to play the game.
Baseball caps were hit first by the third round of China tariffs that went into effect at 10% last September and rose to 25% in January, on top of the 7.5% base tariff. Those added about a dollar to the cost of a hat, Karsh said. Trump’s tariff will rise to 30% in October, bringing the total to 37.5%, and possibly causing another price increase.
Retail prices for metal bats have already risen $5 to $10 each, Karsh said, even though a 10% hike on bats and other sporting goods was put off until Dec. 15 as the Trump administration made a concession to the Christmas shopping season. On Aug. 23, President Donald Trump said he would jack up the levy to 15%.
Baseballs themselves faced tariffs starting Sept. 1, and although Karsh said prices haven’t increased yet, he’s expecting to add between $3 and $5 per dozen. “If you can buy now that would be a plus,” Karsh told customers in August, figuring the only direction the tariffs will go is up.
Since the sporting goods industry has become so dominated by Chinese imports, teams have little ability to shop around. Meanwhile, equipment is not the only mounting cost, with rising fees at municipal fields and less volunteer labor from parents. That raises the barrier to entry for a game that’s supposed to be accessible to everyone.
“Baseball is struggling. The expense of playing the game has gone up sky high,” said Charles Blackburn, executive director of the National Amateur Baseball Federation, a 105-year-old volunteer group that organizes teams and tournaments. “It’s a tax on top of a tax. They’re discouraging people from playing the game of baseball.”
The story of how baseball gear became a product of China is the tale of globalization, writ small.
In the 1800s, when baseball consisted of loosely organized leagues with few uniform standards, balls were made in a factory in Natick, Massachusetts, and sewn together by women who worked out of their homes. The manufacturer, Harwood, developed the iconic figure-eight seam design involving 108 stitches and horsehide tanned on the outskirts of town.
As baseball developed, the major leagues standardized their balls and cut exclusive sourcing deals, first with Spalding and then with St. Louis-based Rawlings. Partly owned by Major League Baseball, Rawlings is now the nation’s largest supplier of baseball gear, and also a heavy importer from China.
Even slight alterations in baseball materials and construction can lead to heated debates, fueled most recently by a rise in home runs that some have theorized may have to do with the 5-ounce spheres having less drag. But the physical ball hasn’t changed much since 1977, when Rawlings officially started producing them for both the National and American Leagues. A cork center is coated with rubber, wound with hundreds of yards of wool and cotton yarn, and finished with hand-sewn leather. Since it remains a labor-intensive process — with no machine yet able to navigate those 108 stitches — manufacturers have moved around the world in search of lower wages and higher-volume suppliers of raw materials with less toxic production processes.
“We had the facilities and the know-how,” said Bill Sells, senior vice president for government affairs at the Sports and Fitness Industry Association. “And as the market developed, others became proficient at making balls, and it went overseas.”
While the major leagues won’t be affected much by tariffs on Chinese imports, everyone from Double A players down through the office softball team will be.
Rawlings made its balls in Puerto Rico until the 1960s, when it moved to Haiti — along with other ball manufacturers, like Wilson — in search of lower labor costs. As workers in Haiti agitated for higher pay and the political situation destabilized, Rawlings then moved production to Costa Rica, where balls are still produced for the major leagues and Triple A teams.
But in 1994, Rawlings started sourcing lower-end balls for mass consumption in China. Now, America imports $69.5 million worth of baseballs and softballs from China annually, compared with $18.5 million from the next-largest supplier, Costa Rica.
Only one company still produces baseball gloves in America — Texas-based Nokona, which sells mitts for hundreds of dollars each. Wooden bats are still produced in the U.S., which is rich in lumber. But metal and composite bats are largely made in China, and those are the ones used by club and school leagues with the tightest budgets.
Although U.S.-based sporting goods companies now produce almost none of their own gear, increasing the cost of imports from China could still jeopardize thousands of U.S. white collar jobs in design, product development, and sales and marketing.
Rawlings, which declined to comment, argued against tariffs in a June letter to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. It said that if tariffs were imposed, “entire product lines” could be eliminated, and job losses within its 670-person domestic workforce would be “inevitable.”
So far, no major manufacturers have responded to Trump’s tariffs by saying they will move their supply chains out of China. Baden Sports, a family-owned sporting goods manufacturer based in Renton, Washington, tried to rush its orders to get inventory through customs before new duties take effect. After that, CEO Michael Schindler says they’ll try to distribute increased costs.
“We’re working hard with our suppliers to help alleviate the hit,” Schindler said. “The Chinese government changes the currency to account for about 2%. Then you pass a couple percent on to your customers, and you might eat a percent or two. Everybody participates in the pain. It’s in everybody’s best interest to keep the thing going.”
But Schindler acknowledged China may not be his company’s last stop. As China moves on to higher-tech products like electric cars, Schindler said, the painstaking work of ball manufacturing may migrate to nations earlier on in their industrial evolution, like Bangladesh and Malaysia — just as his company shifted from Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s to Japan and on to China. For his next move, Schindler is thinking about someplace closer to his customers, like Mexico or the Dominican Republic.
The problem is, other countries don’t have the labor force or the port capacity yet to handle a total exodus from China. Also, relationships with suppliers are hard to build: Baden has worked with the same Taiwanese-owned company since 1979, as it moved with him from country to country. It’s easier to relocate within Asia than to move halfway across the world — especially when the tariff situation seems to change from week to week.
“If you’re not thinking about it, you’re nuts,” Schindler said. “It’s almost impossible to do anything about it quickly. And partially because when the tariffs were first talked about, you never really knew. It’s really hard to make hard and fast decisions when you really don’t know.”
Uncertainty also faces most baseball teams and leagues as they plan next season’s purchases.
The Fort Wayne TinCaps, a Class A team, has braced for a cost increase. The team bought 8,160 balls last year at $53 a dozen, which comes to $36,040. Rawlings has an exclusive contract to supply the TinCaps with Chinese-made baseballs, so there’s no way to bargain down the price. Although the TinCaps share the cost of bats and balls with their major league affiliate, the San Diego Padres, collectively the tariffs could mean a significant cost increase by next year.
And that could also affect the fan experience, from Double A teams on down, said team President Michael Nutter. One of the traditions of these games is tossing balls out to eager fans, which can get expensive if prices rise.
“I know some teams and operators are really strict with the baseballs and discourage players from throwing them to fans and trying to protect every single baseball,” Nutter said, while noting that he’ll continue to encourage fielders to be generous. “Really, to us, this is a cost of doing business.”
Youth sports have even less wiggle room. Tariffs have been on the minds of school baseball team managers across the country, many of whom operate on fixed budgets from local governments, dues paid by parents and ticket sales.
“Anytime there’s an increase in equipment cost, it gets passed on to the gate, or you have another fundraiser,” said Shelton Crews, executive director of the Florida Athletic Coaches Association. “I know up here in Tallahassee, parents have to raise so much money or make up the difference in cash.”
At a certain point, increased prices will translate into lower sales, especially for the mom-and-pop shops like Karsh’s that already operate on razor-thin margins.
“We can survive, but it’s very unfortunate what they’re doing,” Karsh said. “The manufacturers have put all their eggs in one basket. But there’s not much I can do about it. Not much anybody can do about it.”","['affected', 'be']"

An ongoing joint investigation between The Associated Press and the PBS series Frontline on the treatment of migrant children under U.S. watch has found his administration jailed an unprecedented 69,550 kids in the past year. “That’s more children detained away from their parents than any other country, according to United Nations researchers.”
This includes children that officials have stolen from their families, done so with full knowledge that family separation and detention cause long-term harm to children, and done so with the fact that for the first time in years, migrant kids have died under U.S. watch. “Early experiences are literally built into our brains and bodies,” said Dr. Jack Shonkoff of Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child, and few experiences can be more traumatic for a child than armed agents ripping them out of a guardian’s arms.
In just one example cited in the investigation, U.S. officials took a three-year-old Honduran toddler from her dad last March—keep in mind the administration has supposedly been blocked from separating families under a June 2018 court order—and put her into a foster home where another child molested her. “As the days passed, she began urinating on herself and seemed unable to eat or drink, a foster parent said in the records,” the investigation said.
For three weeks, the dad didn’t know where his three-year-old was, kept totally in the dark by officials. When he finally did get to talk to her on the phone, she was hysterical, and accused him of abandoning her. “I don’t love you Daddy, you left me alone,” he said the sobbing child told her.
A separate tally from last month found the U.S. has kidnapped nearly 5,500 children from their families at the border since 2017. By comparison, “in Canada, immigrant children are separated from their parents only as a last resort; 155 were detained in 2018. In the United Kingdom, 42 migrant children were put in shelters in 2017, according to officials in those countries.”",['stolen']
Some of the liberal opposition is often grounded in the mistaken belief that Warren’s plan would do more to reduce the racial wealth gap than Warren’s. The opposite is true: full cancellation would reduce the racial wealth gap more than Warren’s plan would. ,https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/bernies-student-debt-plan-creates-a-million-more-jobs-than-warrens-heres-why-she-should-embrace-it/,alternet,student-debt,left,21.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both offered proposals to cancel student debt, a nearly $1.6 trillion burden on borrowers and a major drag on the economy. While both are aggressive attempts to address the student debt crisis, there is a major difference between the two plans: the Sanders plan is likely to create at least one million more jobs than Warren’s, since it cancels roughly $1 trillion more in outstanding debt.
The figure of one million additional jobs was derived from the conclusions of a 2018 report from the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, which used widely accepted macroeconomic models (the Fair and Moody’s models) to project the macroeconomic effect of canceling all student debt. The Levy report used a start date in 2017 for its projections.
As the graph below shows, the models used in the Levy report show that several million jobs are created by the cancellation of all student debt (the exact amount varies, depending on the economic model used):
Source: “The Macroeconomic Effects of Student Debt Cancellation,” Kelton et al., Levy Economics Institute, 2018
Averaging these figures, the report shows that approximately 4.4 million jobs would be created by full cancellation in the first five years. Using these figures, it’s possible to approximate the differing effects of the Warren and Sanders plan with the following steps:
First, reducing the Levy report’s numbers by 60 percent gives us something in the neighborhood of 2.6 million fewer jobs under Warren’s plan. Given that the debt is now larger than it was in the Levy study, that number could be bumped by 10 or 15 percent.
That calculation is, however, too crude. It’s fair to assume that the stimulus effect of cancellation is greater on the lower end of the income spectrum, where urgent needs are going unmet, and would be somewhat smaller for the relatively well-off (although not wealthy) households included in the Sanders plan. The multiplier effect of government stimulus measures is also likely to be smaller in the current economy. To ensure that these factors are considered, I have cut the job difference by nearly half to arrive at the figure of one million more jobs created with full cancellation.
The idea that student debt cancellation creates jobs is intuitive, as well. If 44 million student debt holders are relieved of their debt burden, they will have more money to spend each month for food, entertainment, and other purchases. Studies have shown that student debt is also keeping younger people from forming households (which, ironically, means a lower benefit under the Warren plan if they’re living with their parents). Household formation, which is the result of longer-term thinking about affordability, in turn means the purchase of home items, cars, and houses.
With those factors in mind, I asked the lead author of the Levy report whether it would be safe to say that the Sanders plan would create a million more jobs than the Warren plan. Professor Stephanie Kelton, of Stony Brook University, replied that a full study would be required to answer the question with confidence. But Kelton said the one-million-jobs figure “looks reasonable.” (Kelton, an adviser to Sen. Sanders, is also a macroeconomist and professor. She is not employed by the campaign.)
Why It Matters
Both proposals would create jobs for working people, and the additional one million from Sanders’ plan would be useful. Despite today’s “excellent” job numbers, the working economy isn’t as good as the headlines would have us believe. The number of open jobs (7.2 million) is essentially unchanged from last year’s, and is declining slightly. That means there is relatively little pressure to pay workers more. Wage growth remains weak. It’s not a great time to be a working person in this country.
The biggest losers in this job economy are millennials, the same group that bears the heaviest burden of student debt. (Student debt affects all adult age groups, including seniors, but falls heaviest on younger adults.) Millennials have become the largest generation in the American workforce, and are still suffering the economic consequences of entering the workforce during the Great Recession.
At $1.6 trillion, full student debt cancellation rivals Trump’s tax cut in its scope. It would, however, be far more effective at creating jobs and stimulating the economy. Because the benefits of Trump’s cut were directed toward higher earners, who have much less pressure to spend, the Trump cut left the trajectory of job growth essentially unchanged.
Muddled Debate
That distinction has been obscured in what has been, at least so far, a muddled debate.
Headlines like Vice’s “Elizabeth Warren Is Taking Her Plan to Cancel 75% of Student Debt to Congress” have added to public confusion over the two candidates’ plans. Warren’s $640 billion proposal would, in fact, cancel only 40 percent of all outstanding student debt. The confusion has also been compounded, no doubt unintentionally, by Sen. Warren’s remark during her second presidential debate that her plan would “cancel student debt for 95 percent of the people who have it.”
That statement, while true, could leave some listeners with the wrong impression. Warren’s plan would cancel at least some student debt for 95 percent of debt holders, and all debt for 75 percent of borrowers (the source of Vice’s erroneous headline). But some borrowers owe more than others, which is why the Warren plan leaves roughly $1 trillion in student debt in place. Twenty-five percent of borrowers, more than 10 million people, would still have student debt under Warren’s plan.
Warren’s plan, unlike Sanders’, caps the amount to be canceled at $50,000 per person. That figure is progressively reduced for income above $100,000 per year per household until it reaches $250,000, at which point no cancellation is offered. But households making $100,000 year aren’t necessarily prosperous. While they are not impoverished, a working couple—say, a bus driver and schoolteacher making $51,000 each—aren’t especially well-off by most standards, especially if they’re raising children. If one or more children with student debt lives and works at home, their added income would further reduce the debt relief to a family that may well be struggling.
The desire to limit debt reductions for these households may have some tactical vote-seeking value, especially in a political culture that has directed intra-middle-class resentment toward better-off workers rather than the wealthy. That doesn’t make it the best policy for working people of any age, race, or income level. In fact, because of its limits, Warren’s plan would have a significantly smaller stimulus effect and would therefore help all workers somewhat less.
The Roots of Opposition
The point needs to be reiterated: Full student debt cancellation, of the kind Sanders is proposing, would create at least a million more jobs than the Warren plan. Why, then, would progressives oppose it?
Some of the liberal opposition is often grounded in the mistaken belief that Warren’s plan would do more to reduce the racial wealth gap than Warren’s. The opposite is true: full cancellation would reduce the racial wealth gap more than Warren’s plan would. As economist Marshall Steinbaum, a co-author of the Levy report, later concluded: “The more debt cancellation there is, the more racial wealth inequality is reduced—at least among the plans that have actually been proposed.”
There is also a deep attachment to targeted economic programs in certain liberal circles, based on the sense that government programs should be focused solely on individuals in dire need. (I wrote an essay in The American Prospect on that topic.) For student debt cancellation, this is often framed as a desire to avoid helping the “wealthy.” But truly wealthy individuals are unlikely to hold student debt. If they have family wealth, there would have been no need to borrow for college. If they have subsequently become wealthy, their advisers have almost certainly told them to pay off student debt, which normally charges high interest rates.
It’s true that there are some mildly prosperous professionals who hold a large amount of student debt. But it takes a strange moral logic to deny jobs for a million working people out of fear that, say, a well-to-do orthodontist on Long Island might get a break she doesn’t deserve. There is no such liberal compunction about infrastructure programs, for example, even though they could make a few construction executives wealthy as they create jobs for working people.
The million-plus additional jobs created by full cancellation would go to a broad array of working people in a range of fields, in industries that range from restaurants to sales, and from auto manufacturing to construction. A large percentage of them would go to people of color, which would further reduce the racial wealth gap at a time when the African American unemployment rate remains roughly double that of whites.
Summary
To sum up:
Full cancellation creates at least a million more jobs than Warren’s partial cancellation.
Full cancellation does more to reduce the racial wealth gap than Warren’s plan does.
Full cancellation will almost certainly do much more to benefit millennials, the generation that’s been hardest hit by student debt and is the largest percentage of the workforce.
Full cancellation will almost certainly do much more to help black workers, who are experiencing twice the unemployment of white workers.
There are other benefits to full cancellation, too. It’s easier to explain to voters. Its million-job advantage makes it easier to build support among people who have never gone to college or acquired student debt, groups that might otherwise resent student debt cancellation. It would stimulate more economic growth, with greater advantages for the entire economy (including investors). And it wouldn’t be subject to gaming, the way Warren’s plan would be. (Children would claim to live elsewhere, people would move taxable income from year to year, couples would defer marriage, etc.)
Elizabeth Warren has many impressive policy proposals, and is very possibly unaware of the differing impact of her means-tested student debt plan on working people. There is every reason to hope she will reconsider after reviewing the advantages of a broader proposal, and join with Sen. Sanders in supporting full student debt cancellation.

Hotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/anti-vaxxers-are-latching-onto-the-coronavirus-pandemic-to-bolster-their-movement/,alternet,vaccines,left,21.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While most of the world hungers for a vaccine to put an end to the death and economic destruction wrought by COVID-19, some anti-vaccine groups are joining with anti-lockdown protesters to challenge restrictions aimed at protecting public health.
Vaccine critics suffered serious setbacks in the past year, as states strengthened immunization laws in response to measles outbreaks sparked by vaccine refusers. California tightened its vaccine requirements last fall despite protests during which anti-vaccine activists threw blood on state senators, assaulted the vaccine bill’s sponsor and shut down the legislature.
Now, many of these same vaccine critics are joining a fight against stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which had killed more than 47,000 Americans as of Thursday afternoon.
“This is just a fresh coat of paint for the anti-vaccine movement in America, and an exploitative means for them to try to remain relevant,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
Hotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.
“Unfortunately, their strategy may work.”
A group calling itself the Freedom Angels, whose members last year stood on chairs and chanted at public hearings on the California vaccine bill, say governors are abusing their power by shutting down gun shops and other businesses.
Many anti-vaccine activists — who have claimed that diseases such as measles aren’t that serious — now contend the coronavirus isn’t dangerous enough to justify staying home. They agree with President Donald Trump that the “cure” for the pandemic could be worse than the disease itself.
That’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.”
“This is the time for people to take notice and really evaluate the freedoms they’re giving up, all in the name of perceived safety,” said Freedom Angels co-founder Heidi Munoz Gleisner in a Facebook video.
The group organized a Monday rally in Sacramento called “Operation Gridlock.”
“People need to get back to work, get back to life, get back into contact with their loved ones who they’re isolated from, they need to be able to have a paycheck,” group co-founder Tara Thornton told The Sacramento Bee, which interviewed her during the demonstration. “This is the grounds they will enslave us upon.”
Freedom Angels did not respond to requests for interviews. The group’s website mentions plans for additional rallies and includes photos from Monday’s demonstration, such as one in which a protester holds a sign proclaiming “No Mandatory Vaccines.”
But after the Monday event, the California Highway Patrol announced it had revoked the group’s permit for future protests because the gathering — which included dozens of people — violated the governor’s social distancing order. The highway patrol has now banned all group events at the Capitol during the pandemic to avoid spreading the coronavirus.
A big tent
The anti-vaccine movement has never been limited to one political party. Left-leaning vaccine critics — such as Children’s Health Defense, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — include environmentalists who are suspicious of chemical pollutants, corporations and “Big Pharma.” The Kennedy group’s website attacks Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for rushing “risky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines” into development as part of a “sweetheart deal” for drug companies.
On the other side of the political spectrum, many anti-vaccine conservatives oppose state immunization requirements because they distrust “big government.”
A group called Texans for Vaccine Choice has called on the governor to promise that no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine in order to go to work or school.
Posts on the Facebook page of Californians for Health Choice, which also opposed California’s vaccine laws, question stay-at-home orders and accuse government officials of refusing to admit the orders are a mistake.
In a video on the Freedom Angels’ Facebook page, its founders describe stay-at-home orders as an abuse of government authority, and the closure of California gun shops as an assault on the Second Amendment. The group notes that guns could be essential for protection from rioters and looters looking to steal food during the pandemic.
In many ways, the conservative arm of the anti-vaccine movement is a natural ally for those leading “reopen America” rallies, said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the Science-Based Medicine site. Both harbor suspicions about government authority.
Vaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. Trump has at times linked vaccines with autism, although he came out strongly in favor of vaccinations during the 2019 measles epidemic.
Anti-vaccine groups are now rebranding themselves as advocates of “medical freedom.”
Protests against social distancing began in Michigan but have spread to state capitols in Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere, with more planned. Most protests have been small, limited to a few hundred or fewer people.
Yet the anti-vaccine movement doesn’t speak for everyone on the right.
Stephen Moore, the senior economic contributor for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group that has been helping publicize the protests, said he’s unfamiliar with the Freedom Angels or their rallies.
“I’m personally pro-vaccine,” said Moore, a member of the White House council to reopen the economy. “Especially when it comes to coronavirus.”
And some heroes of the anti-vaccine movement say they support coronavirus lockdowns.
Dr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica, California, pediatrician popular among vaccine foes for downplaying the risks of measles, said the risk of COVID-19 is real. Gordon said he approves of the lockdown, “and we have to keep it up.”
Containing the pandemic
Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and California state senator who has championed stronger vaccine mandates, described anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters as “essentially selfish” because they put other people at risk.
“One of the hallmarks of the anti-vaccine movement is this sense of selfishness and lack of concern for other people’s health,” Pan said. “They like to talk about rights and freedom. But what they really want is freedom without consequences.”
Both anti-vaccine parents and those who want to relax social distancing assume that the medical system will come to their rescue if they become sick, said Pan, who noted that thousands of health care workers have died while fighting the pandemic.
Fauci has said that relaxing stay-at-home orders is dangerous as long as the virus — for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines — is actively spreading. Reopening businesses too soon could spark a second wave of infections.
More than 75 companies and research groups worldwide are trying to develop vaccines, which are seen as a key weapon against the novel coronavirus.
In the meantime, the CDC says that social distancing measures — such as working from home and avoiding large gatherings — are critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing patients from overwhelming hospitals. Health leaders say it won’t be safe to reopen the county until widespread testing shows the coronavirus has died down.
Americans overwhelmingly support vaccination, according to surveys, and polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 80% of Americans want lockdowns to continue. Only 19% said social distancing orders placed an unnecessary burden on the economy. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
Neither the anti-vaccine nor anti-lockdown demonstrators represent the opinions of most Americans, Pan said.
“Let’s put this movement into proper context,” he said. “They’re loud, they’re noisy and they’re small.”","['stoked', 'anti-government']"
"If task force candidates from these organizations were absolute non-starters for presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, because they want to treat people who have committed crimes with too much human dignity, Sanders could instead have turned to an array of “progressive prosecutors.”",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/there-are-troubling-signs-in-the-joint-bernie-biden-criminal-justice-task-force/,alternet,elections-2020,left,21.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In an attempt to unite the centrist and progressive wings of the Democratic Party, presumptive 2020 presidential nominee Joe Biden and runner-up Bernie Sanders put together six “unity task forces” to shape policies, with the following respective areas of focus: climate change, education, the economy, healthcare, immigration and criminal justice reform. For each task force, reports Vox, Biden got five picks and Sanders three.
This is a positive for the party’s electoral prospects, after a bitterly fragmented primary. Unfortunately, the people selected for the task forces demonstrate how not only the party establishment, but even an insurgent progressive like Sanders, privilege certain topics over others. The criminal justice reform task force is incredibly milquetoast.
While status quo-shattering progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) are included on the climate change and healthcare committees, respectively, not a single person in the criminal justice reform group brings comparable strength of ideas or clout.
Biden’s five picks are typical of centrists who want to trim the edges of our bloated, draconian justice system without changing anything systemically.
Two are top members of the Obama Department of Justice (DOJ): former Attorney General Eric Holder and former acting assistant attorney general Vanita Gupta. While these figures supported deprioritizing federal enforcement of anti-marijuana laws and expressed some dismay toward the harshest mandatory minimum prison sentences for drugs, they did little to address federal prosecutors’ complete lack of accountability—due to secrecy and their near-unlimited discretion, which they often use to push for very harsh sentences to match the non-mandatory US Sentencing Guidelines.
Biden also chose Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA), who has a fairly decent track record on opposing mandatory minimums. But Rep. Scott is still a far cry from a fellow Congressional moderate who was not selected: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who has proposed the return of federal parole and other sweeping changes. To round out his side of the table, Biden chose Raumesh Akbari, a state senator from Tennessee who has accomplished virtually nothing to decarcerate at home, and Symone Sanders, a political aide who defended Biden’s pro-mass incarceration past and has narrow professional experience in this area.
Reformers expected Biden to be weak on decarceration, considering he promulgated the noxious 1994 Crime Bill, among other stains on his record, and has shown little interest in mass incarceration outside of maintaining it.
But Sanders’ picks are where things get devastatingly disappointing.
It’s 2020, not 1990. Even setting aside the many non-law enforcement options for a moment, Sanders had dozens of relatively progressive elected prosecutors to choose from if he wished to balance credibility with moderates with the need for real change. Sanders is familiar with at least several of them, having personally endorsed them.
Yet instead, he appointed three ineffective, unambitious choices: Chiraag Bains of Demos, a small center-left think tank; South Carolina State Representative Justin Bamberg; and Linn County, Iowa Supervisor Stacey Walker.
First things first, Sanders was good to his people—Bamberg was an endorser in 2016 (though he originally backed Hillary Clinton), and Walker worked his Iowa campaign.
Bamberg does have the noteworthy experience of being a civil litigator who has sued on behalf of many of the most high-profile victims of police brutality and killings. Yet that translates only to a limited degree into forming a policy agenda that ends mass incarceration. Thanks to the power of police unions and police willingness to punish any politician who stands in the way of impunity for violence, police are also the hardest part of the criminal justice system to reform.
In terms of bills proposed, Bamberg wants substantial reforms that would make people on parole eligible for lower-level felonies after serving a third of a prison sentence of 30 years or less, or 10 years of a life sentence.
However, many common nonviolent drug felonies are so-called “unclassified” felonies under South Carolina law, placing them into the current “no parole” offense category. Bamberg’s bill gives credence to this bogus idea, noting that people serving time on current “no parole” felonies—like most meth charges, or an 18-year-old sharing heroin with a 17-year-old—would have to serve fully 65 percent of their sentence in prison, and face intensive supervision until the 85 percent threshold is hit. Knowing that his parole reform bill would not pass through a Republican-dominated legislature in the Deep South anyway, Bamberg might still have addressed this as a symbolic gesture.
Meanwhile, Iowa’s Stacey Walker has no substantive criminal justice experience on his resume. Some of his career is certainly admirable, such as his work to help at-risk kids graduate high school. But it seems his most noteworthy criminal justice accomplishment was putting implicit bias training for county prosecutors on the agenda, much to his county attorney’s laughable chagrin.
Unfortunately, implicit bias training doesn’t even work. The Urban Institute conducted an audit of DOJ’s National Initiative for Building Community Trust—a multi-million dollar program including implicit bias training in police departments as a primary objective. Nancy La Vigne, the Urban Institute’s vice president for justice policy, recently “liked” a tweet stating that her organization deemed the project “essentially worthless.”
Finally, there is Chiraag Bains, who has a managerial role at Demos as the director of Legal Strategies. But Demos is not even a criminal justice reform-specific organization. According to Bains’ biography page, only a fraction of his docket is on-topic—and even then it deals with the fringes of ending mass incarceration, such as protecting “voting rights of pretrial detainees and others unlawfully disenfranchised through the criminal justice system.” While admirable, this is probably not what most voters think of when they hear “criminal justice reform”—they think of ending mass incarceration.
To that point, Bains was also an Obama DOJ prosecutor, albeit with a caseload addressing the kinds of people liberals want to lock up, such as hate crimes, arson against reproductive health clinics, and the like.
Sanders could and should have gotten some real innovators in there. There is a large network of progressive criminal justice reform professionals with both a strong grasp on policy and the belief that mass incarceration is an atrocity.
For example, there is the Justice Collaborative, which, despite assisting the occasional awful prosecutor, employs dozens of sharp decarceration-focused lawyers with a tremendous amount of criminal litigation experience. Many of them are former public defenders who are also women of color. Justice Collaborative’s sister organization, The Appeal, has hosted Bernie Sanders himself on its webinars. And then there are plenty of more mainstream but creditable criminal justice reform organizations, like the Vera Institute for Justice, REFORM Alliance, #Cut50 and more.
If task force candidates from these organizations were absolute non-starters for presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, because they want to treat people who have committed crimes with too much human dignity, Sanders could instead have turned to an array of “progressive prosecutors.”
Top reform prosecutors like Larry Krasner (Philadelphia), Aramis Ayala (Orlando) and Rachael Rollins (Boston) would have almost certainly picked up the phone as a major political boost. Harris County (Houston), Texas District Attorney Kim Ogg is not that progressive at all—Sanders endorsed her socialist challenger Audia Jones this year—but still probably has more expertise and reformist accomplishments than some who made the cut.
Criminal justice reform always gets the short end of the political stick from national politicians, even those like Sanders. And people—especially people of color who have loved ones locked up for way too long on nonviolent crimes—are sick of it.
Filter asked Anrica Caldwell, whose fiancé David Barren received a sentence reduction from life-without-parole to 30 years in prison—for a nonviolent drug-law violation—for her view.
“People like me always vote with our conscience, on party lines, but when it comes to criminal justice reform, no one steps up to the plate,” she said.
“Some Republicans have delivered more when it comes to cutting the prison population,” Caldwell continued. “It is ironic for Democrats to speak about justice when we are simply suffocating from a lack of criminal justice reform.

"The Trump administration gave the Border Patrol unchallengeable authority over migrants seeking asylum by invoking a little-known power given to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. public health agency, to ban the entry of people or things that might spread “infectious disease” in the U.S.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/leaked-memo-reveals-the-trump-administration-told-border-patrol-agents-to-ignore-asylum-law/,alternet,immigration,left,22.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

For the first time since the enactment of the Refugee Act in 1980, people who come to the U.S. saying they fear persecution in their home countries are being turned away by Border Patrol agents with no chance to make a legal case for asylum.
The shift, confirmed in internal Border Patrol guidance obtained by ProPublica, is the upshot of the Trump administration’s hasty emergency action to largely shut down the U.S.-Mexico border over coronavirus fears. It’s the biggest step the administration has taken to limit humanitarian protection for people entering the U.S. without papers.
The Trump administration has created numerous obstacles over recent years for migrants to claim asylum and stay in the United States. But it had not — until now — allowed Border Patrol agents to simply expel migrants with no process whatsoever for hearing their claims.
The administration gave the Border Patrol unchallengeable authority over migrants seeking asylum by invoking a little-known power given to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. public health agency, to ban the entry of people or things that might spread “infectious disease” in the U.S. The CDC on March 20 barred entry of people without proper documentation, on the logic that they could be unexamined carriers of the disease and out of concern about the effects if the novel coronavirus swept through Customs and Border Protection holding facilities.
U.S. immigration law requires the government to allow people expressing a “well-founded” fear of persecution or torture to be allowed to pursue legal status in the United States. The law also requires the government to grant status to anyone who shows they likely face persecution if returned to their homeland.
“The Trump administration’s new rule and CDC order do not trump U.S. laws passed by Congress and U.S. legal obligations under refugee and human rights treaties,” Eleanor Acer, of the legal advocacy group Human Rights First, told ProPublica. “But the Trump administration is wielding them as the ultimate tool to shut the border to people seeking refuge.”
Two weeks ago, the Trump administration hastily put in place a policy, which the internal guidance calls Operation Capio, to push the overwhelming majority of unauthorized migrants into Mexico within hours of their apprehension in the U.S.
The Trump administration has been publicly vague on what happens under the new policy to migrants expressing a fear of persecution or torture, the grounds for asylum. But the guidance provided to Border Patrol agents makes clear that asylum-seekers are being turned away unless they can persuade both a Border Patrol agent — as well as a higher-ranking Border Patrol official — that they will be tortured if sent home. There is no exception for those who seek protection on the basis of their identities, such as race or religion.
Over 7,000 people have been expelled to Mexico under the order, according to sources briefed by Customs and Border Protection officials.
The guidance, shared with ProPublica by a source within the Border Patrol, instructs agents that any migrant caught entering without documentation must be processed for “expulsion,” citing the CDC order. When possible, migrants are to be driven to the nearest official border crossing and “expelled” into Mexico or Canada. (The Mexican government has agreed to allow the U.S. to push back not only Mexican migrants, but also those from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador; the four countries account for about 85% of all unauthorized border crossings.)
Under the Refugee Convention, which the U.S. signed onto in 1968, countries are barred from sending someone back to a country in which they could be persecuted based on their identity (specifically, their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a “particular social group”).
The Trump administration has taken several steps to restrict the ability of migrants to seek asylum, a form of legal status that allows someone to eventually become a permanent U.S. resident. Until now, however, it has acknowledged that U.S. and international law prevents the U.S. from sending people back to a place where they will be harmed. And it has still allowed people who claim a fear of persecution to seek a less permanent form of legal status in the U.S. (In the last two weeks of February, 2,915 people were screened for humanitarian protection, according to the most recent statistics provided by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.)
The Border Patrol guidance provided to ProPublica shows that the U.S. is acting as if that obligation no longer applies.
Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, said it would not comment on the document provided to ProPublica. Asked whether any guidance had been provided regarding people who expressed a fear of persecution of torture, an agency spokesperson said in a statement, “The order does not apply where a CBP officer determines, based on consideration of significant law enforcement, officer and public safety, humanitarian, or public health interests, that the order should not be applied to a particular person.”
That language does not appear in the guidance ProPublica received. Instead, it specifies that any exception must be approved by the chief patrol agent of a given Border Patrol sector. One former senior CBP official, who reviewed the guidance at ProPublica’s request, said that because there are so many levels of hierarchy between a chief patrol agent and a line agent, agents would be unlikely to ask for an exemption to be made.
The guidance offers some details of exceptions that Border Patrol should make on public-safety grounds — people with felony convictions, for example, are to be held in detention rather than being sent back — but none on health grounds.
In fact, the guidance provides no instructions on medical screening or care for migrants, making it impossible to know how such an exception would be made. (One source briefed by CBP on the policy said the agency said migrants would not be expelled if they showed symptoms of illness or claimed a medical issue, but there is no mention of this in the guidance ProPublica received.)
The guidance makes a single humanitarian exception: If a migrant, before expulsion, tells the Border Patrol agent that they fear torture in their home country, they can be kept in the U.S. and referred to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which evaluates claims for humanitarian protection, to see if they qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture. But agents are not instructed to ask; the migrant has to volunteer the information “spontaneously.” Then, the Border Patrol agent is instructed to analyze whether the claim is “reasonably believable” — something they haven’t been trained to do.
As recently as last fall, the Trump administration acknowledged in court filings that it’s bound both to protect victims of torture under the Convention Against Torture and to protect victims of persecution under the Refugee Convention.
Even as it has erected bars to asylum — most notably, preventing anyone who crosses through Mexico from receiving asylum in the U.S. — it has continued to allow anyone entering the U.S. to seek a lesser form of legal status called “withholding of removal,” which allows an immigrant to stay in the U.S. but does not allow them to become a permanent resident. (Since the passage of the 1980 Refugee Act, federal law requires the executive branch to grant this status to anyone who can show it’s more likely than not they’ll be persecuted.)
The Operation Capio guidance does not mention the possibility that someone could be eligible for lesser protections instead of expulsion. Two sources briefed on the new policy confirmed that neither asylum nor withholding of removal is available to anyone subject to the CDC order.
In that briefing, CBP officials claimed that a migrant expressing any sort of fear is referred for screening to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, but that migrants will only pass that screening if they claim torture. However, the guidance doesn’t instruct Border Patrol agents to refer other types of claims to USCIS (and instructs them only to refer torture claims when they are “reasonably believable”).
In lawsuits challenging the administration’s asylum policies, Department of Justice lawyers have described withholding of removal as a “mandatory” form of protection — something it’s required to provide — while asylum is “discretionary.” In a brief filed last fall with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the government wrote that “The United States has implemented its non-refoulement obligations” — the obligation not to send people back to danger — “by providing withholding of removal and CAT (Convention Against Torture) protection.”
Now, the U.S. is only providing one of the two — and only at the discretion of Border Patrol.
“If you read between the lines,” one congressional staff member briefed on the operation told ProPublica, “they’re saying that Title 42 (the chapter of the U.S. Code that includes the CDC’s quarantine power) supersedes Title 8 (which covers immigration law).” Title 42 doesn’t clearly state that the administration may suspend its obligations under immigration law, and the Trump administration hasn’t published any legal opinions or memos that make its case.
No legal challenges have yet been filed against the new policy. Lawyers told ProPublica that the secrecy of the policy has made it harder to compile a case against it.
The administration has argued that the risk of coronavirus spreading through Customs and Border Protection holding facilities — which aren’t equipped to deal with medical needs — justifies the mass-expulsion policy. Since putting the policy in place, the number of people crossing into the U.S. has dropped drastically, according to official CBP statistics circulated internally and provided to ProPublica, and there are only 330 people in CBP custody at last count, down from over 1,300 as of March 25.
The new guidance instructs agents to wear personal protective equipment at all times and not to use any Border Patrol vehicle to transport migrants that isn’t specifically designated for Operation Capio.
However, because the Operation Capio process doesn’t include medical screening, it will be impossible to know whether any migrants who are being expelled just in case they have the novel coronavirus are actually infected.","['unchallengeable', 'authority']"
"The false messages that they say convinced hundreds of New Yorkers not to vaccinate their children weren’t spread in a Facebook group or on YouTube, but through a glossy magazine written by and for Orthodox Jewish parents.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brooklyn-measles-outbreak-how-glossy-booklet-spread-anti-vaccine-messages-n993596,msnbc,vaccines,left,22.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As New York officials declared a public health emergency in parts of Brooklyn this week, establishing mandatory vaccinations in an effort to stop the city’s worst measles outbreak in almost 30 years, health advocates pointed to what they believe is a major source of vaccine misinformation in the affected neighborhoods.
The false messages that they say convinced hundreds of New Yorkers not to vaccinate their children weren’t spread in a Facebook group or on YouTube, but through a glossy magazine written by and for Orthodox Jewish parents. Copies of the magazine were shared in a way that seems old-fashioned in the age of misinformation — through family, friends and neighbors.
“The Vaccine Safety Handbook” looks legitimate but is filled with wild conspiracy theories and inaccurate data. Published by an anonymously led group called Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health, or PEACH, the handbook disputes the well-established dangers of illnesses like measles and polio, challenges the effectiveness of vaccines in eradicating those illnesses, and likens the U.S. government's promotion of vaccines to the medical atrocities of Nazi Germany.
Inside its 40 pages, between cartoons mocking the medical establishment, PEACH’s magazine inaccurately suggests vaccines are made up of “toxins.” Without evidence, it claims that vaccines are the nation’s greatest threat to public health, linked to autism, ADHD, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, miscarriage and other maladies.
A note from the handbook’s editor in chief explains why Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health is an anonymous organization: “Please forgive us for our anonymity. It is not because we don’t believe in our cause. We do! It is because many of us have suffered abuse from fellow community members for questioning the medical authorities and advocating for children’s health.”
Yet according to New York State's Department of State and internet domain registration records, PEACH appears to be linked both to a decade-old misinformation hotline targeting the Orthodox community and to Enriched Parenting, a website that peddles new-age cures from a Jewish perspective alongside vaccine hoaxes.
Enriched Parenting’s website features retouched photos of children picking flowers in fields of lavender alongside articles that explain how concern over the measles outbreak is overblown. There are articles about how to beat back-to-school blues and treat urinary tract infections with herbs. There is also a forum where members trade sourdough recipes and alternative cancer treatments.
It’s not just trendy, it’s effective. Research shows combining vaccine misinformation with alternative medicine, homeopathy and diet content this way is one of the most pervasive and persuasive techniques used by anti-vaccination advocates to forward their agenda.
“When a piece of misinformation is linked to other beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors that one already accepts, that misinformation becomes easier to understand and accept,” said Meghan Bridgid Moran, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And anti-vaccine websites can leverage this by associating misinformation about vaccines with alternative medicine or holistic healthcare.”
In 2017, members of Pittsburgh’s Orthodox Jewish community — which has largely embraced vaccinations — complained on Facebook that PEACH was targeting their neighborhoods by mailing out unsolicited copies of the handbook.
Since the start of the New York measles outbreak in October, 285 cases have been confirmed in the city, most of them unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children, resulting in 21 hospitalizations and five admissions to the intensive care unit. This outbreak, like others last year in New York and New Jersey, spread within Orthodox Jewish communities.

Blima Marcus, a nurse practitioner at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a member of the Orthodox Jewish Nurses Association, told the New York blog Gothamist that the magazine “was a piece of anti-vaccination propaganda” that was particularly effective in the Orthodox community in part due to “an almost genetic fear of whether what the government says is true.”
Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the city’s health commissioner, said Tuesday that the outbreak “is being fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods. They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science.”
For a decade, through the Akeres Habayis Hotline, a recorded-message center for Orthodox Jewish women, PEACH has been spreading unfounded fears about vaccines in the Orthodox community and helping skeptical parents avoid them. Chany Silber, 41, has been moderating the conference calls since at least 2011, according to advertisements in Jewish magazines. In 2014, according to internet registration records, Silber bought the domain name PeachMoms.org — a website that never appears to have gotten past the “coming soon” phase.
Silber declined an interview when the website Gothamist rang her doorbell last month, but claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “says a lot of fake things,” Gothamist reported. Silber did not respond to an email and text message requesting comment, and a woman coming out of Silber’s apartment Thursday ignored questions from an NBC News reporter.
There are several connections between PEACH and Enriched Parenting in online and public records. PEACH is registered as a nonprofit group with New York State’s Department of State. In those state records, PEACH lists Enriched Parenting, which describes itself as dedicated to “informing parents on how to promote their children's lifelong physical and emotional well-being,” as its website. In the past, “donate” links from the Enriched Parenting site, accessed by the Internet Archive’s “Wayback Machine,” led donors to a PEACH donation page. And the website enrichedparenting.org was registered in 2015 under the email address of founder and current president Rebecca Fleischmann, and lists as its organization’s name Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health, according to historical internet domain records.
Calls and emails to Enriched Parenting and to Fleischmann were not returned. In a text from the phone number listed on Enriched Parenting’s website, a person who declined to be identified denied any association with the handbook.
A copy of the magazine, which lists Enriched Parenting among the first of eight “helpful websites,” currently appears on the Enriched Parenting website in a section labeled “assets.”
Asked about the numerous associations, another reply came via text.
“Enriched Parenting is a DBA of Parents Educating & Advocating for Children’s Health, Inc,” the text read. “Our organization is not affiliated with Peach magazine. We are an organization that supports religious, philosophical, and medical choice. We are not, nor ever have been ‘anti’ anything other than coercion and loss of civil liberties. We support informed decision making and right of choice for all parents. Our activities are geared toward education and health options on a wide variety of subjects not limited to vaccine information.”
From 2015 until the fall of 2018 — about the beginning of the current measles outbreak — Enriched Parenting’s website had a large section on its homepage dedicated to vaccines, according to historical internet records.
The entire vertical, which included dozens of articles and links to resources and research that pushed vaccine misinformation, was removed when the group rebranded and relaunched the website sometime after last August.
The rebrand came with a flashy new website, a revamped social media presence, and a less in-your-face method to anti-vaccination advocacy. Enriched Parenting seems to aspire to be a lifestyle brand.
Through Enriched Parenting, Fleischmann has hosted events featuring holistic health practitioners such as Long Island pediatrician Lawrence Palevsky, a star in the anti-vaccine world who has appeared in at least one anti-vaccine documentary, and Dr. Leonard Kundel, a dentist with disciplinary records in Connecticut and New York after being accused of improperly treating a patient in 2011, who practices a “whole body approach” to dentistry. Kundel is Fleischmann’s personal family dentist, according to her Instagram account, and keeps an “Enriched Parenting library” full of almost exclusively anti-vaccination books in his waiting room.
“I don’t associate Enriched Parenting with anti-vaccine only,” said Lena Podolsky, the manager of Kundel’s practice, who responded to a request for him to comment. “I’ve been to a couple of seminars and it's pretty cool. So I don’t think they’re controversial. They’re sort of really forward thinking.”
Other events included a “Spa Night for the Body, Mind & Soul,” which featured a homeopath who promotes herbal cures for depression and anxiety. Recently, the group has organized smaller group sessions for local chapters across six states with monthly themes like ""Bloom Where You Are Planted.""
Enriched Parenting’s Facebook page has over 1,900 followers. And its reach stretches beyond the Orthodox community, with its president and a partner contributing articles and posts in 162,000-member Stop Mandatory Vaccination, Facebook’s largest and most active private anti-vaccination group.
Moishe Kahan, 47, of Brooklyn, listed as a contributing editor in PEACH’s handbook, often posts to Enriched Parenting’s Facebook page. Along with helping administer Enriched Parenting’s page, Kahan also runs the group Jews and Vaccines, previously named Jewish Vaccine Skeptics. He did not immediately respond to emailed questions.
By Wednesday, few articles on vaccines remained on the Enriched Parenting site. An article from Binyamin Rothstein — an anti-vaccine advocate whose medical licenses were revoked in Maryland and New York in 2005 and 2012 respectively, for inappropriately treating patients with intravenous vitamins and hydrogen peroxide — suggested measles were not a threat to human life and the unvaccinated should just take Vitamin A. (Like other anti-vaccination advocates, Rothstein contends he does not oppose vaccinations, while spreading misinformation about their purported dangers.)
Rothstein, who currently leads PEACH conference calls on the Akeres Habayis Hotline, is licensed to practice in Pennsylvania, but he’s under probation by the medical board. The article was removed from the website Wednesday after an inquiry from NBC News.
Enriched Parenting’s YouTube channel and Instagram profile are still filled with anti-vaccination content.

"Last week, the House Judiciary Committee moved forward with plans for an expansive investigation into Trump World abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release a rather intemperate press statement.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-line-abortion-becomes-even-more-incendiary,msnbc,abortion,left,22.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Last week, the House Judiciary Committee moved forward with plans for an expansive investigation into Trump World abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release a rather intemperate press statement.
The congressional investigation, Donald Trump’s chief spokesperson said, is intended to “distract” the public from the Democratic agenda – which she said includes “killing babies after they’re born.”
In other words, according to the White House press secretary, Democrats support murdering children.
Yesterday, Sanders went a little further. Asked about the virtues of possibly lowering the rhetorical temperature in D.C., the president’s chief spokesperson decided to do the opposite.
“Look, I think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable of coming together and agreeing on the fact that they’re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother’s womb or killing a baby after birth.”
The use of the word “comfortable” was of particular interest – as if Democrats agree with the White House press secretary’s incendiary rhetoric.
This comes just two weeks after Donald Trump declared via Twitter, “The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth.”
The New York Times recently published a fairly detailed fact-check of these kinds of arguments, and not surprisingly, the rhetoric from Trump World is irresponsibly wrong.
But it’s also a recipe for heightened tensions and conflict. What are the prospects of cooperative governing at the federal level when the White House accuses its rivals of being pro-infanticide?
For that matter, how concerned should the public be about the White House creating potentially violent conditions with over-the-top rhetoric likely to fuel angry reactions from Trump’s far-right base?","['abuses', 'intemperate']"
"For most of his presidency, the Republican has demanded sharp cuts to legal immigration, and has made this a non-negotiable element of any deal.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/has-trump-really-reversed-course-legal-immigration,msnbc,immigration,left,22.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"The prepared text for the State of the Union included a line about immigration that likely would’ve been unremarkable – if Trump hadn’t ad-libbed five additional words.
The president was supposed to say, “Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.” But when delivering the remarks, Trump actually said, “I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever….”
It was jarring because Trump was describing the opposite of his own position. For most of his presidency, the Republican has demanded sharp cuts to legal immigration, and has made this a non-negotiable element of any deal. Even when Democrats offered him billions of dollars in wall funding in exchange for DACA protections for Dreamers, Trump balked. Without reductions to legal immigration, he said, there would be no agreement.
And yet there he was on Tuesday night, endorsing – seemingly by accident – increased legal immigration, contradicting the specific demands he made to Congress. So what’s the president’s current position? What he said in his speech or what he said before his speech? Bloomberg Politics reported yesterday:
[O]n Wednesday, Trump said he meant what he said. “Yes, because we need people in our country because our unemployment numbers are so low,” he said in an interview with regional news organizations after he was asked whether he favors a change in policy to expand legal immigration, according to a reporter for The Advocate of Louisiana.
In theory, this offers a possible breakthrough in the immigration debate. Trump’s insistence on drastic cuts to legal immigration have been a sticking point for over a year, and if the president now wants the opposite of what he demanded, it’s suddenly easier to imagine real progress on the issue.
But therein lies the rub: no one can say with any confidence what his position will be on his own agenda on any given day.
If Trump was sincere in his ad-lib, and if conservative media doesn’t tell him he has to change his mind, and if he’s prepared to sell this dramatic reversal to his far-right allies on Capitol Hill, then the president accidentally jolted the debate in a constructive way.
But because Trump has developed a reputation for being a confused leader who routinely says things he doesn’t mean, and who’s widely recognized as a poor negotiator because of his inconsistencies and willingness to vacillate, no one seems eager to get their hopes up.","['demanded', 'non-negotiable']"
"Restrictions to health care organizations that work on family planning as known as the global gag rule does extensive harm to women, especially in developing countries, but it’s nevertheless been embraced by every recent Republican administration.
",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/targeting-abortion-rights-trump-unveils-domestic-gag-rule,msnbc,abortion,left,22.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump, who was pro-choice in the not-too-distant past and never fit the mold of a far-right culture-war crusader, has taken a keen interest in abortion rights lately. The president peddled a few transparent falsehoods about reproductive rights during his State of the Union address, for example, and he reportedly had a heated confrontation with Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) over the issue at the recent National Prayer Breakfast.
Today’s news, however, takes Trump’s campaign in an even more dramatic direction.
The Trump administration says it will prohibit taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, a move certain to be challenged in court by abortion rights supporters. The policy released Friday by the Health and Human Services Department pleased religious conservatives, a key building block of President Donald Trump’s political base. The administration plan would also prohibit family planning clinics from being housed in the same location as abortion providers.
As I always do when writing about this, I want to emphasize, in the interest of disclosure, that my wife works for Planned Parenthood. And while the White House is making changes to the family-planning program known as Title X, and those changes will affect a variety of health care organizations that provide services to millions of women, it’s not exactly a secret that today’s policy is intended to target Planned Parenthood.
What’s especially notable about today’s developments is how Trump is going after the women’s health organization. The issue is not about funding for abortion services, since there are already legal prohibitions on using taxpayer money to terminate pregnancies.
Rather, the administration’s new gambit is about blocking funds for those who might mention the word “abortion.” It’s why Trump’s policy is often described as the “domestic gag rule.”
The “global gag rule” is already in place. That policy, which Trump expanded soon after taking office, prevents non-governmental organizations that work on family planning from receiving public funds and telling women that abortion exists, even in countries where abortion is legal.
Sometimes known as the “Mexico City policy,” the global gag rule does extensive harm to women, especially in developing countries, but it’s nevertheless been embraced by every recent Republican administration. (Every recent Democratic administration has rejected the policy.)
Trump now intends to apply similar restrictions to health care organizations in the United States.
The policy debate may sound complex, but it’s relatively straightforward: entities that receive family-planning funding through Title X will no longer be able to fully inform women about their reproductive options. How will this help people? It won’t. This is about imposing government regulations on health care providers, limiting what physicians are allowed to say to their patients.
Expect a whole lot of lawsuits.","['embraced', 'extensive', 'harm']"

Proponents of stricter protections for students argue the DOE’s recent rollback of Obama-era rules aimed at protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges will only lead to even more student defaulting on their loans.,https://www.alternet.org/2017/09/more-defaulting-student-loans/,alternet,student-debt,left,22.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"As the cost of higher education skyrockets, student loan debt has become an unavoidable rite of passage for most college students. Collectively, Americans owe a whopping $1.45 trillion in student loan debt, which outpaces credit card debt by upward of $600 billion. While many people consider money taken out to obtain a degree to be “good debt,” new numbers from the Department of Education (DOE) show an alarming number of Americans just can’t afford it.
After declining for four years in a row, the number of people who have defaulted on their student loans has risen to 11.5%. Though that number is still lower than it was five years ago when the default rate was 14.7% — thanks to the Obama administration’s aggressive push to offer options like income-based loan payments and its commitment to go after for-profit institutions that saddled students with mountains of debt — the uptick in defaults is not a good sign for the economy. Now, a record 8.5 millionAmericans are in default on their loans, and that number just keeps growing.
Along with the updated numbers, the DOE also listed 10 colleges whose student loan default rate is over 30%, which could result in a loss of access to federal financial aid funds. Proponents of stricter protections for students argue the DOE’s recent rollback of Obama-era rules aimed at protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges will only lead to even more student defaulting on their loans.
“Now is the time to be improving student loan policies and increasing oversight and accountability,” said Pauline Abernathy, executive vice president of the The Institute for College Access and Success. “But the Department is doing the opposite. The Department’s rollback of critical protections and enforcement will only lead to more student loan defaults, higher debt burdens, and wasted taxpayer dollars.”

What kind of protests are we talking about? In this case, pipeline protests. And as more states are passing laws to criminalize these protests, this boasting is nothing to brush off.
Oh, and lest you think the AFRM is no big deal, think again. AFRM is a corporate giant that represents many heavy-hitters in the fossil fuel world, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Koch Industries.
As first reported by Lee Fang for The Intercept, you can hear Morgan boasting about the industry’s effectiveness in pushing this legislation while at a conference in D.C. this June.
“We’ve seen a lot of success at the state level, particularly starting with Oklahoma in 2017,” Morgan stated in the leaked audio, in reference to lobbying efforts after the Dakota Access Pipeline protests got national attention in 2016.“We’re up to nine states that have passed laws that are substantially close to the model policy that you have in your pocket.”
Before we get into the laws, let’s do a quick review of what happened (and to an extent, is still happening) at Standing Rock. While there have been many protests, the Dakota Access Pipeline protests got nationwide attention when a Lakota man chained himself to a piece of construction equipment to protest the construction of a pipeline that would not only threaten clean water access but destroy spiritual grounds.","['anti-protest', 'bragged']"

HOUSTON — It’s Sage’s fifth birthday. She’s wearing a pin that tells the world, and she’s carrying a sign, too.
“Today is my 5th B-day,” it reads. “Denied school because I don’t have 39 vaccines.”
Sage’s mom, Dene Shulze-Alva, has brought her to Houston from Los Angeles to protest against vaccine laws. She’s refused to vaccinate her children and is upset that means they soon will not be able to enroll in any school in California.

She’s among four dozen or so people gathered outside on a hot late-summer morning, joining a hard core of activists who believe that all vaccines are dangerous and who have become increasingly emboldened about denouncing the medical establishment.
So Sage is spending her birthday on a narrow verge of grass in front of a Houston hotel, waving signs on a highway overpass as traffic passes by.
“Look at her. She’s 5. She’s maybe 28 pounds. I can’t inject her with the dose they are requiring,” says Shulze-Alva, a chiropractor.
None of her children are fully vaccinated, says Shulze-Alve, who smiles pleasantly and patiently lays out her arguments. And now California has eliminated personal belief and religious exemptions for vaccination, meaning children may not enroll in school if they are unvaccinated unless they have a valid medical reason.
The state tightened restrictions after a measles outbreak in 2014-15 sickened 131 people in the state and 147 nationally. State health officials said the virus was imported by a traveler, but took hold and spread among pockets of people who had unvaccinated or undervaccinated children.
“We are forced into home schooling. Sage cannot enroll in any school,” says Shulze-Alva.

Vaccine skeptics aren't new.
“Being anti-vaccine goes back to the time of Jenner,” says Dr. James Cherry, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Edward Jenner started immunizing people against smallpox in 1796. Once a killer of millions, smallpox was eradicated 200 years later after a global vaccination push.
“We are forced into home schooling.""
But the skeptics have taken on a brasher, bolder tone in recent months. They once argued that they were only for safer vaccines, but an increasing number now say most or all vaccines are dangerous, and some accuse the federal government, physicians and the “mainstream” media of colluding with drug companies to deliberately poison children using vaccines.
“It is really reaching a new level,” says Dr. Susan Wootton, associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.
“The anti-vaccine movement is a different beast in 2017 because of the rapidity with which these false stories get propagated (with) the power of the anecdote.”

There are plenty of anecdotes to go around on this hot, humid Texas morning.
Paula Bryant of Oregon said her 17-year old daughter is profoundly disabled with autism and she blames vaccines given to the child at 18 months.
“I can’t say what caused it. I can only say that three days later she could barely function,” she said.
Bryant took her daughter to a practitioner who told her the girl’s blood was full of heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, antimony and mercury. “I wondered how she got it,” she added. “The government and the people who made these vaccines know there is a dark side.”

Many of the demonstrators say they regularly fly from around the country, taking time away from work or family, to hold up signs and to step into a large bus to record video testimonials later posted on social media.
They were summoned to this particular demonstration on social media. “This is a CALL TO ACTION! Unite with us around the country and around the world! War has been waged on humanity!” declares one announcement on the We Are Vaxxed Facebook page.

“This is a runaway train,” says Tammy Johns, a life coach with three daughters who lives in the Bay Area of San Francisco. She blames her daughter’s ear infections, bronchitis, asthma and diarrhea on vaccines and rejects arguments that failure to vaccinate children puts other kids at risk.
“My first doctor bullied me,” says Johns. “He kept leading me to the (American Academy of Pediatrics) website. He said he wouldn’t see me when we refused vaccines. We just get shut down.”
Some decline to give their full names or home towns, saying they fear disapproval from friends, family or employers.
“There are some patients you are never going to convince.""
“I personally had a reaction to a tetanus shot,” says Ashley, a young woman from Lake Charles, Louisiana. ""I got rashes. I had ulcers,"" she says. ""I had three miscarriages.""
The atmosphere is friendly, relaxed and mostly polite, and they’re eager to share what they believe to be unique insights gained by spending hours on the internet.
“They know more about vaccine science than many pediatricians do,” says Dr. Jim Meehan, a former Oklahoma ophthalmologist who says he now practices “wellness” and who wanders among the demonstrators.
“You can’t rely on physicians who haven’t done their own research,” adds Meehan, who freely admits that as an eye specialist he had little formal training in vaccine science, immunology, or infectious disease.
Related: Vaccine Rumors Fueled Measles Outbreak That Put Kids in Hospital
Meehan claims that vaccines have not eradicated diseases and that many infections, such as measles, are largely harmless. He says vaccines contain dangerous additives and that testing has neglected to account for the effects of these additives.
For the record, all these claims have been repeatedly refuted. But this group doesn’t trust the debunkers, whether they’re from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, American Academy of Family Physicians, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases or the World Health Organization.
“There are some patients you are never going to convince,” said Wootton.
Johns is among those who are not convinced.
“Those who are proponents of vaccines say correlation doesn’t equal causation. But then you can’t say the same thing about vaccines – that vaccines save lives,” says Johns. Like many of the demonstrators, she dismisses the hundreds of medical studies from around the world that demonstrate that vaccines have stopped epidemics, saved millions of lives, prevented disease and are much safer than the diseases they prevent.
“Show me the kids that are not getting vaccinated that are passing on the illness and are killing people. Where are all these deadly outbreaks?” Johns demands. She need only look to Italy, where researchers reported earlier this month that low vaccination rates have caused an an epidemic of measles, with more than 4,400 cases and three deaths since January.
Another new argument — personal freedom.
“For example, our anti-vaccine movement here, Texans for Vaccine Choice, they have their own PAC now,” said Wootton. A PAC is a political action committee, which pools campaign donations for or against candidates or legislation.
“We all want to protect our kids, whether you are anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine.”
The group is lobbying against legislation that would stop parents from being able to enroll their kids in Texas schools without required vaccinations because of philosophical or religious objections.
“It’s choice of sovereignty over our own personal property,” said Sheila Hemphill, a registered lobbyist for Texas Right to Know, another group pushing to loosen vaccine requirements.
“If we turn our nation into a ‘show me your papers’ country, what will come next is forced chipping, like an animal.”

Meehan alleges cover-ups by media, the federal government and by the medical establishment fueled, he says, by pharmaceutical company dollars. “So much money is poured into mainstream media sources. You will have senior editors trying to suppress this information,” he predicted.
UCLA’s Cherry is not surprised by these arguments. “You can’t present some people with facts, because they believe what they want to believe,” he said. “When there is an obvious fact, they’ll stick with what they believed before rather than accepting the fact.”
Studies support this assertion, also. Much research has shown that debunking myths usually serves to strengthen the incorrect beliefs, not to weaken them.
Related: Why Facts Don't Change Minds
Johns has found providers who do not argue with her. “Now I see doctors who are awake, who honor informed consent,” she said.
Many of the demonstrators also decline to name their providers, or even say what their credentials are. They worry the providers might lose licenses, be censured or fined for operating outside state medical guidelines.
“If you go to enough doctors, you will find one who tells you what you want to hear,” Wootton said.
Wootton said pediatricians may not be helping by refusing to treat unvaccinated children.

“There’s a lot of debate in our field about whether to dismiss them from our clinics. I think we should keep them in our clinics to provide them high-quality care,” she said.
And she’s sympathetic to parents who see the websites, Facebook pages and other social media messages and worry about whether the vaccine skeptics are on to something.
“They are just scared and they are trying to make the right decision for their kids and we can all empathize with them,” she said. “We all want to protect our kids, whether you are anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine.”","['brasher', 'bolder']"

"The safe, heavily researched HPV vaccine remains tragically under-used — and anti-vaccine movies and conferences could make it more so if we’re not careful.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/hpv-vaccine-trial-anti-vaxxers-mobilize-against-effective-cancer-prevention-ncna1033161,msnbc,vaccines,left,23.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"New research shows that the HPV vaccine is exceeding expectations in protecting individuals from HPV infection and precancerous cells. The study’s lead author, Mélanie Drolet, touts the potential “elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem.” The new study, which is an analysis of 60 million individuals from 14 countries, found that vaccination protected both the vaccinated and the larger population via a “herd immunity” effect. In other words, even those who were not vaccinated were indirectly protected. And while HPV is most typically associated with cervical cancer, the virus can also cause other cancers, such as anal and penile cancer, and cancers of the head and neck, as well as nonfatal conditions such as genital warts.
This is all great news. It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers?
It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers?
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the leading lights of the anti-vaccine movement, recently published a lengthy article intent on scaring parents and teens away from the HPV vaccine. A new anti-vaccine documentary, “Vaxxed 2: The People’s Truth,” will reportedly focus on the HPV vaccine. This follows three other films which similarly attack this vaccine. They have even hosted an entire conference on the topic.

I asked Dr. Abbey Berenson, an Ob/Gyn at the University of Texas Medical Branch who studies women’s health and the HPV vaccine, why this vaccine in particular has become such a target of the anti-vaxxer crowd. She suggested four reasons for why it’s recently generated such controversy. Some of these have to do with the vaccine’s efficiency and others are based more in abstract questions of morality, which is reflective of the changing nature of the anti-vaccine movement as a whole. No longer are anti-vaxxers simply claiming vaccines cause autism, as they once did. Now the movement has become more complicated and its motivations at once more diverse and more obscure.

First, she noted that many don’t realize the magnitude of the risk from HPV infection. “More than 80 percent of sexually active individuals will acquire an infection during their lifetime,"" Berenson told me. Once they have the virus, many will clear it without further issues, but the virus lingers in about 10 percent of infected women and can lead to precancerous cervical lesions. While these abnormalities can often be caught by Pap smears and removed by procedures such as LEEP (a minor surgical procedure), such medical interventions that may be painful and psychologically distressful. And they can be largely avoided now via vaccination. (Full disclosure: I’ve had a LEEP procedure previously, and it was both painful and a cause of later stress.)
Counterintuitively, these interventions, which prevent early stage pre-cancers from progressing, add to the misconception promoted by anti-vaxxers “that HPV is rare, and that cervical cancer is even more rare,” cautions Berenson. If it is so rare, some opponents of the vaccine argue, why do we need a vaccine? The reality is that many cervical cancer deaths are only prevented by screening and surgical removal of these pre-cancerous cells; the vaccine can prevent those pre-cancers from occurring in the first place.
Morality also comes into play here. An early argument against the vaccine was that it would promote promiscuity; multiple studies have demonstrated it doesn’t. Even so, “social conservatives have used this argument to counter HPV vaccine mandates, arguing that it would infringe on the rights of parents to discuss sex with their children when and how they want to,” says Berenson. It’s understandable that the idea of frank discussions about sex is concerning to parents — I have two teens myself — but avoidance only leaves them vulnerable to infection.

Then there’s the idea that the vaccine hasn’t been tested enough. “Though it has been on the market in the U.S. for 13 years, there is the misconception that the vaccine is still ‘new,’” notes Berenson. Yet there are newer vaccines that lack such controversy, including several of the vaccines that prevent meningitis.
Anti-vaxxers are playing into Americans’ existing fears and concerns about “Big Pharma,” a savvy strategy right now.
And finally, people may think that because protection is not perfect, it’s not worth getting (something also known as the “Nirvana fallacy""). One of the first HPV vaccines, Gardasil, protected against four strains of HPV: types 6 and 11, which cause genital warts, and types 16 and 18, which cause cancer. Berenson notes that as there are over 100 types of HPV, this vaccine did not prevent infection from all of them — but it’s still highly effective. The new version, Gardasil-9, adds protection against five more types of cancer-causing viruses, and is estimated to prevent about 90 percent of cervical cancers.
Money is also a factor. Anti-vaxxers are playing into Americans’ existing fears and concerns about “Big Pharma,” a savvy strategy right now. But the fact is that most vaccines make very little money for drug companies. The HPV vaccine is one of the few that has been profitable for the manufacturer (drug company Merck). But this is relatively rare in the vaccine industry. Many companies have abandoned the vaccine business due to low profit margins. For Merck, global sales for the first quarter of 2019 totaled $10.8 billion; Gardasil and Gardasil-9 accounted for $838 million of that sum. That seems high, but it should be noted that figure is sales, not necessarily profits. In the U.S., vaccination has been found to be cost-effective when compared to treatment of HPV-associated cancers. And while anti-vaxxers may suggest physicians who recommend the vaccine are profiting, research shows that vaccines as a whole are often money-losers for doctors. They recommend vaccines because they work, not because they are making doctors wealthy.
As part of the government’s Healthy People 2020 goals, 80 percent of adolescents would be vaccinated for HPV by age 15. We’re currently hitting about half that rate nationally, with considerable variation state-by-state. In contrast, Ireland has recently increased their HPV vaccination rate to 70 percent; in Australia, where the vaccine was developed, about 75 percent of boys and 80 percent of girls are vaccinated. We can do better.
We have a vaccine that prevents an assortment of cancers, but we cannot allow misinformation and anti-scientific mumbo jumbo to slow our progress. The HPV vaccine remains under-used, and anti-vaccine movies and conferences could make it more so if we’re not careful. We all need to step it up to protect our children: parents, physicians, legislators. Fighting an organized misinformation machine is an upward climb, but 60 million kids have shown the benefits of the vaccine. Australia is setting its sights on the elimination of cervical cancer. We sent a man to the moon; surely we can fight harder against a mere virus — and those determined to enable it.

"Two years after the Trump administration made the state-sanctioned kidnapping of children at the border official U.S. policy, the horrors around this crime against humanity continue to be exposed.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/unpublished-watchdog-report-exposes-the-continuing-horrors-of-trumps-family-separation-2-years-later/,alternet,immigration,left,24.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Two years after the Trump administration made the state-sanctioned kidnapping of children at the border official U.S. policy, the horrors around this crime against humanity continue to be exposed. According to an unpublished Homeland Security watchdog report obtained by BuzzFeed News, officials ripped apart dozens of families who had asked for asylum at U.S. ports of entry in 2018, despite public assurances that certain parents and children there wouldn’t be targeted.
“The report found that 40 children in this group were separated from their parents for at least four weeks, although one didn’t see their family for more than a year,” BuzzFeed News’ Hamed Aleaziz reported. The report said that in one instance, officials separated a Guatemalan mother from all four of her children, including a 5-month-old infant. “The family was separated for seven weeks. The mother told inspector general investigators that she would no longer be able to nurse her child as a result,” Aleaziz reported.
The BuzzFeed News report said that former Homeland Security Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen had claimed families arriving at a port of entry would be separated only under very specific circumstances, including if the child was at risk, saying: “DHS is not separating families legitimately seeking asylum at ports of entry. If an adult enters at a port of entry and claims asylum, they will not face prosecution for illegal entry. They have not committed a crime by coming to the port of entry.”
But according to the unpublished Homeland Security inspector general report: “Between May and June 2018, Office of Field Operations staff, operating without clear guidance, separated at least 35 asylum-seeking families at ports of entry for reasons other than the children’s welfare or a ‘legal requirement,’ such as criminal warrants,” BuzzFeed News said. “One CBP official had said publicly in July 2018 that there had only been seven separations at the ports of entry during this time period.”
To be clear, no family should have been separated, whether or not they arrived at a U.S. port of entry, and this report continues to expose a brutal and inhumane practice by federal immigration officials to terrorize families to this very day.
Outraged advocates raised alarms last month that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials were presenting parents detained with their kids at migrant family jails with a cruel “binary choice”—either agree to have their kids released without them, or remain jailed together indefinitely. While ICE denied this, the agency’s own words said otherwise because a report it submitted to a court on the status of detained families lists row after row of “parent does not wish to separate.”
Caught in the act, ICE officials jumped into denial mode, offering three statements on their separation attempts, immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez tweeted. Nielsen lied, and so did ICE.
Earlier this year, Physicians for Human Rights said family separation constituted “cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment” that rose “to the level of torture,” further concluding it was a form of enforced disappearance, “which is prohibited under international law in all circumstances,” they wrote. The physicians interviewed 26 adults and children who were separated by the administration, which ultimately kidnapped nearly 5,500 children in total. Some families, the physicians said, were ripped apart without so much as a chance to say goodbye.
“Nine of the 17 parents reported to PHR clinicians that immigration authorities abruptly separated them from their children and that they were prohibited from saying goodbye or consoling them,” the report said. “Immigration authorities forcibly removed children from their parents’ arms, removed parents while their children slept, or simply ‘disappeared’ the children while their parents were in different holding cells or receiving medical care.”","['kidnapping', 'horrors', 'crime', 'against', 'humanity']"
The ideas promoted by anti-vaccination groups — which rely on pseudoscience and conspiracy theories about the government and pharmaceutical companies — are false.,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/anti-vaccination-groups-still-crowdfunding-facebook-despite-crackdown-n1064981,msnbc,vaccines,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Activists planning to line California roadways with anti-vaccination billboards full of misinformation are paying for them through Facebook fundraisers, despite a platform-wide crackdown on such campaigns.
According to organizers, the billboards will feature the faces of two children whose parents claim were killed by vaccines, though the claims are contrary to medical evidence. Catelin Clobes, the mother of one of the pictured children, raised $16,304 for the campaign through 491 Facebook users and says the funds have paid for billboards in Modesto, Sacramento and Merced, the first of which is set to go up this month.
The billboards will include the website address for the Informed Consent Action Network, the nation’s best-funded anti-vaccination group. Del Bigtree, the former daytime television producer who leads the group, told NBC News he was unaware of the campaign.
Clobes’ fundraiser is one of dozens on Facebook that have raised money recently for anti-vaccination campaigns and nonprofits, despite the company’s announcement in April of a restriction on vaccine misinformation fundraising. At least $27,000 has been raised on Facebook in the last six months for such efforts.
Recent campaigns have funded billboards and bus signs, organized anti-vaccination events and paid for the maintenance of what’s known as the “Vaxxed Bus,” an RV emblazoned with the title of an anti-vaccination documentary that prominent anti-vaccination activists used to travel on a nationwide tour.
The fundraisers underscore the challenge of content moderation on Facebook’s massive scale, where hundreds of millions of people post billions of times each week. While Facebook’s crackdown halted fundraising for the biggest anti-vaccination groups on the platform, smaller groups and individual fundraisers have fallen through the cracks, NBC News found.

Facebook responded to questions from NBC News about several active anti-vaccination campaigns by closing one fundraiser, but many remain.
""We partner with leading public health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which have publicly identified verifiable vaccine hoaxes,” a Facebook spokesperson wrote in an email to NBC News. “If these vaccine hoaxes appear on Facebook, we will take action against them, including the removal of access to our fundraising tools.""
Public health officials say the science on vaccines is clear: They are both safe and essential to protecting the health of vulnerable populations, including infants and the elderly. The ideas promoted by anti-vaccination groups — which rely on pseudoscience and conspiracy theories about the government and pharmaceutical companies — are false.
The current anti-vaccination movement was built on Facebook and other social media platforms, as well as crowdfunding sites, which spread their message and financed their various campaigns. But in recent months — amid rising concern over vaccine hesitancy and the worst measles outbreak in decades — the platforms that amplified and funded a conspiracy movement have taken steps to muzzle it.
Following similar decisions by Pinterest and YouTube, Facebook announced in March that it would limit the reach of anti-vaccination content, no longer serve up anti-vaccination groups and pages in search results and the recommendations bar, and stop accepting ad buys from users and groups that spread vaccine misinformation. Then, in April, after GoFundMe and Indiegogo both banned anti-vaccine campaigns, Facebook widened its anti-vaccination restrictions to include fundraising.
Facebook soon removed the largest anti-vaccination groups from its list of nonprofits eligible to receive fundraising donations. In 2018, prominent anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy’s Children's Health Defense fund raised $30,000 on the platform, and a month before Facebook’s announcement, activist Brandy Vaughan raised more than $8,000 for a billboard campaign from her anti-vaccination group, the Council for Vaccine Safety. Today, both groups are no longer listed among Facebook’s eligible nonprofits.
The donation pages for other anti-vaccination groups that once raised funds through Facebook, including Bigtree’s Informed Consent Action Network and Physicians for Informed Consent, currently read, “This content is no longer available.”
While the largest anti-vaccination groups have been effectively cut off, smaller individual activists who make up the movement have responded with creative workarounds. Many have continued to host fundraisers through the platform, concealing the nature of their campaign to evade Facebook’s enforcement, swapping the word “vaccines” for terms like “medical freedom” or “informed choice.” Other groups, including National Vaccine Information Center, the country’s oldest anti-vaccination nonprofit with more than 218,000 Facebook “likes,” have used outside services that manipulate Facebook’s layout to include custom donation tabs on their page.
“The harder platforms go with bans, the harder users will go to circumvent those bans,” said Ysabel Gerrard, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield’s Department of Sociological Studies, who researches content moderation and sits on Facebook's Suicide and Self-Injury Advisory Board.
Evading moderators “becomes a pleasurable cat-and-mouse game,” Gerrard said. “Communications become more insular and more niche, and you add a new level of pleasure when you ban something.”
“The people who are really hardcore into a community will evade bans,” Gerrard added. “But moderating hopefully restricts new people from finding the community.”
Six personal fundraisers on Facebook are currently raising money for First Freedoms, a nonprofit led by the author of a prominent anti-vaccination book that falsely alleges vaccines are dangerous and the CDC has conspired with pharmaceutical companies and the American Academy of Pediatrics to keep that information from the public.
First Freedoms has raised thousands of dollars on the platform in recent months for a campaign to keep religious exemptions to vaccines intact in New York State. Its page is loaded with videos that push vaccine conspiracies, including that the CDC over-hypes measles outbreaks to scare the public and that New York’s exemption legislation is fueled by an “unholy alliance between the pharmaceutical industry and government.”

"Liberal economist and New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman, in a scathing column this week, warns that extreme events like the wildfires that have been devastating Australia are a preview of things to come — and he stresses that right-wing politicians who deny the reality of climate change are as great a threat as the events themselves.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/a-historical-turning-point-paul-krugman-warns-that-disaster-in-australia-is-a-sign-were-barreling-down-the-road-to-hell/,alternet,environment,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Although wildfires were causing death and destruction long before climate change, such disasters are getting worse: more common, more widespread, more intense. Climate change didn’t invent wildfires any more than it invented hurricanes, floods or tornadoes, but it is making them worse. Liberal economist and New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman, in a scathing column this week, warns that extreme events like the wildfires that have been devastating Australia are a preview of things to come — and he stresses that right-wing politicians who deny the reality of climate change are as great a threat as the events themselves.
“In a rational world,” Krugman writes, “the burning of Australia would be a historical turning point. After all, it’s exactly the kind of catastrophe climate scientists long warned us to expect if we didn’t take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.”
But Krugman goes on to lament that “the world isn’t rational. In fact, Australia’s anti-environmentalist government seems utterly unmoved as the nightmares of environmentalists become reality. And the anti-environmentalist media, the Murdoch empire in particular, has gone all-out on disinformation, trying to place the blame on arsonists and ‘greenies’ who won’t let fire services get rid of enough trees.”
The “Murdoch empire” Krugman is referring to is, of course, the one led by 88-year-old media mogul Rupert Murdoch, a Melbourne, Australia native and founder of Fox News’ parent company, News Corp. One of the silliest talking points at News Corp. is that environmentalists are largely to blame for the Australian wildfires because they have been overly protective of the trees that are now burning.
As destructive as the Australian wildfires have been, Krugman warns, diehard climate change deniers are unlikely to be swayed by science.
“If a nation in flames isn’t enough to produce a consensus for action — if it isn’t even enough to produce some moderation in the anti-environmentalist position — what will?” Krugman asserts. “The Australia experience suggests that climate denial will persist come hell or high water — that is, through devastating heatwaves and catastrophic storm surges alike.”
Right-wing climate change deniers, according to Krugman, are as problematic in Canberra (the Australian capital) as they are in Washington, D.C.
“Very few of the people still denying the reality of climate change or at least opposing doing anything about it will be moved by further accumulation of evidence, or even by a proliferation of new disasters,” Krugman warns. “Any action that does take place will have to do so in the face of intractable right-wing opposition.”
One possible solution, Krugman writes, is to appeal to voters’ self-interest by promoting the economic and job-creating benefits of a Green New Deal.
“Can such a strategy succeed?” Krugman asks. “I don’t know. But it looks like our only chance given the political reality in Australia, America, and elsewhere — namely, that powerful forces on the right are determined to keep us barreling down the road to hell.”",['scathing']

"Trump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/here-are-5-of-trumps-lies-from-his-oval-office-speech-about-his-ridiculous-border-wall-demands/,alternet,immigration,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Speaking to the country for the first time from the Oval Office Tuesday night, President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for a border wall in a brief speech amid his self-induced government shutdown
Democrats remain completely opposed to the president’s proposal for a wall and arranged to respond to Trump’s remarks shortly after he made them. Ahead of the speech, there was widespread debate about the TV network’s decision to broadcast the speech at all, given Trump’s propensity to lie and mislead about this subject in particular.
Here are five of the lies or misleading statements he made in the address:
1. Trump claimed there is a “security” crisis on the border.
While there has been an increase in children and families crossing the border seeking asylum in recent months, the rate of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is actually much lower than it has been in recent history, as Vox’s Dara Lind explained. The Trump administration’s claims that there is some sort of terrorism risk from the border have been debunked. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.
2. Trump said illegal immigration drives down wages.
One of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. While some economists argue this to be the case for some lower-income workers, many others disagree. But even if it’s true, the impact of immigrants on wages is marginal, and it could be completely wiped out by pro-labor policies that Trump and other Republicans oppose, like raising the minimum wage and protecting unions.
3. Trump lied and said that the Democrats requested a “steel barrier.”
Democrats have not requested a steel barrier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants to spend exactly $0 on the wall — no matter what it’s made out of.
4. Trump said the border wall will pay for itself.
Trump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. There’s no reason to believe this is the case — especially when it’s considered that the government will not only have to pay for the construction of the wall, but for any land seized to build the wall through eminent domain.
5. Trump said the new version of NAFTA will also pay for the wall.
The new version of NAFTA, which Trump calls USMCA, has some minor modifications from the original version. However, there’s no plausible argument that it will somehow pay for the wall. And even if it did, it hasn’t even been passed by Congress yet.",['bizarre']
"In Philadelphia, there were also reports that the city was ignoring social distancing standards by cramming their new voting machines (one per jurisdiction) into multi-precinct voting locations, which forced voters and poll workers to stand on top of each other.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/we-just-got-a-sneak-peek-of-what-the-november-election-could-look-like/,alternet,elections-2020,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"More in-person voting sites in metro areas. Better information about where polls have been relocated. More public education about how to vote from home and what to do if an absentee ballot doesn’t arrive—or arrives at the last minute. And no last-minute government decisions that confuse voters and undermine voting, such as imposing curfews before the polls close.
These are some of the takeaways from the nine presidential primaries that took place on June 2, the largest day of voting across America since the pandemic broke in mid-March, where most of the states and the District of Columbia responded by shifting to voting with mailed-out ballots rather than voting centered on local polling places as in previous elections.
The approaches taken in these states and districts varied and reflected the trends seen across the United States. Montana and Maryland mailed ballots to voters. Washington, D.C., and four states sent voters applications to get a mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania and Indiana left it up to voters to apply for an absentee ballot, get the ballots on time, and submit it on time to be counted.
The results were a spectrum of well-run to more-problematic elections. Montana, which is used to voting by mail, had higher turnout than its 2018 fall midterm. But many voters who were not used to voting from home, especially in metro areas, did not get ballots as expected. They went to vote in person, but often found traditional polling places closed. They ended up in long lines and sometimes faced hours-long waits, where social distancing could be challenging, and, in the worst case—in Washington—police were telling voters to go home because of a curfew.
These trends, both better and worse, offer lessons and warning signs for the fall’s elections.
“Overall, this is a dry run for November,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs the nation’s largest Election Day hotline and fielded more than 5,000 calls for the primaries. “We’re bracing for high turnout that we will see in the November general election, and lessons learned from this primary season must guide states… to ensure that every eligible voter can have their voice heard.”
“It is clear that the pandemic is having an impact on virtually every aspect of the voting experience,” she said, noting that impact was apart from a curfew in Washington that was announced by a text alert on Election Day that “did not have an exception making it clear that voters can, indeed, continue to travel to cast their ballot.”
Voting in quasi-militarized settings was not confined to the nation’s capital. In Philadelphia, on election eve, the mayor announced a curfew that was slated to take effect an hour before its polls closed, but subsequently delayed it after an outcry by other city officials and activists. The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism. However, the curfews also come in a climate where the Republican Party, led by President Trump, has been repeatedly making false claims that voting by mail is rife with fraud.
“This is simply not true,” wrote the National Vote at Home Institute’s Amber McReynolds and MIT’s Charles Stewart III, both experts, for the Hill. They noted that the right-wing Heritage Foundation’s oft-cited election fraud database listed 204 cases and 143 convictions using mailed ballots in the past 20 years, where “about 250 million votes have been cast by a mail ballot.” That activity level is “about five times less likely than getting hit by lightning in the United States.”
But while partisan propaganda about voting by mail is only likely to increase as the general election nears, the nuts-and-bolts challenges of shifting to voting by mail in states that have not widely instituted that process is very much a work in progress. In that sense, the statewide and district primaries on June 2, as well as dozens of elections that will be held now through the summer, are microcosms of what is working and what needs to be fixed for the fall.
A Spectrum of States
The June 2 primaries featured jurisdictions with more and less experience running mail-based elections. On the most experienced side, Montana, where the senior statewide election official is a Republican, continued its practice of mailing all voters a ballot. More people voted for its 2020 primary than during the state’s November 2018 midterms.
“Sixty-three percent of active registered voters,” said Phil Keisling, the National Vote at Home Institute’s board chair and former Oregon secretary of state. “That’s higher than 41 states in their midterms in 2018. That’s the power of mailing everyone a ballot.”
While Montana was an example of how voter turnout will increase in states where voters have become used to voting from home, the experience in Midwestern and Eastern states that have not embraced voting from home until the pandemic was rockier was a different story—and not just because of the pandemic’s social distancing requirements or police presence due to widespread protests.
In Pennsylvania’s largest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, Maryland, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, election officials underestimated the number of people who sought to vote in person for any number of reasons: from not getting a mail-in ballot; to getting a ballot late and wanting to drop it off; to simply wanting to vote in a polling place.
While Pennsylvania’s top officials reported a “smooth election amid historic circumstances” as 1.8 million residents applied for an absentee ballot, “17 times greater than the number who applied” in its 2016 presidential primary, voting rights advocates manning election-protection hotlines observed a different experience. The Lawyers’ Committee said that 55 percent of the calls received on June 2 were from Pennsylvania—and from people unable to vote by mail.
Half of the hotline calls concerned finding a polling place, the Committee’s Lacy Crawford said. Another 17 percent concerned ballots—meaning unfamiliarity with mailed-out ballots versus polling place voting. Another 13 percent concerned voter registration. Of slightly less than half of the callers who reported their race, 63 percent were Black, 21 percent were white and 12 percent were Latino.
The takeaway from the committee briefings, where its partners summarized what they were hearing from hundreds of observers, underscored that accommodating the fall’s voters will mean planning for high levels of voting from home—but still significant in-person voting at precincts. That conclusion is what emerges after hearing detailed reports of snafus.
“The big theme of the day is confusion,” said Ivan Garcia, civic engagement director for MakeTheRoadPA.org. “Voters are turning up to their old polling place and not always finding directions to the consolidated poll place that they should be going to. Because of the large number of voters at each poll, poll workers are having trouble finding voters in the poll books—if they even have the poll books. In the worst situations, they are being turned down and turned away so that they cannot vote.”
Garcia also said that many voters had not received a mail-in ballot—even though they said they had applied. When they turned up at vote centers, some poll workers were unfamiliar with the procedures to let them vote. (In some states, poll workers can look up that voter in an electronic poll book and cancel their mail-in ballot, allowing them to vote with a regular ballot. In other states, they must fill out a form to get a provisional ballot.)
“We are seeing voters who requested mail-in ballots who never received them,” he said. “They are turning out to their polling place to vote. And instead of voting provisionally, which is what is supposed to happen, they are being turned away as well. There have been lots of phone calls asking about the clarification about the deadlines for returning mail ballots based on the executive order that Gov. [Tom] Wolf signed yesterday [June 1]. The length of the lines is increasing as we get to the end of the day. There’s been problems in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.”
In Indianapolis, election officials also underestimated the number of in-person voters.
“One thing we learned from our colleagues in Indiana is that even in these challenging circumstances in the Midwest and nationally, voters have really shown a quiet resolve to persevere and to exercise their right to vote today,” said Ami Gandhi, with the committee’s Chicago chapter, which was assisted by Common Cause in Indiana. “The majority of calls we received so far are people needing clarification on where their polling place is… Some voters, especially in Indianapolis, have been facing long lines and congestion… We’re also getting many questions about absentee ballots by voters not comfortable with voting in person.”
These comments reflect that some voters, in response to the pandemic, clearly want to vote from home—one trend that is likely to continue into the fall’s general election. Yet, at the same time, the comments also reflect that many voters who did not get an absentee ballot, for any number of reasons, still wanted to find a way to vote in person. (This was apart from police in some locations, namely Washington, telling voters to leave because of a pending curfew.)
More Takeaways
The June 2 experience had other lessons. In Pennsylvania, where state law does not allow local election officials to start processing mail-in ballots before Election Day and the governor’s order will allow ballots postmarked by June 2 to arrive up to a week later and still be counted, the official results in some contests will not be known for days—which will recur this fall. It’s not known whether the state’s legislature will act to allow counting to start earlier in the fall.
There were other lessons. In Baltimore, where a contractor for the city delivered paper ballots to one district that were not properly printed, that caused a series of cascading problems that will take days to unwind—from voters casting ballots that will not count, to reconciling votes and declaring official outcomes in city races.
That printing error is a warning sign for states or counties that anticipate printing unprecedented volumes of paper ballots in the fall. However, because Maryland is a state offering same-day voter registration, most issues affecting voters could be solved on Election Day at in-person voting sites.
In Washington, one reaction to not getting ballots into voters’ hands was to email voters the ballot—to be printed at their home and then submitted. That response was quickly criticized by cybersecurity advocates, saying it offered a hacking pathway (even though some states have been sending ballots this way to soldiers stationed overseas).
In Philadelphia, there were also reports that the city was ignoring social distancing standards by cramming their new voting machines (one per jurisdiction) into multi-precinct voting locations, which forced voters and poll workers to stand on top of each other. There also were reports from other counties that election officials did not put ballot drop boxes in visible locations.
Stepping back, however, it appeared that apart from Montana’s 63 percent record turnout, a quarter to a third of the registered voters in states that were expanding at-home voting for the first time ended up casting mail-in ballots on June 2, according to the National Vote at Home Institute’s Keisling.
“If we knew how many mailed-out ballots went out, you could apply an 80 percent rule—if 100,000 go out, 80,000 will come back,” he said, adding that not every state will post this information. “It varies a bit, but that’s the general rule, plus or minus 5 percent… All you need to do is look at the total votes [cast] and what’s the difference [subtracting that mail-in ballot estimate]. Those [remaining voters] are the people who showed up at a polling place.”
In other words, looking to the fall, record numbers of voters will be casting mail-in ballots. But sizable numbers of voters will still be looking to vote in person. Election officials will have to adequately prepare for both voting options.

"Now, the data shows there is an aftershock in the form of the looming tsunami of student debt defaults that will hit communities of color the hardest, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics and Demos, a progressive think tank.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/05/the-real-moral-hazard-is-ignoring-the-student-debt-crisis-and-its-devastating-effect-on-the-economy/,alternet,student-debt,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"As the ranks of Democratic Party 2020 presidential hopefuls continue to swell and Trump’s chaotic lawlessness proliferates it’s easy to miss a deepening crisis that’s already taking a toll on millions of households and is about to get much worse.
It has metastasized way beyond a talking point on a candidate’s laundry list. Left unaddressed it will consign generations to poverty, further accelerate wealth and income disparity and knee-cap the nation’s economic prospects as even fewer adults can afford to form a family.
Student debt that was at $521 billion in 2006, has now spiked to $1.57 trillion, more than a 200 percent increase. That puts it second only to the nation’s aggregate mortgage debt and a half-trillion more than America’s total credit card bill.
According to the Urban Institute, every fiscal quarter another 250,000 student borrowers see their loans go into default, that’s one million a year. Currently, 11.5 percent of the nation’s student loans are in default but the Urban Institute is projecting by 2023, in just four years, that default rate will approach a near catastrophic 40 percent.
A college loan default becomes even more ruinous when the student drops out before getting a degree. Currently, 56 percent of students drop-out by year six. At that point, a young adult life is economically underwater since dropouts earn 35 percent less, that’s an average $21,000 less a year, than their classmates that persevered to graduation are earning.
In many ways, this deepening crisis builds on the Great Recession when Americans lost $20 trillion in household wealth. That erosion of an economic foundation that had taken generations to build and its harvesting by Wall Street was most keenly felt by African-Americans.
Now, the data shows there is an aftershock in the form of the looming tsunami of student debt defaults that will hit communities of color the hardest, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics and Demos, a progressive think tank.
“Not only are students of color more likely to borrow more for a degree, and borrow in higher amounts for the same degree, but they’re more likely to struggle to repay student loans than white students,” Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst for Demos told Student Loan Hero. “Students of color are also overrepresented at for-profit colleges and universities which account for a very large proportion of student loan defaults.”
“Among black students who started school in 2003, one in two defaulted on student loans within the following 12 years,” reported Student Loan Hero.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Jerome Powell testified that it was “not something you can pick up in the data right now” but, he added, the student debt overhang casts a real shadow over the nation’s economic future.
“You do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can’t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life,” Powell testified. “As this goes on and as student loans continue to grow and become larger and larger, then it absolutely could hold back growth.”
“As young adults struggle to pay back their loans, they’re forced to make financial concessions that create a drag on the economy,” reported Bloomberg. “Student debt has delayed household formation and led to a decline in home-ownership. Sixteen percent of young workers age 25 to 35 lived with their parents in 2017, up four percent from 10 years prior, shows Bloomberg Intelligence.”
But this is not just exclusively an issue for twenty- or thirty- somethings. Thanks to former Vice President Joe Biden, who as Delaware’s Senator did the banks’ bidding and made student debt non-dischargeable via bankruptcy, no generation escapes the student loan indenture.
It’s a predatory policy that even a conservative like Powell was hard-pressed to explain in his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. “Alone among all kinds of debt, we don’t allow student loan debt to be discharged in bankruptcy,” Powell testified. “I’d be at a loss to explain why that should be the case.”
In February the Wall Street Journal reported that Americans over 60 were saddled with $86 billion in student loan deb, a spike of 161 percent from 2010 and 2017.
Often the loans were the result of either borrowing for their children’s education or borrowing they racked up to put themselves through college or graduate school.
The Journal reported that a few years back the government resorted to attaching social security benefits and income tax refunds belonging to 40,000 seniors 65 or older for loan repayment, more than a three-fold increase 362 percent just ten years ago.
According to research by the Interdisciplinary Association for Population Health Science there are millions of parents too young to retire with little set aside, but who have taken on substantial borrowing for their children’s education.
“Meanwhile, the average near-retirement household has only about $12,000 in retirement savings, indicating that they are unprepared not only for retirement, but also for unexpected financial shocks,” wrote Dr. Katrina Walsemann, Director of Health Promotion, Education, and Behavior at the University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health. “Add more debt to these households, and parents may find themselves suffering undue financial stress. The potential negative impact of such stress is well documented, particularly as it relates to psychological well-being.”
She continues, “For example, financial debt has been linked to poorer mental health, greater anxiety, and shorter sleep.
Perhaps equally pressing are the health-related economic trade-offs that parents may make as they transition to retirement and fixed incomes. Paying down student loans may force parents to choose, for instance, between paying their loan and paying for medication or even food.”
Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren released a $1.25 trillion proposal to cancel most student loan debt and provide tuition-free public college.
Under her proposal up to $50,000 in student loan debt would be zeroed out for every person with a household income of less than $100,000 and borrowers with incomes between $100,000 and $250,000 would be eligible for some college debt relief.
“This touches people’s lives,” Ms. Warren told the New York Times in an interview. “This is a chance to talk about what’s broken and how we fix it. This is the American dream.”
In her first-person post on Medium Warren recounted her own experience pursuing higher education in a time and place when “tuition was just $50 a semester” and got her degree enabling her to become a teacher for students with special needs.
“Higher education opened a million doors for me,” she wrote.
“It’s how the daughter of a janitor in a small town in Oklahoma got to become a teacher, a law school professor, a U.S. Senator, and eventually, a candidate for President of the United States.”
But she rightly notes it is “virtually impossible for a young person to find that kind of opportunity.”
Up until now, any call for serious consideration of student debt relief has been drowned out by the voices of those who paid off their student loans and see the delinquency of others as a sign of the debtor’s moral defect. And, as with any multi-billion-dollar meltdown, there’s plenty of blame to go around.
Yet, as she often does so well, Warren flags the systemic failures that are the real drivers of the crisis.
“As states have invested less per-student at community colleges and public four-year colleges, the schools themselves have raised tuition and fees to make up the gap,” Warren wrote. “And rather than stepping in to hold states accountable, or to pick up more of the tab and keep costs reasonable, the federal government went with a third option: pushing families that can’t afford to pay the outrageous costs of higher education towards taking out loans”.
And she recounts how every step of the way was determined by public policy choices co-opted by monied interests that bought our politics.
“We got into this crisis because state governments and the federal government decided that instead of treating higher education like our public-school system — free and accessible to all Americans — they’d rather cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations and offload the cost of higher education onto students and their families. The student debt crisis is the direct result of this failed experiment.”
In response to Warren’s proposal the editorial board of the Los Angeles Daily News warned that her proposal risked “moral hazard” by encouraging current students to “borrow as much as you can and wait for the debt to be canceled during the next presidential primary campaign.”
Hmm. When did we last hear about the dreaded perils of “moral hazard?”
As it turns out Warren’s proposal is a veritable bargain compared to the $14.4 trillion dollars it cost for the Bush-Obama Wall Street bailout.","['looming', 'tsunami']"
"While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-quarantine-protesters-america-form-unholy-covid-19-alliance-ncna1207796,msnbc,vaccines,left,25.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. At recent protests, we’ve seen the intersection of those who doubt the statistics and science behind COVID-19, primarily funded by right-wing groups, shouting alongside the distinctive red, white and black bold-lettered signs that have become the hallmark of anti-vaccine protesters.
This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.
These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message: The virus isn’t a big deal, scientists and the government are lying to you, and you can be a patriot by ignoring fear of the virus and going about your business. Ironically of course, this pandemic highlights exactly why we need vaccines.
This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits. Like anti-vaccine leader Andrew Wakefield, Mikovits pivoted from a legitimate science career to promoting antivaccine propaganda following a retraction of her most notable paper, which appeared in 2009 in the journal Science and suggested that a mouse retrovirus, XMRV, was the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unfortunately, other groups could not replicate Mikovits’s findings, and ultimately even her own lab could not do so when they tried to repeat the research using blinded samples.

In the meantime, Mikovits’s scientific career was already unraveling. A graduate student found an instance where Mikovits had falsified an image used in the XMRV paper. This finding, along with evidence of contamination in the original samples, led to a full retraction of the XMRV paper by Science. Since then, Mikovits has published two books, spinning her career downfall from something of her own doing into a case of martyrdom and mistreatment by “elites” — including Dr. Anthony Fauci. Though she claims in “Plandemic” that “she’s not anti-vaccine” (a common trope of anti-vaxxers), she has filmed interviews wearing a hat for the movie “Vaxxed II” (produced by Andrew Wakefield) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist who has compared vaccines to the Holocaust, promoted her newest book and also wrote its foreword.
In fact, most of the arguments the coronavirus deniers use are very similar to those anti-vaxxers have been pushing for decades. They suggest that scientists and scientific institutions are hopelessly corrupt, that these institutions and individuals are lying to you and only folks like Mikovits are willing to risk it all to tell you ""the truth"": that the government and specifically public health institutions should have no influence over how ordinary Americans live their lives and protect themselves and their communities from disease, and that natural immunity to infection is preferable to vaccines (even though with COVID-19, we are only beginning to learn about immunity and have no idea how long it will last, and how vaccine-induced immunity will compare to that).
Worse, anti-vaccine leaders are already spreading fear about a coronavirus vaccine that does not yet exist; at best, a vaccine is likely a year or more away from release, and they can’t possibly know anything about outcomes of human clinical trials on safety and efficacy at this time. Yet the protesters and amateur health experts are still saying it is dangerous.
While the narrative from many “reopeners” has focused on the economic damage created by lockdowns and closing of restaurants, beauty salons and other service industries, economists have pointed out that even if all of these opened tomorrow, the financial picture will not soon be healed because the virus is still out there, and many people will not yet feel safe participating in public events.
This means those who are most eager to “return to normal” are also those who seem to be least likely to take the steps that would make this possible. Instead of listening to public health experts who have emphasized a program of “test, trace, isolate” to identify new cases, anti-vaccine leaders are instead threatening to track the individuals who have signed up to assist in contact tracing efforts.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, which may help reduce viral transmission, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus,” and that “you’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions.” These claims are nonsensical, but have already made the rounds in anti-vaccine circles, convincing individuals that masks are more dangerous than the virus.
Troublingly, almost 20 percent of Americans currently say they’d be the last to get the vaccine if it was available, or wouldn’t get it at all.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus.""
We just finished a year in which measles cases were higher than they were at any point in the past quarter century. While exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases may be relatively low right now because of distancing measures, the last few months have also seen a decline in children seeing physicians for wellness checks and routine vaccinations, putting children at an increased risk upon reopening. And despite suggestions from President Donald Trump that the virus will go away without a vaccine, we need to be prepared to deal with this epidemic for years rather than months.
Luckily, this is an area where everyone can pitch in to help. If you have friends and family who are hesitant about vaccines, gently discussing with them why you think they are important may help to sway their opinion.

Sowers is an offensive assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers, whose win against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday secured the team's spot in the championship game Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. The 49ers will face off against the Kansas City Chiefs.
She is the second woman to coach in the National Football League and began her athletic career playing in the Women’s Football Alliance for the West Michigan Mayhem and the Kansas City Titans. After retiring in 2016 because of a hip injury, Sowers joined the NFL as an intern for the Atlanta Falcons, and took the assistant coach position with the 49ers the next year.
Sowers became the first out gay coach in the NFL when she came out before the 2017 season.

“No matter what you do in life, one of the most important things is to be true to who you are,” she said in an interview with Outsports after coming out. “There are so many people who identify as LGBT in the NFL, as in any business, that do not feel comfortable being public about their sexual orientation.”
“By standing out and proud as the first-ever openly gay NFL coach in a Super Bowl, Katie Sowers not only shows LGBTQ athletes and fans what’s possible for them, but also shows the sport world as a whole that LGBTQ people are a valuable part of this community,” Joanna Hoffman, director of communications at the national LGBTQ athletic advocacy group Athlete Ally, wrote in an emailed statement.
“The more barriers we can break down in football and in all sports, the more LGBTQ athletes, coaches and fans will be able to be who they are and be a part of the sport they love.”
Despite achieving a historic position of leadership in the highest level of national football, Sowers said she experienced LGBTQ discrimination in sports while in college, when was rejected from a volunteer coaching job because of her “lifestyle.”
“I was so passionate about coaching and to feel like my opportunities were limited because of who I loved was hard to deal with,” Sowers told Outsports. “However, without that experience, I would not be where I am today.”
The incident encouraged the coach to use her platform to promote inclusivity. Sowers was in part responsible for the genesis of a Pride fan club for the 49ers last May, the first NFL team-sponsored group that officially recognized its LGBTQ fans. She also frequently posts pictures of her with her girlfriend on Instagram and talks about her experiences being a women's coach.
Athletes and fans are excited for Sowers' historic role at Super Bowl LIV and have remarked that her position is especially poignant given there have only been 13 out gay and bi players in the NFL's 100-year history, according to OutSports.

"Their work came on the heels of an IPCC report that warned of dire environmental, economic and health consequences in the absence of any serious momentum toward decarbonization by 2030.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/how-to-overcome-the-obstacles-to-implementing-actual-climate-change-solutions/,alternet,environment,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"by Matthew Hoffmann, University of Toronto and Steven Bernstein, University of Toronto
Work crews descended on 12 commuter parking lots in Toronto in late November 2018, and headed to the electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Their work came on the heels of an IPCC report that warned of dire environmental, economic and health consequences in the absence of any serious momentum toward decarbonization by 2030.
But the crews were not adding to the two charging stations installed in each parking lot in 2013. They came to remove them.
This erasure of one provincial government’s climate project by its successor was only the tip of the melting iceberg. The steady unravelling of climate policy began when the newly elected Conservative government cancelled the provincial cap and trade system and renewable energy contracts from Ontario’s feed-in-tariff system. It also removed subsidies for electric vehicles (up to $14,000 per vehicle under the previous government).
Despite being sold as cost-cutting, some of the reversals have been expensive. Cancelling 750 renewable-energy projects, for instance, cost $231 million.
It is tempting to view this unwinding through the lens of the polarized politics plaguing many western democracies. That misses the bigger picture.
Our research on more than two dozen climate initiatives around the world — from the community level to the global scale — revealed that the Ontario story is depressingly familiar. There is no lack of climate initiatives — our case studies are only a small cross-section of thousands. Rather, the problem is that these initiatives tend to get started, make some progress and then get stuck or even regress.
Everything is connected
Dependence on fossil energy means it is difficult for a new policy or technology in isolation to catalyze breakthrough changes. Part of the story is the pushback they generate, as happened in Ontario, from political and economic interests that mobilize opposition.
But overt resistance is not the only obstacle to change. Changing one thing often runs into the powerful inertia of related policies, technologies, interests and patterns of behaviour.
For example, a local or provincial policy to incentivize electric vehicle purchases by allowing free parking or providing subsidies may make some progress reducing emissions. But if other parts of the transportation system do not change, the policy will stall or reverse.
Without charging stations, people will have range anxiety. If subsidies decline or higher levels of government do not impose stricter fuel standards, markets for EVs can dry up. If the electric grid is supplied by dirty coal power or other high carbon fuels, EV purchases will have less effect on overall emissions. If the uptake of EVs remains low as a result, auto companies and the public may oppose such policies as costly for limited impact.
These challenging, interdependent dynamics are evident across policies and scales. Even in Germany, which implemented some of the most aggressive renewable energy policies, decarbonization has stalled despite strong public support. Pricing and policy dynamics, such as the shale gas revolution outside of Germany and the decision to phase out nuclear power, led to coal becoming the cheapest source of energy, resulting in the extension of coal-fired power plants.
The German phase-out of coal power will be complete in 2038 (too slow according to some activists) and comes with billions of Euros in compensation for coal-producing states and companies.
The purgatory of incremental change
Climate initiatives also get stuck because the momentum they generate is not always in the direction of substantial change or decarbonization. For instance, moving from coal-fired to natural gas electricity production can lower emissions. However, turning to this bridge fuel reinforces dependence on fossil energy. Political coalitions that support and benefit from such an initial change might not favour more aggressive action.
A case in point is Colorado’s New Energy Economy policy. In the mid-2000s, it included a commitment to shift from coal to renewables supported by unions and energy companies. The fracking revolution, however, lowered natural gas prices and encouraged the development of coalitions that supported it as a transition fuel.
The state government subsequently redefined the new energy economy to include natural gas, undermining its commitment to renewables. This shift put Colorado on an improved, but still carbon-intensive, pathway. The state is in the midst of changing oil and gas regulations again.
These dynamics apply equally to individuals. Studies show that nudging people to change their daily practices can decrease their support for broader, transformative policies because they feel they have done enough.
Getting unstuck
Our research has identified four questions to ask when designing and implementing climate action to counter these dynamics: Does it disrupt dependence on fossil energy? Does it build coalitions that favour more aggressive actions? Is it sensitive to broader connections? Does it spark climate action elsewhere?
These questions suggest a need to value the transformative potential of any climate action rather than (only) the immediate emissions reductions. Quick emissions reductions like those generated by fuel switching are seductive but can stall. Instead policy-makers should evaluate climate action on whether it contributes to disrupting reliance on fossil energy and reinforcing alternative paths.
Getting unstuck also requires thinking beyond single policies. A successful EV policy like Norway’s pays attention to the entire personal transport sector (taxes and subsidies, infrastructure, etc.). It has even catalyzed change in the broader transportation sector, including electric ferries and aviation.
Moreover, the politics of getting started are different than the politics of maintaining and extending climate action. One way to create broader coalitions of support is to build justice and equity into every climate action. Overly technocratic climate initiatives, such as smart cities, can get stuck and fail to catalyze broad decarbonization in part because they fail to generate broad and diverse coalitions to build on initial successes.
Building a better society is not possible without addressing climate change. Addressing climate change is not politically feasible without pursuing a more just and equitable society to ensure broad support.

"And while states like Massachusetts—among others—automatically cancel debt if a borrower dies or becomes disabled, New Jersey has chosen a different path, encouraging students to buy life insurance to cover their debt and take co-signers off the hook in the event of a tragedy",https://www.alternet.org/2016/07/nj-forces-mom-pay-sons-student-loans-murder-does-not-meet-threshold-loan-forgiveness/,alternet,student-debt,left,25.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"""Please accept our condolences on your loss,” explained a letter from the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority of New Jersey. “After careful consideration of the information you provided, the authority has determined that your request does not meet the threshold for loan forgiveness. Monthly bill statements will continue to be sent to you.”
That is the response Marcia DeOliveira-Longinetti received when she attempted to get student loan forgiven after her 23-year-old son was murdered last year, reports the New York Times.
Welcome to the world of what bankruptcy attorney Daniel Frischberg calls, “state-sanctioned loan-sharking.”
Like many states, New Jersey administers a student loan program designed to help students further their education in order to join a workforce that puts a premium on a college degree.
Where New Jersey parts ways with the other states is the degree of difficulty in getting out from under onerous loan payments despite extreme poverty, illness and even death.
According to DeOliveira-Longinetti, who co-signed her son’s loans that allowed him to attend the University of Vermont, she was shocked at the response that has forced her—so far—to make 18 payments of $180 per month to the state of New Jersey.
And she still has 92 to go.
“We’re not going to be poor because of this,” she explained. “But every time I have to pay this thing, I think in my head, this is so unfair.”
According to the Times, loans administered by New Jersey’s Higher Education Student Assistance Authority have a remarkable amount of leeway to go after anyone, with little recourse for those wading through paying back burdensome student loan debt.
Take the case of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma survivor Chris Gonzalez; after being laid off by Goldman Sachs, the federal government gave him some relief by suspending his federal student loan payments. New Jersey, on the other hand, sued him and proceeded to snap up a state tax refund he was counting on.
While Republican Gov. Chris Christie claims his hands are tied when it comes to making changes in New Jersey’s program, his appointee, Gabrielle Charette, has the power to, not only appoint at least 12 of the agency’s 18 board members, but she can veto actions taken by the board.
Years earlier New Jersey sharply expanded its loan program by replacing the federal loans it once handled with state loans, ramping up to $343 million loaned per year in 2010. While the agency has reduced lending, it still sits on a portfolio of about $2 billion in outstanding debt.
And while states like Massachusetts—among others—automatically cancel debt if a borrower dies or becomes disabled, New Jersey has chosen a different path, encouraging students to buy life insurance to cover their debt and take co-signers off the hook in the event of a tragedy

WASHINGTON — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday became the first governor in the country to refuse to take in refugees, but 18 of his 26 Republican counterparts have chosen to open the door to refugees, much to the surprise of the Trump administration.
In a September executive order, President Donald Trump gave states and local governments the right to reject refugees, but instead of saying no, most state and local officials have blindsided the administration by opting in, according to two former officials familiar with the matter.
Some of the local governments choosing to accept refugees voted heavily in favor of Trump in 2016, after an election campaign in which he vowed to clamp down on immigration and the flow of refugees — particularly Muslim refugees.
“They thought they were throwing red meat to their base. It’s a spectacular blowback for them,” said a former senior U.S. official familiar with the discussions, who did not want to be named. “It was a mistake to assume that just because it whips people up at a Trump rally, that it will have the same effect on people in a community.”
Both backers and foes of the Trump administration position attribute the unexpected support for refugees to the influence of religious groups, especially evangelical leaders, who despite the Republican leanings of their flocks have lobbied political leaders not to block refugees.
“The Southern Baptist Convention has a pretty strong history of refugee resettlement,” said Dan Darling, vice president of the denomination’s Ethics in Religious Liberty Commission, which passed a resolution supporting refugee resettlement in 2018.
“A lot of our churches on the ground are involved in caring for refugee families.” The Southern Baptists are the nation’s largest non-Catholic denomination and a major force in the Republican heartland of the Deep South.
In September, Trump signed an executive order permitting states, cities and counties, for the first time ever, to opt out of accepting international refugees.
If the localities take no action by Jan. 21, funding for refugees will be cut off, meaning there will be no resettlements there.
Only if local officials publicly say yes to refugees by that deadline do their cities and counties have to accept them. The wording means politicians would have to take a potentially unpopular position in favor of immigrants.
With the deadline less than two weeks away, governors of 41 states have opted to accept refugees, as have leaders in 86 local communities.
Meanwhile, two local governments have actively chosen to reject refugees, though no such action is needed to block resettlement. In addition, one mayor has refused to sign off on his city council's unanimous approval of taking refugees, thus preventing it from becoming official.
Seven GOP governors — including the governors of Georgia and Florida — have not announced a decision.
After several Republican governors said they would keep the door open to refugees, the White House organized a conference call with governors in November, explaining the Trump executive order and reminding them that they were not required to take any proactive steps, according to one former official. The conference call, which included Andrew Veprek, a senior Department of State official overseeing refugee policy, was first reported by the New Yorker.
The White House and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.
Lowest number in 40 years
The U.S. government established the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program in 1980, and has admitted thousands of refugees fleeing religious and political persecution. Under the program, the government works with nonprofit agencies and local authorities to resettle refugees in communities across the country.
Under the Trump administration, however, the cap on the number admitted annually has been cut repeatedly. Officials reduced the ceiling for refugee admissions to a new low of 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, the lowest since the program was established 40 years ago. That number was already down from a cap of 30,000 for FY 2019, and 45,000 for FY 2018.
The Sept. 26 executive order that cut the total to 18,000 also added the condition that cities and states must now give written confirmation that they will accept refugees in order to continue participating in the federal program.
The nation’s largest refugee organizations are run by religious denominations, and many of them, including the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, HIAS and the Church World Service, filed suit against Trump’s executive order in a Maryland federal court. A judge heard oral arguments Wednesday, and if the judge stays the order all decisions by local governments would be mooted.

“We are confident the judge will recognize that a preliminary injunction is the only way to serve justice for refugees and the communities that welcome them,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.
In addition to the suit by faith-based refugee groups, 1,600 evangelical leaders have lobbied state and local officials to keep taking refugees.
Dan Darling of the Southern Baptist Convention told NBC News he had been surprised by the pro-refugee “ripple effect around the country” among GOP officials after Trump’s order.
“It’s a positive step in depolarizing the issue of refugees,” he said.
Aurora, Colorado, Mayor Mike Coffman, a former GOP congressman, said he expects his city to opt in to the refugee program in a vote Jan. 13. “For those of us who live in communities that are diverse that have experience with refugee populations, it’s an emotional issue. They are one of us.” He said he believes both parties have gone out of their way to polarize the issue, adding “certainly the Trump administration has been a part of that.”
Local business leaders have also argued in favor of resettlement, since many companies rely on refugee labor.
“For me, it is not a political statement; it is a human statement,” Judge Nancy Tanner, the top official in Potter County, Texas, said. “The panhandle of Texas has many refugees working here. Whether it be the cattle industry or the dairy industry, these people add a very important piece to these businesses.”
Tanner did not have a response to the news late Friday that the governor was rejecting refugees.
In the 2016 election, Trump carried Potter County, home to Amarillo and a population of 121,000, with 68 percent of the vote.
Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, who supports curtailing immigration, said communities like the Texas panhandle use the refugees as a backbone for their labor pool.
“The meatpackers have joined hands to funnel cheap, docile labor to these places. So that’s not the community talking, that’s the company talking as a workforce strategy,” he said. “It’s a great deal for meatpackers.”
Sarah Little, the spokesperson for the North American Meat Institute, said her member organizations support the refugee resettlement program. ""They make excellent employees and we have a labor shortage,"" she said.
Krikorian said he thinks the reason that GOP governors are willing to take refugees is because the Trump administration has already drastically cut the total number admitted into the U.S.
In Texas, local officials and 340 evangelical ministers have urged Abbott to keep accepting refugees, So far, the governor has remained silent, and his office did not respond to a request for comment.
The state had hosted more than 2,400 refugees in 2019, more than any other state. Almost half of the Texas refugees in 2019 came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
On Monday, Alaska. Gov. Mike Dunleavy became the 18th GOP governor opting to keep accepting refugees, but he did so quietly. Unlike other governors, Dunleavy did not post his decision on Twitter or in a press release.
A politically charged issue
Almost all 24 Democratic governors have provided consent to take refugees. There are still several other GOP governors who are holding off making a decision.
A spokesperson for Republican Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said she will delay her decision until May, which could mean refugee organizations in Alabama will have to go without federal funding if she consents at a later date.
Choosing to accept or deny refugees has become a charged issue for some GOP governors who have held off making any decision. If the federal judge imposes an injunction before the Jan.21 deadline, the governors may not have to decide one way or the other.
The governors offices in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina are declining to say what they will do, indicating they’re still weighing their options. The governors offices for Vermont and Mississippi did not respond to requests for comment.
Some Republican governors have drawn heat for their choice to support refugees.
Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee has visited refugee camps in Iraq’s Kurdish region and his wife works with refugees in Nashville, according to his spokesperson, so it was not a surprise to his close supporters when he opted in to the program. But this week, he drew criticism at a local meeting for his decision. Lee warned Republicans at the meeting about what he called disinformation efforts by right-wing activists intended to confuse voters.
Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson also faced some backlash for his position. “These are not illegal people, these are not criminals,” Parson told a local talk radio show as he defended his decision to host refugees in the state.
Nationally, conservative commentators such as Tucker Carlson and Michelle Malkin have slammed GOP governors for their willingness to accept refugees.
Ned Ryun, a conservative activist with a group called American Majority, told Carlson on Fox News: “I got to say this as an active devout evangelical Christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with Christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors.”
Other local Republicans said they were blindsided by their governor’s actions.
Trent Garner, a Republican state senator in Arkansas, said he was upset that Gov. Asa Hutchinson chose to make his decision to support refugees during the quiet of the Christmas holiday week.
“There has been a large conversation here in Arkansas in response to the decision and it has been largely negative,” Garner said.
On the local level, only two of the nation’s thousands of local governments have decided to block refugees.
The county government in Appomattox County, Virginia, where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by almost 50 points, voted in December to block refugees.
On Monday, the board of commissioners of Beltrami County in northern Minnesota voted 3 to 2 to block refugees. Trump beat Clinton by 10 points in the county in 2016.
No refugees have been resettled in Beltrami County in the past five years.
In bright-blue Springfield, Massachusetts, the city council voted unanimously to accept refugees, but the Democratic mayor has so far refused to sign the council's resolution. Mayor Domenic Sarno said he has long believed the city has already ""done more than its fair share"" for refugees, and that additional refugees would be an ""unfair burden. He quoted a Boston Federal Reserve report about the city that said, ""You cannot continue to concentrate poverty on top of poverty.""",['blindsided']
"This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-quarantine-protesters-america-form-unholy-covid-19-alliance-ncna1207796,msnbc,vaccines,left,26.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. At recent protests, we’ve seen the intersection of those who doubt the statistics and science behind COVID-19, primarily funded by right-wing groups, shouting alongside the distinctive red, white and black bold-lettered signs that have become the hallmark of anti-vaccine protesters.
This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.
These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message: The virus isn’t a big deal, scientists and the government are lying to you, and you can be a patriot by ignoring fear of the virus and going about your business. Ironically of course, this pandemic highlights exactly why we need vaccines.
This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits. Like anti-vaccine leader Andrew Wakefield, Mikovits pivoted from a legitimate science career to promoting antivaccine propaganda following a retraction of her most notable paper, which appeared in 2009 in the journal Science and suggested that a mouse retrovirus, XMRV, was the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unfortunately, other groups could not replicate Mikovits’s findings, and ultimately even her own lab could not do so when they tried to repeat the research using blinded samples.
Get the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha
In the meantime, Mikovits’s scientific career was already unraveling. A graduate student found an instance where Mikovits had falsified an image used in the XMRV paper. This finding, along with evidence of contamination in the original samples, led to a full retraction of the XMRV paper by Science. Since then, Mikovits has published two books, spinning her career downfall from something of her own doing into a case of martyrdom and mistreatment by “elites” — including Dr. Anthony Fauci. Though she claims in “Plandemic” that “she’s not anti-vaccine” (a common trope of anti-vaxxers), she has filmed interviews wearing a hat for the movie “Vaxxed II” (produced by Andrew Wakefield) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist who has compared vaccines to the Holocaust, promoted her newest book and also wrote its foreword.
In fact, most of the arguments the coronavirus deniers use are very similar to those anti-vaxxers have been pushing for decades. They suggest that scientists and scientific institutions are hopelessly corrupt, that these institutions and individuals are lying to you and only folks like Mikovits are willing to risk it all to tell you ""the truth"": that the government and specifically public health institutions should have no influence over how ordinary Americans live their lives and protect themselves and their communities from disease, and that natural immunity to infection is preferable to vaccines (even though with COVID-19, we are only beginning to learn about immunity and have no idea how long it will last, and how vaccine-induced immunity will compare to that).
Worse, anti-vaccine leaders are already spreading fear about a coronavirus vaccine that does not yet exist; at best, a vaccine is likely a year or more away from release, and they can’t possibly know anything about outcomes of human clinical trials on safety and efficacy at this time. Yet the protesters and amateur health experts are still saying it is dangerous.
While the narrative from many “reopeners” has focused on the economic damage created by lockdowns and closing of restaurants, beauty salons and other service industries, economists have pointed out that even if all of these opened tomorrow, the financial picture will not soon be healed because the virus is still out there, and many people will not yet feel safe participating in public events.
This means those who are most eager to “return to normal” are also those who seem to be least likely to take the steps that would make this possible. Instead of listening to public health experts who have emphasized a program of “test, trace, isolate” to identify new cases, anti-vaccine leaders are instead threatening to track the individuals who have signed up to assist in contact tracing efforts.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, which may help reduce viral transmission, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus,” and that “you’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions.” These claims are nonsensical, but have already made the rounds in anti-vaccine circles, convincing individuals that masks are more dangerous than the virus.
Troublingly, almost 20 percent of Americans currently say they’d be the last to get the vaccine if it was available, or wouldn’t get it at all.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus.""
We just finished a year in which measles cases were higher than they were at any point in the past quarter century. While exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases may be relatively low right now because of distancing measures, the last few months have also seen a decline in children seeing physicians for wellness checks and routine vaccinations, putting children at an increased risk upon reopening. And despite suggestions from President Donald Trump that the virus will go away without a vaccine, we need to be prepared to deal with this epidemic for years rather than months.
Luckily, this is an area where everyone can pitch in to help. If you have friends and family who are hesitant about vaccines, gently discussing with them why you think they are important may help to sway their opinion. If you want to understand why “Plandemic” is such a successful piece of propaganda that even friends and relatives you consider to be “reasonable” are sharing the video, this article will help you see the techniques used by filmmakers to influence individuals, and spot them elsewhere. And if you want a good debunking article to share with those friends, educate yourself. (This article goes through the claims piece by piece.)

The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/how-the-religious-rights-war-against-abortion-is-built-on-lies-grifting-and-bullying/,alternet,abortion,left,26.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Tuesday, both the pro- and anti-choice world were rocked by a revelation that undermines literal decades of religious right nonsense. Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous “conversion” to anti-abortion activism was a con job.
McCorvey told filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, “AKA Jane Roe,” “I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
For pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey’s “conversion” as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don’t want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless “abortion industry.”
McCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was “saved” by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can’t be trusted with autonomy, and need “godly” men to guide them.
(Benham, a supposedly wise and “pro-life” guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among the protesters, clinic staff and the pregnant people seeking care.)
Having spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey’s “conversion” was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped, even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn’t try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn’t seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.
So yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers — nearly half a million dollars over the years — sounds about right.
But the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn’t about McCorvey’s character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire raison d’être is telling lies — often over-the-top, melodramatic lies — in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the “right” of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.
The anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become one big, long con.
The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.
For instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)
To bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice “testimony” is all to often as McCorvey described it: “[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
But this “born alive” mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump’s weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.
The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.
A series of “undercover” videos purporting to “prove” that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling “baby parts” out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would turn out to be bullshit, but too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.
Sure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn’t sell baby parts.” They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research — research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.
This myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest buffer zone around clinics by claiming they were merely “sidewalk counselors” trying to “help” women.
An investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They’re a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.
“If women want careers and education and everything and they don’t want children,” one protester complained to Filipovic, “what are they doing having sex?”
Another complained that “there were no problems” back when women “had to be obedient to their husbands.”
Instead of contraception, a protester argued, “the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”
The court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters merely wished to “counsel” women.
Anti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they’re righteous warriors going up against a sleazy “abortion industry” and trying to “save” women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.
In truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them of their rights and subjugate them both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stands with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny and lurid fantasy.
The press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie will help open up some eyes.
But it’s also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don’t want or can’t bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It’s a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.","['made-up', 'murdering', 'crazed', 'racist', 'liar', 'delicacy', 'anti-choice']"
"When it comes to the Green New Deal blueprint to address the climate crisis, Republicans generally like to pretend it calls for the elimination of hamburgers.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/leading-house-republican-equates-green-new-deal-and-genocide,msnbc,environment,left,26.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"When it comes to the Green New Deal blueprint to address the climate crisis, Republicans generally like to pretend it calls for the elimination of hamburgers. (It does not.) But Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) went quite a bit further this week.
“For many people who live in the West, but also in rural and urban areas, the ideas behind the Green New Deal are tantamount to genocide,” the Republican congressman said at a press conference. “That may be an overstatement, but not by a whole lot.”
A reporter from Axios caught up with Bishop after the event to clarify matters a bit.
AXIOS: Genocide is defined as “the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.” How is the Green New Deal like genocide? BISHOP: I’m an ethnic. I’m a westerner. AXIOS: And you think the Green New Deal is going to kill you? BISHOP: If you actually implement everything they want to. Killing would be positive if you implement everything the Green New Deal actually wants to. That’s why the Green New Deal is not ready for prime time.
For the record, it’s important to emphasize that Rob Bishop isn’t just some random conservative personality, saying odd things in the media. Rather, the Utah Republican is a nine-term Republican – whom GOP leaders named as the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee.
Indeed, up until a few months ago, Bishop chaired the panel, where he spearheaded an effort to invalidate the Endangered Species Act.
And yet, he’ll apparently now be famous for something altogether different.
The Utahan’s argument is a tough one to unpack, since it’s so needlessly over the top. I have some concerns about whether some of the goals set by the Green New Deal are realistic, but to argue that the blueprint is genocidal is hopelessly bonkers.
It’s not homicidal, either. Bishop is apparently under the impression that the proposal would kill him if the plan is “actually implemented,” but that in no way reflects reality.
There’s also the congressman’s claim that he’s “an ethnic,” which is why he believes its responsible to say the Green New Deal is “tantamount to genocide.” I’m at a loss to understand how the GOP lawmaker would even define “ethnic.”
But as the debate over solutions to the climate crisis continues, and the public looks to policymakers to work cooperatively, it’s worth keeping in mind that Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee will be expected to find common ground with Rob Bishop.",['pretend']

But opponents argued that asking minors to negotiate the legal system when they are already scared and ashamed could drive them to illegal abortions.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-legislature-passes-abortion-parental-consent-bill-n1140476?cid=public-rss_20200221,msnbc,abortion,left,26.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Girls under the age of 18 will have to get a parent's permission before having an abortion under a bill passed by the Florida Legislature on Thursday that Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign.
The House voted 75-43 largely along party lines for the legislation that expands a current law that requires a girl's parents are notified before she can have an abortion. DeSantis asked lawmakers to send him the bill during his State of the State speech that kicked off the legislative session last month.
“What we are talking about is a child, and here were are talking about a child who is carrying a child,” said Republican Rep. Erin Grall, who sponsored the bill. “By including parents in this decision we empower the family. It is the critical backbone of our civilized society.”
The debate over the measure lasted nearly four hours.
The bill has a provision that will allow a girl to ask a judge for a waiver from the law in cases of abuse, incest or when involving a parent could cause more harm than allowing the procedure. But opponents argued that asking minors to negotiate the legal system when they are already scared and ashamed could drive them to illegal abortions.

“We are codifying into law that someone else can force a girl to have a child she does not want to have,” Democratic Rep. Susan Valdes said. “I worry that many girls will, when deprived access to a safe termination of pregnancy, take the risks of finding an unsafe, dangerous and untested method of terminating their pregnancies.”
She said that might include searching the internet for “mystery concoctions” in an attempt to end the pregnancy.
Democrats also said some girls might risk being thrown out of their homes or beaten if they tell their parents they're pregnant. But Grall said that just because there are some bad parents, it doesn't mean the rights of others to be part of the decision should be taken away.
“We hear the stories about the bad parent, the human trafficking, the intolerant parent, the abusive parent, the parent who will kill their child. I refuse to accept that we should diminish the rights of all parents in the raising of their children because of the acts of a few,” Grall said.
Republicans argued that children need a parent's permission to go on a school field trip and can't go to an R-rated movie without a parent or guardian, so it makes no sense to make a life-altering decision on their own.
“We require parental consent for a minor to get a driving learner’s permit because it is common sense. It is not common sense to suggest that getting a learner’s permit is a less significant life decision than a child getting an abortion,"" Republican Rep. Ana Maria Rodriguez said. ”A parent guiding their children through major life decisions is a good thing.""
Florida will join 26 other states in requiring that at least one parent give written permission authorizing a doctor to terminate the pregnancy of a minor. Doctors who perform abortions without the parental consent of a girl under 18 would face up to five years in prison for a third-degree felony.
In 1979, the Florida Legislature enacted a similar parental consent law, but it was struck down a decade later by the Florida Supreme Court, which ruled that a woman’s right to privacy extended to pregnant minors. Bill supporters say the constitutional issue has been addressed in the current bill by including the judicial waiver and with a provision that would allow abortions in cases of medical emergencies without parental notification.
Once DeSantis signs the bill, it will become law July 1. It is certain to be challenged in court, but the current makeup off the state Supreme Court is overwhelmingly conservative.","['scared', 'ashamed']"
"Despite a pandemic, one-sided presidential nomination contests, and nationwide protests about police violence and racial equality, the primaries were important — and instructive. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/want-candidates-who-will-reach-beyond-their-base-change-how-we-vote/,alternet,elections-2020,left,27.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Despite a pandemic, one-sided presidential nomination contests, and nationwide protests about police violence and racial equality, the primaries were important — and instructive. First, it was a decided mixed dry run for voting at home in the many states new to major uses of absentee voting. Second, unsafe lines lasting over two hours in the nation’s capital showed we remain challenged with in-person voting as well. We have a lot of work to do ahead of the fall.
We also continue to see misfires based on clinging to a single-choice, plurality vote system. Many candidates won with less than 50 percent support this week, often in races where their party’s dominance means a November cakewalk. When winning takes less votes, it requires less engagement with voters — and it’s far from assured that elected officials will represent their constituents’ values and desires.
For example, look at the results from Indiana. Fifteen congressional primaries were held in the Hoosier state on Tuesday to determine both Democratic and Republican nominees. Eight of the 15 winners “won” with 43 percent of the vote or less. Six victorious candidates moved onto the fall election with a winning percentage in the 30s.
Indiana may have had the most plurality winners, but they were hardly the only state with this issue. Preliminary events show that the new mayor of Baltimore is nearly certain to take office after earning well under a third of the primary vote. In Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Iowa, U.S. House candidates won key races without a majority — indeed, one with under 30 percent in one of the nation’s most competitive districts — as did the Iowa Democrat selected to run against GOP incumbent Joni Ernst this fall.
Now many of these candidates may make fine public servants. And a low winning percentage isn’t their fault: Crowded fields often lead to plurality wins. Many primaries have more than one qualified candidate. Voters should get to choose among many vibrant options. But when a winner earns between 33 and 43 percent of the vote, as more than half of the Indiana victors did this week, that means upwards of two-thirds inside their own party preferred another candidate!
There’s always more legitimacy when a candidate wins a race with 50 percent of the vote. You also end up with a winner that reflects the will of the most people and is more certain to have listened to voters. After all, when candidates know they can win with just a third of the people, they campaign differently. They might focus on turning out their base. They might not bother trying to persuade supporters of another candidate or from another community. And with so many uncompetitive districts — none of Indiana’s nine congressional seats has flipped from one party to the other in nearly a decade — a low-turnout June primary can elevate someone to a safe seat in Congress without having to appeal to more than a third of their own side.
This is one of the reasons why our politics seems so stuck. Not only do we have a hard time talking to each other, the very structure of our elections doesn’t require our politicians to even try. And when you win by turning out the base, why risk appealing to anyone else? A broken system not only elects politicians who need not listen to everyone, it actually incentivizes them to govern that way too.
There is a better way and it’s catching on nationwide. Through the simple means of offering voters to indicate their backup choices in order of preference, ranked choice voting solves the problem of plurality winners. As proven in a growing number of state and city elections, It protects voter choice and ensures that everyone gets to select from a wide array of candidates. But it also pushes candidates to seek votes — be it a first, second or third choice — everywhere, and produces a winner with the widest support from everyone. It works like an instant runoff. Instead of selecting one candidate, voters rank the field in order. The winner is the first candidate to cross 50 percent; if no one does during the first round, then the last place finisher is eliminated and the backup choices come into play.
The true elegance of ranked choice voting is that it encourages candidates to campaign and to govern in an inclusive manner that leads to better representation for everyone. It incentivizes candidates to look beyond their base and seek out second-choice support. When they do that, they learn about new concerns, they develop greater empathy, and they’re able to bring that knowledge to Washington. Too many issues have been ignored for too long, in part because our system allows politicians to ignore too many people in their own districts. Under RCV, reaching out and hearing others suddenly becomes good politics.
It’s not a cure-all. Campaigns are less negative with ranked choice voting, but not without lapses in civility. But our politics needs more listening. It needs greater involvement and the voices of everyone. And we need leaders who are attuned to the concerns of everyone. Better elections would give us a better shot at success.",['one-sided']

"The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-climate-change-philanthropy-has-quite-few-hidden-strings-ncna1143791?cid=public-rss_20200228,msnbc,environment,left,27.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"On Feb. 17, Amazon CEO and occasional richest-man-in-the-world Jeff Bezos announced he was committing $10 billion — 7 to 8 percent of his massive fortune — to an initiative to combat climate change, dubbed the Bezos Earth Fund. Exactly how the funds will be distributed remains to be seen, but Bezos claims money will start flowing this summer in the form of grants to scientists, activists and nonprofit groups for ""any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world."" It's quite a reversal for the billionaire, who once declared, ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.""
Bezos' change of heart aligns him with other powerful people. Last year, former Republican New York mayor and current candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Mike Bloomberg pledged $500 million to shut down coal plants across the United States. Goldman Sachs, the reviled investment bank, said it will invest $750 billion in ""sustainable finance projects"" over 10 years. And earlier this month, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has around $47 billion in its ever-growing endowment, added climate change to its philanthropic priorities.
It might seem that having wealthy individuals and multinational corporations promising so much money for climate initiatives would be a good thing. But it's much more complicated than just rich people trying to make the planet a better place. Anand Giridharadas, author of ""Winner Takes All,"" has emerged as one of the chief critics of this recent spate of billionaire philanthropy. Giridharadas writes that for all their talk of changing the world through charitable giving, what elites offer is a ""fake change"" that seeks ""to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix — and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.""

In practice, that means it's hard to trust Bezos' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal. Its push for ever-faster delivery times, as little as one to two days in parts of the country, also comes with an environmental cost.
Then there's the bigger question of why philanthropists are suddenly focusing on the environment. Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action. In the United States, President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, rolled back plenty of environmental regulations and opened Alaska's wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, among other backward measures, but even officials at the lower levels of government aren't doing enough.
Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors is that government has failed to take bold action.
But U.S. officials are far from the only offenders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got some good press for implementing a carbon tax, but his government isn't on track to meet its Paris targets, either. Canada also nationalized a pipeline that would increase emissions and facilitate an expansion of Alberta's oil sands, and it is still dealing with crippling rail blockades after federal police forced indigenous land defenders out of the way of yet another pipeline. Meanwhile, politicians in Australia's right-wing government continue to oppose climate action, even in the face of record fires, and the European Union is funding new gas projects despite declaring a climate emergency.
But this lack of vision is not inherent to the public sphere. Rather, Giridharadas argues, it's the product of a broken system captured by notions of ""business fundamentalism"" and ""market worship,"" in which even those in the public sector believe that the capitalist class must chart the path forward. This is largely the product of a mindset promoted by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and brought into the Democratic Party by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which devalues the role of government in favor of the private sector.
In 2019, the 500 richest people in the world increased their wealth by $1.2 trillion, an increase of 25 percent in a single year. Also relevant: The richest 10 percent of people worldwide are responsible for nearly half of global emissions. Yet the tax rate paid by American billionaires fell below that of the working class in 2018 — and all their philanthropy actually reduces the tax they pay. Amazon, one of the most valuable companies in the world, paid no federal tax in 2018, instead receiving a $129 million tax refund.
That transfer of wealth has limited the ability of government to respond to social problems while increasing the economic power of billionaires. To some, that may seem like a good thing — we've been told for decades that the private sector is more efficient. But as Giridharadas says: ""There is enormous moral difference between five guys deciding to do something and a city deciding to do something. This is something I think you wouldn't have had to explain to people 100 years or 200 years ago when we actually had more faith in the idea of democratic action."" By leaving so much to billionaires, democracy is eroded.
The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations. In the past, large-scale social and economic transformations have always required government action, whether it was $500 billion to build the Interstate highway system, the creation of the Federal Housing Authority to subsidize homeownership and the suburbanization of the country or, as Sen. Bernie Sanders talked about recently at CNN's Nevada town hall, the restructuring of the U.S. economy to defeat fascism in World War II. These kinds of massive structural changes could not be accomplished by the private sector alone; Bezos' $10 billion wouldn't even cover the cost of New York City's Second Avenue Subway line, let alone a large-scale transformation of the entire country.
This is because, as Giridharadas writes, ""changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up."" That something is the power and wealth billionaires have derived from an economy that privileges growth at all costs and has caused inequality to soar and accelerated the climate crisis. But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society. They profit from the world as it is, not as it could be.
That's why billionaires' donations will never be enough. The highways, the suburbs and the victory against the Nazis — just to provide a few examples — are products not of the private sector but of government action. Through state spending, regulatory powers and the tax code, the government set the framework and priorities that businesses then responded to — and if we have any hope of cutting emissions in half by 2030, as the scientists tell us we need to do, we'll need the government to use its power to reset the rules once again.
The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place. For that, we need the government to redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, change the tax code to penalize unsustainable industries, alter regulations to encourage denser development and ultimately set a framework that's more favorable to workers and communities that have been left behind these past few decades. That's why, regardless of what billionaires do, we need a Green New Deal to chart the path forward.","['billionaire', 'philanthropy']"

Over the past 10 years it has come to light—through numerous lawsuits and state and federal investigations—that untold billions of dollars has been swindled out of student and taxpayers’ pockets by this private educational company. Earlier this year the Obama administration forgave almost half a billion dollars in federal student loans that were fraudulently acquired and today it’s being reported that further cancelations of federal student loans are coming.
The move marks the first recent use of a little-utilized provision in federal law that gives student debtors the right to petition the Education Department to discharge their debt in cases where they were defrauded into taking out loans. The debt forgiveness plan only affects 1 percent of the roughly 125,000 student debtors who are eligible for expedited debt cancellation. That comes to about 2 percent of the students' nearly $1.3 billion in combined loan balances. The department said in June and November that those borrowers were eligible for immediate loan relief after determining that Corinthian had likely defrauded the former students by advertising false job placement rates.
The move is symbolic at best right now. As the Huffington Post points out, Massachusetts is being pressured to do six times that number in their state alone.
The department had received fewer than 6,700 applications as of Nov. 18, according to its report. By comparison, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on Nov. 30 urged Duncan to cancel debts owed by about 7,200 borrowers who attended Corinthian’s schools in her state alone. She sent the department 2,700 pages of confidential evidence from her investigation into Corinthian’s alleged frauds and attestations from former Corinthian students to support their claims for relief. “The department funneled billions of dollars to executives and shareholders of these fraudulent ‘schools’ for over a decade,"" said the Debt Collective, a group of activists who have helped organize hundreds of allegedly defrauded student debtors to stop making payments on their loans, in a statement. ""It now wants to save face by creating a Rube Goldberg-type contraption to prevent as many people as possible from seeking the relief they deserve.""
The criticisms of the administration are far from unwarranted as just last month another private educational organization, Educational Management Corporation, settled with the Justice Department for a reported $95.5 million dollars—a far cry from the billions they ripped off. Still, as slowly and inefficiently as things are running, they are running in a correct general direction. There needs to be better outreach to the eligible borrowers concerning their debt relief.","['criminal', 'swindled', 'boatload']"

And his demagoguery around the Central American immigrant caravans and asylum-seekers continually obscure the fact that asking for asylum is an entirely legal form of immigration — even though Trump and his defenders now like to call it a “loophole.”,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/the-trump-administration-keeps-revealing-its-bigotry-against-immigration-even-if-its-legal/,alternet,immigration,left,28.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"One of the biggest lies told by many opponents of immigration is that they only stand against “illegal” immigration, while they fully support “legal” immigration. This line has been said repeatedly by defenders of President Donald Trump — I have frequently been scolded by readers who are unhappy with my characterization of him as “anti-immigrant.”
But this framing is fundamentally misleading because many Americans will assume that a given immigrant isn’t in the country legally based on racial and economic stereotypes, as suggested by a recent survey from Washington University.
And the Trump administration, like so many other opponents of immigration, has repeatedly made it clear that it hopes to reduce legal immigration to the United States. For example, the administration confirmed Tuesday that it is considering closing down 21 international offices of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which, as PBS NewsHour reporter Yamiche Alcindor explained, “could slow the processing of family visa applications.”
Vox reporter Dara Lind also pointed out that the new Trump budget released this week would hike fees on immigration application fees in the name of “deficit reduction,” though it would only raise an estimated $500 million over ten years.
“Half a billion dollars a year doesn’t do much to mitigate a projected $900 billion-and-growing deficit, which soared after the federal government passed a tax cut bill in 2017 (and did not reduce spending to meet it),” wrote Lind. “But to immigrants who already have to pay several hundred dollars for an application — and who often have to file multiple applications, to renew their immigration status or become green card holders or citizens — it’s an added burden.”
Of course, Trump already let the mask slip on his antipathy to legal immigration when he backed the “RAISE Act,” which would have cut legal immigration by about 50 percent. And his demagoguery around the Central American immigrant caravans and asylum-seekers continually obscure the fact that asking for asylum is an entirely legal form of immigration — even though Trump and his defenders now like to call it a “loophole.”
But in his 2019 State of the Union, Trump spooked some of his most fervent anti-immigrant supporters when he said, “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
As I said then, though, this was a clear lie. Nothing he’s done as president indicates an effort to increase legal immigration — which would, in theory, be quite easy to do. Trump’s record makes it obvious that he will work to limit even legal immigration — and his administration’s actions continue to bolster that conclusion. But the fact that he cloaks this fact by stoking false fears about immigrant crime and delivering rage-filled rants about “illegal” immigration shows that this isn’t some genuine and reasoned policy view about the costs and benefits of new entrants to the labor force — it’s a reactionary stance built atop anti-immigrant bigotry.","['demagoguery', 'obscure']"

Drowned out by the algorithm: Vaccination advocates struggle to be heard online,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/drowned-out-algorithm-pro-vaccination-advocates-struggle-be-heard-online-n976321,msnbc,vaccines,left,28.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"In 2008, Vaccinate Your Family, the nation’s largest nonprofit dedicated to advocating for vaccinations, had to stop posting videos to YouTube.
Then known as Every Child By Two, the organization had used its channel on the massive video platform to post interviews with doctors, public service announcements and testimonials from parents of children who had died of vaccine-preventable diseases.
But those messages were quickly sabotaged. YouTube’s recommendation system, which appears alongside videos and suggests what users should watch next, would direct viewers to anti-vaccination videos, according to Amy Pisani, executive director of Vaccinate Your Family.
“When we would put things on YouTube, it was followed by an anti-vaccination video,” Pisani told NBC News. YouTube’s recommendation system, powered by an algorithm that the company does not make public, has been criticized in recent years for favoring controversial and conspiratorial content. The company has said that it changed the system to point to more “authoritative” sources.
“They were insane. Videos like ‘My child was harmed by the DTaP’ or ‘My child can’t walk anymore,’ every conspiracy that you can imagine would come after ours,” Pisani said. ""They actually started running right after our video was over, so if you blinked for a minute, you wouldn’t know it was a new video.”
“We became so frustrated with the recommendations that we moved them to Vimeo,” a far smaller YouTube-like video platform owned by media conglomerate InterActiveCorp, Pisani said. YouTube has more than 10 times Vimeo’s active users and is the second-largest search engine in the world after Google, which also owns YouTube.
Pisani’s story offers a window into the struggle that public health officials and advocates face as they attempt to provide information on vaccinations on social media, where anti-vaccination proponents have spent more than a decade building audiences and developing strategies that ensure they appear high in search results and automated recommendations.
The anti-vaccination community holds to an unscientific conspiracy theory that childhood vaccinations are toxic and cause numerous illnesses and injuries, including autism, and spreads these beliefs through YouTube, Facebook and other online platforms. The widespread prevalence of this misinformation on the platforms has caused some parents to withhold or delay vaccinations, leading to an increase in the spread of preventable diseases, most recently a measles outbreak in the Pacific Northwest that, as of Sunday, had infected 70 people — mostly unvaccinated children.
The World Health Organization included vaccine hesitancy in its list of top 10 threats to global health this year. Though limited, recent research suggests part of the solution to the public health crisis might be found on the same platforms that allowed vaccine myths to spread. A 2017 study published in the journal Pediatrics found that a random sampling of pregnant women who interacted with responsible vaccine information on social media were more likely to vaccinate their babies on time.
“The public understanding of science has shifted dramatically by people moving from Google search into social media to get information about vaccines or any health information,” said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center. “And this is to their detriment.”
While a valuable resource for asking questions and having discussions, social media has also opened up traps for the everyday user who may not have been susceptible to anti-vaccination theories before visiting a social media group, Donovan said.
“The opportunity has turned into a threat,” Donovan said. “Anti-vaxxers look for ‘momversation’ groups. Because they know that new parents are usually novices who haven’t thought a lot about vaccines and are very susceptible to scientific jargon because they don’t have the information literacy to sort through the rest of the internet.”
Donovan said the source of the unvetted, unscientific information surrounding vaccines isn’t just coming from oversharing parents, but often from highly motivated “snake oil salesmen,” peddling books, merchandise, and “natural cures” to vaccinate preventable illnesses.
“You have your hard-liner true believers pushing anti-vaccine information out of a real anti-scientific belief system, but then you have a whole group of other people who are monetizing it and are selling products with a marketing scheme to ‘take down big pharma,’” Donovan said.
After more than a decade and facing mounting pressure, YouTube announced a change in its recommendation algorithm this month, saying it would stop suggesting conspiracy videos like the ones that followed Vaccinate Your Family’s. YouTube also stopped some anti-vaccine videos from showing ads and earning money, and started providing more information about the threat of vaccine hesitancy in a window below anti-vaccine videos.

In a statement to NBC News, a YouTube spokesman called misinformation around medical topics “a difficult challenge,” and referred to their recent policy changes, adding, “like many algorithmic changes, these efforts will be gradual and will get more and more accurate over time.”
Pinterest has suppressed all search results on vaccines while the site figures out a solution. And Facebook — which recommends anti-vaccination groups, and allows anti-vaccination groups to target pregnant woman and mothers in paid advertising — has said it “is working” on unspecified changes in regards to health-related misinformation.
It’s all welcome progress, Pisani says, but she believes the damage has been done.
“We used to do so many helpful, wonderful things,” like helping parents who couldn’t afford vaccines and educating doctors on barriers to access, she said. “Now we spend most of our time dealing with the misinformation out there. It’s a constant battle.”
And on social media, the anti-vaccination proponents seem to be winning.
Vaccinate Your Family’s Facebook page has nearly 200,000 likes and followers, but nowhere near the visibility or engagement of anti-vaccine pages and private groups, where hundreds of thousands of users post articles from fringe health websites, trade tips on avoiding state-mandated vaccinations, and share memes bashing parents who vaccinate.
“Anti-vaccination groups are much more successful at using the interactive features of social media than places where we might typically get health advice,” said Naomi Smith, a lecturer at Federation University Australia who has studied the anti-vaccination movement on Facebook. “So pro-vaccination pages either serve as information repositories or they debunk anti-vaccination claims, neither of which get to the emotional core of anti-vaccination attitudes.”
Those attitudes are often grounded in parental concern, Smith said.
“Additionally, we have to remember that these groups usually don’t call themselves anti-vaccine, they might be ‘pro-safe vaccines’ or ‘in favor of vaccine choice,’” she said. “They appeal to parents’ protective instincts, and really tap into the genuine pain caused by childhood illness and death, which seemingly lack an adequate medical explanation.”
The National Vaccine Information Center, a misleadingly legitimate-sounding organization with 213,000 likes on Facebook, has urged parents not to vaccinate their children since the 1980s. Stop Mandatory Vaccination, one of the largest anti-vaccination pages with 127,000 likes, is run by a social media activist who crowdfunds to advertise his messages to pregnant women on Facebook.
Though Vaccinate Your Family has more Facebook followers than Stop Mandatory Vaccination, the anti-vaccine content travels much further. In the last two years, articles from Stop Mandatory Vaccination’s website were shared on Facebook more than a million times, according to the social media analysis tool BuzzSumo. Vaccinate Your Family’s content was shared just over 1,000 times.
Larry Cook, the self-described social media activist behind Stop Mandatory Vaccination, described the reason behind the disparity, telling BuzzFeed News, ""The hardcore pro-vaccine advocates do not create content, Page and Groups, that attract large followers to Facebook since that line of thinking is already the common conversation and agreement in mainstream media and the public eye.”
Pisani said they’re trying.
“The people on our page are really engaged,” Pisani said. “It’s been really impressive. Of course we get a lot of pushback. We’ll put out a post and get the same people making the same ridiculous claims.”
“Everyone has questions about vaccines,” Pisani said. “We’re polite to people who have questions. We’re not in their face and we never never argue with anti-vaxxers. We just want to get to those people before they get swooped into the nonsense.”
Some amateur vaccine advocates are more than willing to enter the fray.
Stephan Neidenbach, 38, a middle-school technology teacher from Annapolis, Maryland, runs “We Love GMOs and Vaccines,” a Facebook page he started in 2014, he said, to combat growing misinformation on Facebook.
At first Neidenbach said he was just anonymously replying to anti-vaccine content, but soon scientists, farmers and doctors started following the page and sharing.
The page — now with with 194,000 followers — is one of several on Facebook that respond directly and in-kind to anti-vaccination pages. Users share news reports about vaccine outbreaks, and post memes and screenshots of posts from anti-vaccine groups, which they ridicule in the comments.
One recent post read, “If you're antivaxx and you see me making fun of antivaxx people, I just want to say that I am talking about you personally and I hope you're offended because you're f------ stupid.”
“That’s what separates me from other organizations,” Neidenbach said. “I’m not an organization, and I’m not trying to run a nonprofit. I’m just a school teacher. And I don’t have to be as nice as I do in the classroom.”
“They have to worry about being professional,” he said. “But we can do more inflammatory stuff that the World Health organization can’t do. And the inflammatory stuff, as you can tell by the anti-vaxxers, does well on Facebook.”
“I’d love to find someone with more of a medical or scientific background to take it over, but I haven’t found anyone yet who wants to. I guess most scientists and doctors don’t have the time to do this on the side. For now, it doesn’t take much effort.”
As platforms take steps to address the spread of anti-vaccine content, Pisani is hoping that Facebook and others will promote Vaccinate Your Family’s reputable content — even if past attempts to work together have been unsuccessful.
Pisani said former first lady Rosalynn Carter, a co-founder of Vaccinate Your Family, wrote a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2016 on behalf of the organization, after Zuckerberg posted a photo of himself with his infant daughter with the caption, “Doctor's visit — time for vaccines!”
“We wanted to work with him and his wife to talk about other ways to promote vaccines,” Pisano said. “We didn’t ask him to fix the internet, or Facebook.”
They didn’t receive a reply.","['Drowned', 'out', 'struggle']"

"Women’s rights advocates were relieved late Monday when Senate Democrats blocked an extreme anti-choice bill from advancing to a floor debate—but were soon outraged by President Donald Trump’s lies about abortion care, as well as the corporate media for enabling his blatantly false characterization of the bill to stand.",https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/598963036/0/alternet_all~Here%e2%80%99s-why-corporate-media-is-%e2%80%98culpable%e2%80%99-for-bolstering-Trump%e2%80%99s-abortion-lies/,alternet,abortion,left,28.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Women’s rights advocates were relieved late Monday when Senate Democrats blocked an extreme anti-choice bill from advancing to a floor debate—but were soon outraged by President Donald Trump’s lies about abortion care, as well as the corporate media for enabling his blatantly false characterization of the bill to stand.
After Senate Republicans failed to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to push through the so-called “Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,” introduced by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Trump attacked Democrats for their rejection of a bill that would punish doctors for providing medical care to pregnant women and allow civil action against women themselves for making an often-painful, life-or-death decision about their health and family.
“Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth.”
Sasse’s proposal would require doctors to provide medical care to an infant after a late-term abortion, exercising “the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child” as he or she would for a healthy newborn baby.
The Republicans’ narrative on late-term abortions has suggested that doctors, with the aim of “executing babies,” routinely perform the procedure in the third trimester of pregnancy on women who are pregnant with healthy, viable babies and have simply decided several months into their pregnancies that they no longer wish to have a child.
In fact, only 1.3 percent of abortions happen after 21 weeks of pregnancy, and according to the National Abortion Federation, they are “generally limited to cases of severe fetal abnormalities or situations when the life or health of the pregnant woman is seriously threatened.”
As NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue explained on Twitter, Trump’s statement—and Sasse’s claim that the bill is anti-“infanticide”—wildly misrepresent that facts about the legislation.
Heads up: There is literally nothing about this tweet that reflects any version of reality. https://t.co/W62MVJnPWf — ilyse hogue (@ilyseh) February 26, 2019
If ANYONE is killing infants, they are murderers and they are charged with murder. That is what everyone agrees should happen and that is, in fact, what happens. — ilyse hogue (@ilyseh) February 26, 2019
The @BenSasse bill was designed to be a part of Trump’s playbook (as an aside: remember when Sasse said he was different from Trump? not so much) to use fake boogeymen (remember the caravan?) to play to people’s basest instincts and scare them into hating anyone other than Trump. — ilyse hogue (@ilyseh) February 26, 2019
The bill was introduced weeks after Democratic state lawmaker Kathy Tran of Virginia was denounced by Republicans including the president for proposing an amendment to her state’s current law allowing third-trimester abortions—permitting the procedure if carrying a pregnancy to term would damage a woman’s health in any way.
Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called Sasse’s proposal “clearly anti-doctor, anti-woman and anti-family,” with other Democrats joining her in condemning the bill.

On social media, Hogue also blamed the corporate media for permitting Trump’s lies to frame the national discussion on the procedure, with the Washington Post headliningtheir story on the bill, “Senate Blocks Bill on Medical Care for Children Born Alive After Attempted Abortion.” The headline by U.S. News & World Report also fell for the GOP’s gimmick:“Dems Block Senate GOP Bill on Infants Surviving Abortions.”
“The media is culpable with headlines like this one from the Washington Post,” Hogue wrote, “which would require about 20 minutes of googling to understand how misinformed that frame is.”

"After tremendous pressure on the Department of Homeland Security, Miller is advancing his agenda of not just blocking migrants from entering the country illegally, but making life in the U.S. so unbearable for legal immigrants that they leave the country.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/top-trump-white-nationalist-stephen-miller-just-won-a-major-battle-against-legal-immigrants/,alternet,immigration,left,29.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller has just won a major battle against immigrants in the United States – legal immigrants. After tremendous pressure on the Department of Homeland Security, Miller is advancing his agenda of not just blocking migrants from entering the country illegally, but making life in the U.S. so unbearable for legal immigrants that they leave the country.
The AP calls it one of the Trump administration’s “most aggressive efforts to restrict legal immigration.”
Under a new rule the Dept. of Homeland Security will begin in October to deny green cards to immigrants who have ever used taxpayer-funded assistance, such as food stamps, Medicaid, health care, prescription drug subsidies, or Section 8 housing vouchers. Additionally, the rule allows DHS to deny green cards to any immigrant who cannot prove in the future they would not access government benefits, as NBC News reports.
Miller, who has been credibly called a white nationalist, pressured DHS to pass the new rule – called a “public charge” regulation – and do it quickly. The new rule would allow the Trump administration to reinterpret a 1999 law to specify what government assistance programs can or can not be used by immigrants.
Politico earlier this month published a report after having obtained emails that “shed new light on how aggressively Miller has pressured the Department of Homeland Security to move faster on regulations to limit immigration. Critics say the new rule will be used to shore up Trump’s political base in the coming election year, and that it’s an illegitimate tool to reduce legal immigration.”
Miller wrote in April that the “timeline on public charge is unacceptable.”
“The public charge reg has been in the works for a year and a half. This is time we don’t have. I don’t care what you need to do to finish it on time. You run an agency of 20,000 people.”
“It’s an embarrassment that we’ve been here for 18 months and USCIS hasn’t published a single major reg,” Miller barked.
Studies show some immigrants who do not fully understand the new rule will choose to un-enroll from vital government assistance programs in the hope of protecting their immigration status. That means taking food, health care, and housing away from families, including those with young children.","['agenda', 'unbearable', 'tremendous']"
Coronavirus vaccine and quarantine protesters in America form an unholy COVID-19 alliance.,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-quarantine-protesters-america-form-unholy-covid-19-alliance-ncna1207796,msnbc,vaccines,left,29.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. At recent protests, we’ve seen the intersection of those who doubt the statistics and science behind COVID-19, primarily funded by right-wing groups, shouting alongside the distinctive red, white and black bold-lettered signs that have become the hallmark of anti-vaccine protesters.
This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.
These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message: The virus isn’t a big deal, scientists and the government are lying to you, and you can be a patriot by ignoring fear of the virus and going about your business. Ironically of course, this pandemic highlights exactly why we need vaccines.
This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits. Like anti-vaccine leader Andrew Wakefield, Mikovits pivoted from a legitimate science career to promoting antivaccine propaganda following a retraction of her most notable paper, which appeared in 2009 in the journal Science and suggested that a mouse retrovirus, XMRV, was the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unfortunately, other groups could not replicate Mikovits’s findings, and ultimately even her own lab could not do so when they tried to repeat the research using blinded samples.
Get the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha
In the meantime, Mikovits’s scientific career was already unraveling. A graduate student found an instance where Mikovits had falsified an image used in the XMRV paper. This finding, along with evidence of contamination in the original samples, led to a full retraction of the XMRV paper by Science. Since then, Mikovits has published two books, spinning her career downfall from something of her own doing into a case of martyrdom and mistreatment by “elites” — including Dr. Anthony Fauci. Though she claims in “Plandemic” that “she’s not anti-vaccine” (a common trope of anti-vaxxers), she has filmed interviews wearing a hat for the movie “Vaxxed II” (produced by Andrew Wakefield) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist who has compared vaccines to the Holocaust, promoted her newest book and also wrote its foreword.
In fact, most of the arguments the coronavirus deniers use are very similar to those anti-vaxxers have been pushing for decades. They suggest that scientists and scientific institutions are hopelessly corrupt, that these institutions and individuals are lying to you and only folks like Mikovits are willing to risk it all to tell you ""the truth"": that the government and specifically public health institutions should have no influence over how ordinary Americans live their lives and protect themselves and their communities from disease, and that natural immunity to infection is preferable to vaccines (even though with COVID-19, we are only beginning to learn about immunity and have no idea how long it will last, and how vaccine-induced immunity will compare to that).
Worse, anti-vaccine leaders are already spreading fear about a coronavirus vaccine that does not yet exist; at best, a vaccine is likely a year or more away from release, and they can’t possibly know anything about outcomes of human clinical trials on safety and efficacy at this time. Yet the protesters and amateur health experts are still saying it is dangerous.
While the narrative from many “reopeners” has focused on the economic damage created by lockdowns and closing of restaurants, beauty salons and other service industries, economists have pointed out that even if all of these opened tomorrow, the financial picture will not soon be healed because the virus is still out there, and many people will not yet feel safe participating in public events.
This means those who are most eager to “return to normal” are also those who seem to be least likely to take the steps that would make this possible. Instead of listening to public health experts who have emphasized a program of “test, trace, isolate” to identify new cases, anti-vaccine leaders are instead threatening to track the individuals who have signed up to assist in contact tracing efforts.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, which may help reduce viral transmission, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus,” and that “you’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions.” These claims are nonsensical, but have already made the rounds in anti-vaccine circles, convincing individuals that masks are more dangerous than the virus.
Troublingly, almost 20 percent of Americans currently say they’d be the last to get the vaccine if it was available, or wouldn’t get it at all.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus.""
We just finished a year in which measles cases were higher than they were at any point in the past quarter century. While exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases may be relatively low right now because of distancing measures, the last few months have also seen a decline in children seeing physicians for wellness checks and routine vaccinations, putting children at an increased risk upon reopening. And despite suggestions from President Donald Trump that the virus will go away without a vaccine, we need to be prepared to deal with this epidemic for years rather than months.
Luckily, this is an area where everyone can pitch in to help. If you have friends and family who are hesitant about vaccines, gently discussing with them why you think they are important may help to sway their opinion. If you want to understand why “Plandemic” is such a successful piece of propaganda that even friends and relatives you consider to be “reasonable” are sharing the video, this article will help you see the techniques used by filmmakers to influence individuals, and spot them elsewhere.

"In the case of student debt cancellation, they also force people to make painful choices: Does a young couple put off getting married to get their student debt reduced? Do they wait another year before taking good jobs, so that they qualify? Must a struggling young person stay away from his parents’ home and couch-surf for a year to obtain the benefit?",https://www.alternet.org/2019/06/bernie-got-it-right-full-student-debt-cancellation-is-the-best-approach/,alternet,student-debt,left,30.0,3.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, together with Representatives Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal, has introduced a dramatic reform package on college affordability. It goes far beyond anything proposed so far, both in its scope and in its potential to reshape the way Americans think about their society and government.
One bill in the package, Rep. Omar’s Student Debt Cancellation Act, would cancel all outstanding student debt. That’s a $1.6 trillion burden affecting more than 45 million people. This bill will benefit people in all demographic groups, communities, and walks of life. That fact is illustrated by the fact that, as Sen. Sanders introduces the bill in the Senate, eight representatives of color (including Rep. Omar) will simultaneously introduce it in the House.
The reform package also includes Sen. Sanders’ College for All Act, which provides tuition-free higher education to every qualified American without any additional work requirements, restrictions, or tests for family financial eligibility.
An Unfair Deal
Both ideas are transformative. But, of the two proposals, it is student debt cancellation that’s likely to trigger the most vigorous debate. That’s a good thing, because it can lead to both a teaching moment and an opportunity for reflection.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for partial student debt cancellation began a productive national conversation. But the Omar/Sanders proposal, with its full and universal cancellation for tens of millions of people trapped by student debt, gives us an opportunity: to re-examine our social contract, our awareness of the public good, and our fundamental ideas about equity and fairness.
Some people’s first response to the idea of canceling all student debt is to think that it’s a step too far. Why not just cancel part of the debt, for some of the debt holders, as Sen. Warren’s proposal does? Freedom to Prosper, an activist group that was instrumental in laying the groundwork for full debt cancellation*, offers useful data and analysis on the benefits of full cancellation on its website.
But the most important argument for full cancellation is a moral one. Low-cost or tuition-free higher education was available for many years in the United States, in many parts of the country. A series of public policy choices shifted this cost onto individual students, who were promised that their “investment” would pay off in higher earnings.
Neither the policy change nor the promise was fair to students or their families. It was wrong to shift society’s shared responsibility of educating its citizens onto individuals. And it was wrong to make them a promise that, as we now know, never came true. As Julie Margetta Morgan and Marshall Steinbaum wrote for the Roosevelt Institute, “More education has not led to higher earnings over time.”
A Plan for Everyone
President Obama put it well in his final State of the Union address when he said, “No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.” Partial cancellation would leave millions trapped in the red for the foreseeable future.
Some people have expressed concern that full cancellation could reward wealthier—and whiter—people, who are less in need than others. But full cancellation will reduce the racial wealth gap. Economist Marshall Steinbaum concluded that the elimination of all student debt would reduce that gap in younger households from a 12:1 advantage for whites to 5:1—a ratio that is still unconscionably and immorally high, and must be addressed by other policies. But this figure shows that full cancellation lessens the harm. When taken as a whole, this college affordability reform package is likely to significantly improve racial injustice in our economy.
In that case, why not target the program to lower-income people, as Warren’s plan would? First, because truly wealthy people don’t generally have student debt. They write checks for college tuition. If they become wealthy after graduation, their financial advisers will almost certainly tell them to pay off student debt in full. After all, student debt terms are far less favorable than those available to “high net worth individuals.”
Why cancel debt for everyone? First, because many of us have long believed those things we hold most precious—our parks, our security, and our access to knowledge—should be freely available to all. These borrowers were denied that access. That’s an historical injustice we should make right.
Secondly, everyone who holds student debt has been wronged by our country’s shift away from tuition-free public education, and by the false promises that accompanied that shift.
Making it right will benefit more than the 45 million borrowers and their families. A report from the Levy Institute showed that full student debt cancellation will create more than a million jobs, and significant economic growth, over a period of several years.
That number becomes considerably smaller, by hundreds of thousands of jobs, under a limited plan like Sen. Warren’s. In effect, the limited program deprives thousands of blue-collar Americans of jobs they would otherwise have under full cancellation. That’s a price they shouldn’t have to pay, especially if it’s motivated by an exaggerated fear that somehow, somewhere, a well-to-do orthodontist is getting a break she doesn’t deserve.
The Policy and the Politics
The politics of this issue are compelling. Polling on full cancellation is surprisingly strong, as seen in a recent survey conducted by Data for Progress (DFP) and published by Freedom to Prosper. And full cancellation, of the kind proposed by Rep. Omar and Sen. Sanders, helps more people. In general, the broader the population affected by policies—in this case, by full cancellation and tuition-free higher education—the larger the “army” willing to fight for them.
These proposals also benefit from their simplicity. Democrats, as is well known, tend to over-engineer their policies. They make you, in the words of an old Godfather joke, an offer you can’t understand.
In the case of student debt cancellation, they also force people to make painful choices: Does a young couple put off getting married to get their student debt reduced? Do they wait another year before taking good jobs, so that they qualify? Must a struggling young person stay away from his parents’ home and couch-surf for a year to obtain the benefit?
Conclusion
The clear and simple structure of this plan will make it easier to explain to the public. It will help more people, and it will help them more thoroughly. And it will give progressives the opportunity to remind Americans of a time when the country understood the value of the public good—when it was understood that the government looked to unite society through common investment in, and benefit from, publicly provided goods and services.
There may be pushback among Democrats. If so, I hope the ones doing the pushing will reconsider. We have treated our younger generations, and many older people, unjustly. The act of recognizing an injustice we hadn’t seen before makes us more human and refines us as moral beings.
This moral context, along with the inexorable mathematics of social and economic justice, makes the Omar/Sanders bill an important and profound proposal that deserves broad support.

"Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/why-trump-is-so-eager-to-bring-back-professional-sports/,alternet,sport,left,30.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"As controversies about the “reopening” of America loom over our lives, nothing seems as intrinsically irrelevant — yet possibly as critically important — as how soon major spectator sports return.
If sports don’t trump religion as the opiate of the masses, they have, until recently, been at least the background music of most of our lives. So here’s my bet on one possible side effect of the Covid-19 pandemic to put in your scorebook: if the National Football League plays regular season games this fall, President Trump stands a good chance of winning reelection for returning America to business as usual — or, at least, to his twisted version of the same.
That’s why he announced at a recent daily coronavirus briefing-cum-rally his eagerness to bring professional sports back quickly. Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old” — the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.
Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season — already poisoned by last year’s Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal — is up for grabs. Certainly, the proposed plan to turn stadiums in the Phoenix, Arizona, area into the sports equivalent of a vast movie set for the games of all 30 major league teams (to be played without fans) seems far-fetched at best.
But football, now the true national pastime, is another matter.
In sports terms, as in so much else in coronaviral America, these are desperately deprived times, even for casual fans. There will be intense pressure — and not only from the president’s base — for that sport’s return. For many people, mostly men, it’s the sustaining soap opera that has always carried them into the next week and the one after that, a porn-ish escape hatch from work and family, a currency of communication with other men, an eternal connection to a non-demanding hive.
Games for Lives?
Without professional (or even college) sports right now or realistically in the near future, fans feel even more unmoored in lives that, for all of us, are distinctly adrift. As they become edgier, it’s a reasonable bet (or at least my hope) that they will also become more open to questioning Trump’s mismanagement — or, to put it more bluntly, sacrifice — of their lives. Recent polls already seem to reflect this, with the latest Gallup Poll showing the steepest approval decline of his presidency.
The president, I suspect, fears just this, though perhaps, in the end, the hole in everyday life where sports once was may only reinforce fans’ sense (like the president’s) that the games are too important not to bring back, safety be damned. Certainly, Trump and other Republican politicians have already been willing enough to forfeit lives to boost their reelection chances.
The values and sensibilities of football are, of course, Trumpist in nature. That’s why former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s demonstration against racism — performed in a kind of public isolation — elicited such a harsh reaction from the president in the now-distant pre-pandemic era. That’s why the sport’s billionaire owners, predominantly Trump donors, shunned Kaepernick (although some of their teams could have used his skills). They didn’t dare to, or care to, give him another platform, not in an era when “president” and “racism” were becoming synonymous.
Even more tellingly, in an understandable but still disappointing me-first display, few of Kaepernick’s fellow players, most of whom are also African-American, supported him publicly. After years of being celebrated as America’s “warriors” and “role models,” they came up desperately short when it counted. Compare them to healthcare workers and other front-line heroes of this pandemic and you’ll realize just how far short they fell of even the most modest form of everyday bravery.
Not that, when it comes to pro sports, football was such an outlier. As activism goes, baseball, a sport that once produced transcendent progressive heroes like Jackie Robinson, Jim Bouton, and Curt Flood, has been eerily quiet in recent years. It’s a sport that the president has paid relatively little attention to — except for suggesting recently that Pete Rose, banned from baseball for life for betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was that team’s manager, should be allowed into its Hall of Fame.
How Trumpian was that? Such betting is, of course, strictly forbidden for active players and managers who are obviously privy to inside information. But, hey, does disregarding inconvenient rules to profit from a privileged position ring any bells these days in Washington?
Trump has, in fact, been uncharacteristically silent on the recent revelation that during the 2017 season, the World Series winners, the Houston Astros, concealed a video camera in center field to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams. That’s also illegal. Major League baseball punished the team by suspending its manager and general manager for a year, imposing a $5 million fine on its owners, and taking away its first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021.
For some fans and commentators, the Astros’ punishment was too severe or too mild. Opposing players, feeling victimized by the scheme, thought specific Astros should have been penalized, too. Yet such cheating is hardly new. In 1951, the “shot heard round the world,” a famed home-run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and sent them to the World Series, was linked to the stealing of signs from the Brooklyn Dodgers through a hand-held telescope. Only the technology has improved.
A Changing National Pastime
Once baseball’s opening day passed without a pitch this April, proof that the plague was winning, the Phoenix Plan was floated. It would require all major league players and employees to be sequestered in that area and continually tested at a moment when tests might still not be universally available. But, hey, haven’t VIP Jocks always gone to the head of the line? (Actually, a massive study of 10,000 Major League Baseball employees, from players to popcorn vendors, being conducted by Stanford University and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory to find out how many contracted and may have recovered from the virus has already gotten access to such testing kits at a time when even some front-line workers can’t get them!)
For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As the country reeled from the revelation of President Bill Clinton’s sexual liaison with a White House intern and with his impeachment just around the corner, a feel-good legend was born. A white man and a brown man rose in friendly rivalry to break the 37-year-old record of 61 home runs by Roger Maris, who, in turn, had bested Babe Ruth’s famed 60 in 1927.
The good-natured competition between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (who won with 70 homers) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs (66) was, at the time, celebrated as a balm that should soothe the country. And perhaps for many fans it did indeed serve as a comforting distraction in a difficult political moment.
But that summer’s golden glow soon faded as both players were reported to have taken steroids to muscle up. McGwire would admit it years later; Sosa would not. (A dark-skinned Dominican, he further complicated his legend by bleaching his skin to whiten himself, as if in anticipation of the Trumpian racial preferences to come.) Their contemporary, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, would eventually become the single-season home run leader with 73, but has never shaken rumors that he, too, used steroids.
Nor did baseball ever fully recover its sense of primacy as the national pastime or its sense of righteousness as one of America’s first major institutions to integrate. In fact, the sport is still overwhelmingly white and skewed toward an older audience, as well as slow and outdated in an era of tweeting speed.
Which is why, whether or not baseball opens this season in a vast sports self-isolation experiment, the key to President Trump’s future lies in his perverse relationship with the National Football League. That goes back more than 30 years to the moment he tried unsuccessfully (as with so many other business ventures) to elbow his way into the sport. Give him credit, though: ever attuned to the public mood, he did sense the rise of a new national pastime.
Bet On This
One reason for the NFL’s growing popularity is the way it uses college football as its minor leagues and early showcase for pro players (though possibly not this fall). For a passionate pro football fan, it’s a pleasure to see the stars of tomorrow in the making. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. In a recent commentary in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Nathan Kalman-Lamb of Duke opines that high-revenue men’s football and basketball “will become more valuable than ever as an enticement to lure steep tuition from students.”
And here’s an innovation that the president would glory in, one that would make post-pandemic football an even greater success: the addition of real-time nationwide legal gambling on games. Just imagine the sort of Trump-donor dollars that would be stacked up to support such a future industry. After all, estimations are that illegal gambling on pro and college football is already a $93 billion business. Legal or not, it’s an integral part of the fan experience (though in the post-pandemic world there will be a lot less money in so many pockets to gamble with).
The dream of easily accessible, high-tech legal gambling has been lurking on the sidelines for years. All that’s necessary to make it come true is for Congress to reverse the 1992 Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act, the federal law that bans it in most states. And the pandemic moment may prove perfect for just that, for “reopening” football in a new and even more Trumpian way, allowing fans to sit at home and bet what money they have left on games in progress: Will that field goal attempt split the uprights? Will Tom Brady in his new Tampa Bay Buccaneers uniform make that crucial third-down conversion?
However, to reopen pro football, as the president would wish, to make life seem “normal” again, stadiums might have to remain empty (or partially empty). Imagine, for instance, if San Francisco had actually beaten Kansas City (which it didn’t) in the Super Bowl on the first Sunday in February and the expected championship parade had followed a few days later, drawing a million people to that city’s streets. It might have proved an early version of Mardi Gras (a 2020 coronaviral disaster of a get-together).
Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. From the huddle to tackling, the game is, in every way, a potential disease transmitter. The only example of social distancing (besides Kaepernick kneeling alone) I can even remember might have been the 1958 West Point football team, which fielded a “lonesome end,” Bill Carpenter. On every play, he set himself up near the far sideline in an innovative formation. He never even joined the huddle and that team went undefeated.
If it proves impossible to stage football games, given social-distancing rules, the inevitable sport of the future is already waiting in the wings. Just under the radar of most of the middle-aged and elderly, especially those without access to children, is a fiercely contested, already commodified, fan-friendly industry with championships, heroes, endorsement contracts, and a ready market for expensive gear. I’m thinking, as you may have guessed, of competitive online video games, or esports. (Think of it as the revenge of the nerds.) No matter what Donald Trump does, sooner rather than later they’re likely to replace the old up-close-and-contagious live games.
It’s not hard to imagine a future in which individual competitors, regional and national teams, leagues, or even some version of the Olympics, would be watched by millions on streaming platforms on home screens and, once social distancing becomes a historical footnote, on the screens of sports bars as well, if not theaters and arenas. While combat games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, along with sports knock-offs like Madden and NBA Live, currently dominate esports, the future will undoubtedly include brainier fare that will turn art, architecture, banking, diplomacy, music, and maybe even poetry into online competitions even Nike and Google could sponsor.
Esports already supports ESPN-style commentary. There might even be room someday for a new reality show about them hosted by a motor-mouthed, pumpkin-headed former one-term president.
Who needs football after all? It would, in fact, be the definition of madness to launch a football season in a coronaviral world. But that doesn’t mean Donald Trump won’t push for just that. The advisory board he appointed for the reopening of sports includes, as my colleague Dave Zirin points out, “a group of brigands defined by their lack of care in normal times for the safety and well-being of their employees.”
It’s Trump’s dream team because, to win in November, he needs an America in which the National Football League is back in business big time. For him it’s open arms for the NFL, which could mean open season on the rest of us.

Many are mocking the president’s astonishing lack of understanding about even the most basic concepts of vaccines and how drug tests on them are performed.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/trump-mocked-for-spouting-nonsense-about-coronavirus-and-vaccine-trials/,alternet,vaccines,left,30.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"President Donald Trump on Monday held a White House meeting to discuss the possible development of a COVID-19 vaccine with representatives of the nation’s top pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Part of the meeting was open to the press and Americans are now mocking the President for the questions he asked as he pressured medical experts to say they could produce a vaccine in a few months – not the 12-18 it will take.
This clip of Trump trying to pressure the experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the federal government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is getting a lot of attention.

"Though Trump has not been as outspoken on vaccines as president as he was in the past, he has repeatedly falsely suggested that vaccines cause autism. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/when-did-vaccines-become-politicized-amid-a-measles-outbreak-suddenly-republicans-support-anti-vaxxers/,alternet,vaccines,left,30.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Republicans are opposing Democratic legislative efforts to tighten childhood vaccination laws across the country despite a rising number of measles outbreaks around the United States.
Bills to restrict exemptions for immunizations passed through legislative committees in Washington, Colorado and Maine this month without a single Republican supporter, Politico reports. Washington is currently dealing with one of the biggest measles outbreaks in the country. Democratic lawmakers are seeking to limit immunization exemptions on religious and philosophical grounds.
Republicans in New York, New Jersey and Arizona are also opposing Democratic-sponsored bills that would make it harder for parents to get exemptions from vaccinating their kids. Republicans in Mississippi and West Virginia have instead introduced bills that would expand vaccine exemptions in those states, Politico reported.
Congressional Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have also come out against mandatory vaccines. While there are certainly those on the left who oppose vaccines, like activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaxxer movement has been heavily criticized by Democrats while being praised by President Trump. Trump wanted Kennedy to lead a White House commission on vaccine safety before ultimately scrapping the plan, Kennedy told The Daily Beast.
Though Trump has not been as outspoken on vaccines as president as he was in the past, he has repeatedly falsely suggested that vaccines cause autism. “Massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism,” he wrote in 2012. “Autism WAY UP — I believe in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots. Too much for small child to handle. Govt. should stop NOW!” he wrote in 2014.
Officials are worried they are “three Trump tweets away” from the issue becoming even more polarized, according to MIT political scientist Adam Berinsky.
“There’s a credulity gap between the parties in regard to science that wasn’t there 25 years ago,” Berinsky told Politico, which noted that right-wing media figures like Tucker Carlson, Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones have voiced skepticism about vaccinations. At least three Republican gubernatorial candidates publicly voiced skepticism about immunizations on the campaign trail in 2018.
In the past, the government acted swiftly when faced with measles outbreaks like the kind we are seeing now. In 1972, officials barred unvaccinated children from school during a measles epidemic. The move was seen as a success and led to efforts around the country to implement stricter vaccine laws. The federal government also responded swiftly after 89 people, mostly children, died in a measles epidemic in 1990. The government spent millions to provide vaccines to poor communities and the disease stopped circulating in the United States within 10 years. Every case since 2000 has been linked to overseas travelers who infected unvaccinated Americans who then spread the virus to others.
Some experts worry that a government response in the current political climate could do more harm than good.
“My concern is that tightening requirements through the political process risks politicizing an issue that we can’t allow to be politicized if we’re going to maintain public health,” University of Michigan political scientist Brendan Nyhan told Politico.
Many Republicans have said they support vaccinations but oppose government mandates to require them. Other Republicans have rejected the idea that anti-vaxxers should be able to put others at risk as a matter of personal liberty.
Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is a physician, hit out at Paul’s claims that requiring children to be vaccinated to attend school would violate personal liberty for the “false sense of security” at a hearing last month. (In fairness, Paul is himself an ophthalmologist.)
“I have seen people who have not been vaccinated … who have ended up with terrible diseases for no other reason than they did not understand vaccination was important,” Cassidy said, later adding, “The requirement is just that you cannot enter school unless you’re vaccinated. Now, if you’re such a believer in liberty that you do not wish to be vaccinated, then there should be a consequence, and that is that you cannot infect other people.”",['falsely']
"Donald Trump appeared to make some important news via Twitter last night, announcing a dramatic new plan to use Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to remove “millions” of people from American soil.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-new-vow-use-ice-deport-millions-matters,msnbc,immigration,left,30.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump appeared to make some important news via Twitter last night, announcing a dramatic new plan to use Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to remove “millions” of people from American soil.
“Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.”
It was a striking announcement for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that we can’t say with certainty whether the plan exists outside of the president’s imagination. After all, Trump has made related vows – on immigration and other issues – with no real intention of following through. It’s unsettling, but in 2019, Americans have a president who occasionally announces major policy developments that he has no intention of actually implementing.
What’s more, this appears to be the latest in a series of incidents in which Trump blindsided his own team by making an announcement without alerting the relevant officials first. The Washington Post reported, “U.S. officials with knowledge of the preparations have said in recent days that the operation was not imminent, and ICE officials said late Monday night that they were not aware that the president planned to divulge their enforcement plans on Twitter.”
It’s not even clear if Trump’s declaration could be true. While the Justice Department has expedited deportation orders, the Post’s report added, “The president’s claim that ICE would be deporting ‘millions’ also was at odds with the reality of the agency’s staffing and budgetary challenges. ICE arrests in the U.S. interior have been declining in recent months because so many agents are busy managing the record surge of migrant families across the southern border with Mexico.”
The logistical challenges associated with removing “millions” of immigrants – a plan that would require extensive planning and personnel – are significant, and there’s little to suggest the Department of Homeland Security is prepared to execute such a scheme. (Trump tapped Mark Morgan to lead ICE only a few weeks ago.)
But then there’s that other nagging problem: if ICE was actually planning to launch such a plan next week, wouldn’t that be the sort of thing a president keeps under wraps?
The Washington Post’s article went on to note, “Large-scale ICE enforcement operations are typically kept secret to avoid tipping off targets. In 2018, Trump and other senior officials threatened the mayor of Oakland, Calif., with criminal prosecution for alerting city residents that immigration raids were in the works.”
There are already widespread concerns about Trump’s trustworthiness when it comes to handling sensitive and secret information. This telegraphing of a purported law-enforcement operation won’t help.
All of which leads us to an awkward question: why in the world did the Republican publish this tweet? If the plan may not be ready; if ICE wasn’t notified the announcement was coming; if officials may not yet be prepared to implement the plan; and if operational details like these are generally kept from the public, what prompted Trump to make the declaration?
Maybe the president lacks impulse control. It’s also possible he thought this news would be a convenient distraction from other headlines.
But if I had to guess, I’d say Trump, like a child who wakes up early on his birthday to open presents, is excited about the official launch of his re-election campaign today – and he wanted something new to brag about.
Using ICE to “remove millions of illegal aliens,” as Trump put it, is a crowd-pleaser – just so long as the crowd is made up of his most loyal followers – and it’s likely the president published the tweet to lay the groundwork for tonight’s applause in Orlando.
The other considerations – whether the plan is real, whether ICE is prepared, the economic impact of deporting millions of people, the gut-wrenching affects on so many families, et al. – are niceties for which Trump has no use.",['dramatic']
"This is all great news. It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers?",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/hpv-vaccine-trial-anti-vaxxers-mobilize-against-effective-cancer-prevention-ncna1033161,msnbc,vaccines,left,30.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"New research shows that the HPV vaccine is exceeding expectations in protecting individuals from HPV infection and precancerous cells. The study’s lead author, Mélanie Drolet, touts the potential “elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem.” The new study, which is an analysis of 60 million individuals from 14 countries, found that vaccination protected both the vaccinated and the larger population via a “herd immunity” effect. In other words, even those who were not vaccinated were indirectly protected. And while HPV is most typically associated with cervical cancer, the virus can also cause other cancers, such as anal and penile cancer, and cancers of the head and neck, as well as nonfatal conditions such as genital warts.
This is all great news. It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers?
It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers?
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the leading lights of the anti-vaccine movement, recently published a lengthy article intent on scaring parents and teens away from the HPV vaccine. A new anti-vaccine documentary, “Vaxxed 2: The People’s Truth,” will reportedly focus on the HPV vaccine. This follows three other films which similarly attack this vaccine. They have even hosted an entire conference on the topic.

I asked Dr. Abbey Berenson, an Ob/Gyn at the University of Texas Medical Branch who studies women’s health and the HPV vaccine, why this vaccine in particular has become such a target of the anti-vaxxer crowd. She suggested four reasons for why it’s recently generated such controversy. Some of these have to do with the vaccine’s efficiency and others are based more in abstract questions of morality, which is reflective of the changing nature of the anti-vaccine movement as a whole. No longer are anti-vaxxers simply claiming vaccines cause autism, as they once did. Now the movement has become more complicated and its motivations at once more diverse and more obscure.

First, she noted that many don’t realize the magnitude of the risk from HPV infection. “More than 80 percent of sexually active individuals will acquire an infection during their lifetime,"" Berenson told me. Once they have the virus, many will clear it without further issues, but the virus lingers in about 10 percent of infected women and can lead to precancerous cervical lesions. While these abnormalities can often be caught by Pap smears and removed by procedures such as LEEP (a minor surgical procedure), such medical interventions that may be painful and psychologically distressful. And they can be largely avoided now via vaccination. (Full disclosure: I’ve had a LEEP procedure previously, and it was both painful and a cause of later stress.)
Counterintuitively, these interventions, which prevent early stage pre-cancers from progressing, add to the misconception promoted by anti-vaxxers “that HPV is rare, and that cervical cancer is even more rare,” cautions Berenson. If it is so rare, some opponents of the vaccine argue, why do we need a vaccine? The reality is that many cervical cancer deaths are only prevented by screening and surgical removal of these pre-cancerous cells; the vaccine can prevent those pre-cancers from occurring in the first place.
Morality also comes into play here. An early argument against the vaccine was that it would promote promiscuity; multiple studies have demonstrated it doesn’t. Even so, “social conservatives have used this argument to counter HPV vaccine mandates, arguing that it would infringe on the rights of parents to discuss sex with their children when and how they want to,” says Berenson. It’s understandable that the idea of frank discussions about sex is concerning to parents — I have two teens myself — but avoidance only leaves them vulnerable to infection.

Then there’s the idea that the vaccine hasn’t been tested enough. “Though it has been on the market in the U.S. for 13 years, there is the misconception that the vaccine is still ‘new,’” notes Berenson. Yet there are newer vaccines that lack such controversy, including several of the vaccines that prevent meningitis.
Anti-vaxxers are playing into Americans’ existing fears and concerns about “Big Pharma,” a savvy strategy right now.
And finally, people may think that because protection is not perfect, it’s not worth getting (something also known as the “Nirvana fallacy""). One of the first HPV vaccines, Gardasil, protected against four strains of HPV: types 6 and 11, which cause genital warts, and types 16 and 18, which cause cancer. Berenson notes that as there are over 100 types of HPV, this vaccine did not prevent infection from all of them — but it’s still highly effective. The new version, Gardasil-9, adds protection against five more types of cancer-causing viruses, and is estimated to prevent about 90 percent of cervical cancers.
Money is also a factor. Anti-vaxxers are playing into Americans’ existing fears and concerns about “Big Pharma,” a savvy strategy right now. But the fact is that most vaccines make very little money for drug companies. The HPV vaccine is one of the few that has been profitable for the manufacturer (drug company Merck). But this is relatively rare in the vaccine industry. Many companies have abandoned the vaccine business due to low profit margins. For Merck, global sales for the first quarter of 2019 totaled $10.8 billion; Gardasil and Gardasil-9 accounted for $838 million of that sum. That seems high, but it should be noted that figure is sales, not necessarily profits. In the U.S., vaccination has been found to be cost-effective when compared to treatment of HPV-associated cancers. And while anti-vaxxers may suggest physicians who recommend the vaccine are profiting, research shows that vaccines as a whole are often money-losers for doctors. They recommend vaccines because they work, not because they are making doctors wealthy.
As part of the government’s Healthy People 2020 goals, 80 percent of adolescents would be vaccinated for HPV by age 15. We’re currently hitting about half that rate nationally, with considerable variation state-by-state. In contrast, Ireland has recently increased their HPV vaccination rate to 70 percent; in Australia, where the vaccine was developed, about 75 percent of boys and 80 percent of girls are vaccinated. We can do better.
We have a vaccine that prevents an assortment of cancers, but we cannot allow misinformation and anti-scientific mumbo jumbo to slow our progress. The HPV vaccine remains under-used, and anti-vaccine movies and conferences could make it more so if we’re not careful. We all need to step it up to protect our children: parents, physicians, legislators. Fighting an organized misinformation machine is an upward climb, but 60 million kids have shown the benefits of the vaccine. Australia is setting its sights on the elimination of cervical cancer. We sent a man to the moon; surely we can fight harder against a mere virus — and those determined to enable it.

"Instead, they want to force women and their doctors to subject dying newborns to further horrific medical intervention, to needles and lights and loud voices and scalpels and machines that will only prolong the inevitable, only prolong their pain.",https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/601350538/0/alternet_all~Trump%e2%80%99s-new-big-lie-Women-and-doctors-are-plotting-to-execute-newborn-babies/,alternet,abortion,left,31.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump returned over the weekend to what CNN accurately described as his “incendiary falsehood” that parents and doctors are “executing” newborn babies. Trump’s brazen lie came in response to Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers saying that he would veto a Republican “born alive” bill, one of the latest Republican efforts to use legislation to spread lies about abortion.
According to Trump, “The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby. I don’t think so.”
No, I damn well don’t think so, because it’s a lie.
In reality, what happens on some heartbreaking occasions is that a fetus has abnormalities so severe as to mean certain, often painful death—conditions “not compatible with life,” as writer Dana Zirlott described being told.
In humane states, when this is discovered before birth, women have the option to have a second- or third-term abortion and spare themselves and their children the misery of labor and delivery and a painful death. The decisions that Trump and Republicans want to deny women are first having that abortion when abnormalities are discovered and then choosing to allow their dying babies to die quickly and in peace. Instead, they want to force women and their doctors to subject dying newborns to further horrific medical intervention, to needles and lights and loud voices and scalpels and machines that will only prolong the inevitable, only prolong their pain.
“Execute”? Seriously? Even by Trump’s standards, this is an outrageous lie, though again we see how Trump and his party are fully aligned. Because those “born alive” bills are intended to more subtly convey the same lie: that there are babies being wantonly killed by doctors and parents. No. We’re talking about parents deciding not to put babies through pointless and traumatizing medical intervention, just as cancer patients might decide that suffering through another round of chemotherapy isn’t in their best interest when the chances it will work are tiny compared to the misery it will cause.
Trump’s lie has women carrying pregnancies to term for what? For the sport of executing a “beautifully wrapped” baby? Pregnancy and delivery are major stresses on a woman’s body. Women die all the time from them. When, usually around the 20th week of pregnancy—a point where, not coincidentally, Republicans focus their efforts toward banning abortion—women typically find out that the fetus they are carrying has conditions too severe for survival in anything but the most elemental and painful sense, a decent society allows women to terminate their pregnancies. U.S. society not always being decent, some women are denied that choice and instead have to face it in the form of a living, but dying, baby. Now Republicans are trying to deny women the choice to protect their babies from more pain, and Donald Trump is out there calling that execution.","['horrific', 'force', 'inevitable', 'prolong']"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
Traffic-free roads, plane-free skies and widespread brick-and-mortar closings have made the planet a beneficiary of the coronavirus pandemic — but only in the short term.
Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace in Beijing, said it's not time to ""pop the champagne corks"" just yet.
""It's hardly a sustainable way to reduce emissions,"" he said.
Many climate experts spotlighted 2020 as a critical year to take decisive action to limit the worst impacts of global warming. The year started with international attention on catastrophic wildfires and floods.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
The pandemic has overshadowed those issues — but with an environmental silver lining. The sharp reductions documented in carbon emissions and air pollution caused by coronavirus-related lockdowns have offered a sort of preview of the kind of improvements that can be made when drastic action is taken.
But the changes could easily be wiped out by efforts to quickly ramp up economies, including governments around the world that may be more willing to relax regulations to jump-start companies.
Despite an estimate showing that China — the world's biggest polluter — emitted 25 percent less carbon than in the same four-week period the previous year, Shuo remains skeptical about any lasting changes. He said he's worried that efforts to reignite China's economy might end up making the coronavirus epidemic a step backward for climate efforts.

That's because if history is anything to go by, China might not take the greenest option.
Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, based in Finland, said China responded to the 2008 financial crisis with the ""biggest, dirtiest stimulus program in the history of mankind.""

""It meant that for the following three years there was rapid growth in CO2 emissions, and we can now say with quite a bit of certainty that the overall impact was to nudge China on a more carbon-intensive, fossil fuel-intensive economy path,"" Myllyvirta said.
How other nations handle their responses to the economic shock will also be critical.
There are some glimmers of hope that ambitious climate action could play a part. European Union leaders have said the recently announced Green Deal must be at the heart of an ""intelligent recovery."" In spite of pressure to soften its green ambitions because of the pandemic, the EU has begun a consultation on tightening its carbon reduction targets by 2030.
Things look less promising in the U.S. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that the Trump administration had relaxed enforcement of regulations to help polluting industries deal with the pandemic. Gina McCarthy, who directed the EPA in the administration of President Barack Obama, called the announcement ""a license to pollute.""
Meanwhile, some industries in the U.S. and Europe are pushing to relax other regulations.
The plastics industry, recently on its back foot over ocean pollution fears, has worked to turn the tide on plastic bag bans.
Although the science is far from clear, plastic makers have long argued that single-use plastics are safer and more sanitary than reusable alternatives. Plastics Industry Association CEO Tony Radosewski recently stressed the need for more single-use plastics to combat the spread of the virus in a letter March 18 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
And it seems that many lawmakers are listening.
Plastic bag restrictions have been lifted across the country. In New York and Maine, recently introduced bans have been delayed. In Connecticut, plastic bag fees have been removed, while in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu prohibited shoppers from bringing reusable bags and ordered stores to make disposable bags available.
Likewise, the crisis has been a boon for the auto industry, with the Trump administration seizing the moment to fulfill a campaign promise to weaken Obama-era emissions standards. Automakers in the EU are also lobbying for a delay in tightening emissions restrictions because of the crisis. And in China, plans for tougher standards look likely to be delayed to help struggling automakers.
Airlines including Delta and JetBlue started off the year promising carbon offsets amid a growing culture of ""flight shaming."" The airline industry is also lobbying for government bailouts and regulation relief.

With governments focused on the crisis, there are also fears that the diplomatic push to refocus global efforts on reducing emissions could slip.
The United Nations' COP 26 climate conference, scheduled to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, has been postponed until 2021. It had been hailed as the most important climate gathering since the Paris climate accord was signed in 2015. Under that agreement, countries are due to come back to the table with new pledges to limit warming to the agreed-upon level of ""well below 2 degrees"" Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and ideally below 1.5 degrees.
It's ""abundantly clear that the countries of the world are falling short of the goals of the Paris agreement,"" said Dr. Simon Evans, deputy editor of Carbon Brief, a climate science website.
""Current pledges have the world on track for warming of about 3 degrees"" Celsius, he added.
Environmentalists have already raised concerns after Japan — the world's fifth-biggest emitter — became the first G7 country to announce its new targets. The plan, however, would simply maintain the country's existing emission reduction pledges. The World Resources Institute, a research nonprofit based in Washington, criticized the approach for falling ""woefully short.""
A successful outcome in Glasgow, therefore, looks likely to require extensive preparatory work and diplomacy. As Evans said, the Paris agreement was ""built on years of diplomatic efforts on the part of the French government and the whole French diplomatic service over the course of about three years.""
Although the postponement of the climate conference does provide welcome extra time for work toward a successful summit, he argued that it is ""inevitable that countries' preparatory work toward their new pledges"" will have been affected.
So while the world looks likely to emerge from the pandemic — at least temporarily — with cleaner air and lower emissions, ""any positive environmental impact"" from the crisis relies on our ""changing our production and consumption habits towards cleaner and greener,"" Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, wrote this week.
""Only long-term systemic shifts will change the trajectory of CO2 levels in the atmosphere,"" she said.","['relaxed', 'polluting']"
"Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/why-trump-is-so-eager-to-bring-back-professional-sports/,alternet,sport,left,31.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As controversies about the “reopening” of America loom over our lives, nothing seems as intrinsically irrelevant — yet possibly as critically important — as how soon major spectator sports return.
If sports don’t trump religion as the opiate of the masses, they have, until recently, been at least the background music of most of our lives. So here’s my bet on one possible side effect of the Covid-19 pandemic to put in your scorebook: if the National Football League plays regular season games this fall, President Trump stands a good chance of winning reelection for returning America to business as usual — or, at least, to his twisted version of the same.
That’s why he announced at a recent daily coronavirus briefing-cum-rally his eagerness to bring professional sports back quickly. Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old” — the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.
Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season — already poisoned by last year’s Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal — is up for grabs. Certainly, the proposed plan to turn stadiums in the Phoenix, Arizona, area into the sports equivalent of a vast movie set for the games of all 30 major league teams (to be played without fans) seems far-fetched at best.
But football, now the true national pastime, is another matter.
In sports terms, as in so much else in coronaviral America, these are desperately deprived times, even for casual fans. There will be intense pressure — and not only from the president’s base — for that sport’s return. For many people, mostly men, it’s the sustaining soap opera that has always carried them into the next week and the one after that, a porn-ish escape hatch from work and family, a currency of communication with other men, an eternal connection to a non-demanding hive.
Games for Lives?
Without professional (or even college) sports right now or realistically in the near future, fans feel even more unmoored in lives that, for all of us, are distinctly adrift. As they become edgier, it’s a reasonable bet (or at least my hope) that they will also become more open to questioning Trump’s mismanagement — or, to put it more bluntly, sacrifice — of their lives. Recent polls already seem to reflect this, with the latest Gallup Poll showing the steepest approval decline of his presidency.
The president, I suspect, fears just this, though perhaps, in the end, the hole in everyday life where sports once was may only reinforce fans’ sense (like the president’s) that the games are too important not to bring back, safety be damned. Certainly, Trump and other Republican politicians have already been willing enough to forfeit lives to boost their reelection chances.
The values and sensibilities of football are, of course, Trumpist in nature. That’s why former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s demonstration against racism — performed in a kind of public isolation — elicited such a harsh reaction from the president in the now-distant pre-pandemic era. That’s why the sport’s billionaire owners, predominantly Trump donors, shunned Kaepernick (although some of their teams could have used his skills). They didn’t dare to, or care to, give him another platform, not in an era when “president” and “racism” were becoming synonymous.
Even more tellingly, in an understandable but still disappointing me-first display, few of Kaepernick’s fellow players, most of whom are also African-American, supported him publicly. After years of being celebrated as America’s “warriors” and “role models,” they came up desperately short when it counted. Compare them to healthcare workers and other front-line heroes of this pandemic and you’ll realize just how far short they fell of even the most modest form of everyday bravery.
Not that, when it comes to pro sports, football was such an outlier. As activism goes, baseball, a sport that once produced transcendent progressive heroes like Jackie Robinson, Jim Bouton, and Curt Flood, has been eerily quiet in recent years. It’s a sport that the president has paid relatively little attention to — except for suggesting recently that Pete Rose, banned from baseball for life for betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was that team’s manager, should be allowed into its Hall of Fame.
How Trumpian was that? Such betting is, of course, strictly forbidden for active players and managers who are obviously privy to inside information. But, hey, does disregarding inconvenient rules to profit from a privileged position ring any bells these days in Washington?
Trump has, in fact, been uncharacteristically silent on the recent revelation that during the 2017 season, the World Series winners, the Houston Astros, concealed a video camera in center field to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams. That’s also illegal. Major League baseball punished the team by suspending its manager and general manager for a year, imposing a $5 million fine on its owners, and taking away its first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021.
For some fans and commentators, the Astros’ punishment was too severe or too mild. Opposing players, feeling victimized by the scheme, thought specific Astros should have been penalized, too. Yet such cheating is hardly new. In 1951, the “shot heard round the world,” a famed home-run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and sent them to the World Series, was linked to the stealing of signs from the Brooklyn Dodgers through a hand-held telescope. Only the technology has improved.
A Changing National Pastime
Once baseball’s opening day passed without a pitch this April, proof that the plague was winning, the Phoenix Plan was floated. It would require all major league players and employees to be sequestered in that area and continually tested at a moment when tests might still not be universally available. But, hey, haven’t VIP Jocks always gone to the head of the line? (Actually, a massive study of 10,000 Major League Baseball employees, from players to popcorn vendors, being conducted by Stanford University and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory to find out how many contracted and may have recovered from the virus has already gotten access to such testing kits at a time when even some front-line workers can’t get them!)
For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As the country reeled from the revelation of President Bill Clinton’s sexual liaison with a White House intern and with his impeachment just around the corner, a feel-good legend was born. A white man and a brown man rose in friendly rivalry to break the 37-year-old record of 61 home runs by Roger Maris, who, in turn, had bested Babe Ruth’s famed 60 in 1927.
The good-natured competition between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (who won with 70 homers) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs (66) was, at the time, celebrated as a balm that should soothe the country. And perhaps for many fans it did indeed serve as a comforting distraction in a difficult political moment.
But that summer’s golden glow soon faded as both players were reported to have taken steroids to muscle up. McGwire would admit it years later; Sosa would not. (A dark-skinned Dominican, he further complicated his legend by bleaching his skin to whiten himself, as if in anticipation of the Trumpian racial preferences to come.) Their contemporary, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, would eventually become the single-season home run leader with 73, but has never shaken rumors that he, too, used steroids.
Nor did baseball ever fully recover its sense of primacy as the national pastime or its sense of righteousness as one of America’s first major institutions to integrate. In fact, the sport is still overwhelmingly white and skewed toward an older audience, as well as slow and outdated in an era of tweeting speed.
Which is why, whether or not baseball opens this season in a vast sports self-isolation experiment, the key to President Trump’s future lies in his perverse relationship with the National Football League. That goes back more than 30 years to the moment he tried unsuccessfully (as with so many other business ventures) to elbow his way into the sport. Give him credit, though: ever attuned to the public mood, he did sense the rise of a new national pastime.
Bet On This
One reason for the NFL’s growing popularity is the way it uses college football as its minor leagues and early showcase for pro players (though possibly not this fall). For a passionate pro football fan, it’s a pleasure to see the stars of tomorrow in the making. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. In a recent commentary in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Nathan Kalman-Lamb of Duke opines that high-revenue men’s football and basketball “will become more valuable than ever as an enticement to lure steep tuition from students.”
And here’s an innovation that the president would glory in, one that would make post-pandemic football an even greater success: the addition of real-time nationwide legal gambling on games. Just imagine the sort of Trump-donor dollars that would be stacked up to support such a future industry. After all, estimations are that illegal gambling on pro and college football is already a $93 billion business. Legal or not, it’s an integral part of the fan experience (though in the post-pandemic world there will be a lot less money in so many pockets to gamble with).
The dream of easily accessible, high-tech legal gambling has been lurking on the sidelines for years. All that’s necessary to make it come true is for Congress to reverse the 1992 Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act, the federal law that bans it in most states. And the pandemic moment may prove perfect for just that, for “reopening” football in a new and even more Trumpian way, allowing fans to sit at home and bet what money they have left on games in progress: Will that field goal attempt split the uprights? Will Tom Brady in his new Tampa Bay Buccaneers uniform make that crucial third-down conversion?
However, to reopen pro football, as the president would wish, to make life seem “normal” again, stadiums might have to remain empty (or partially empty). Imagine, for instance, if San Francisco had actually beaten Kansas City (which it didn’t) in the Super Bowl on the first Sunday in February and the expected championship parade had followed a few days later, drawing a million people to that city’s streets. It might have proved an early version of Mardi Gras (a 2020 coronaviral disaster of a get-together).
Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. From the huddle to tackling, the game is, in every way, a potential disease transmitter. The only example of social distancing (besides Kaepernick kneeling alone) I can even remember might have been the 1958 West Point football team, which fielded a “lonesome end,” Bill Carpenter. On every play, he set himself up near the far sideline in an innovative formation. He never even joined the huddle and that team went undefeated.
If it proves impossible to stage football games, given social-distancing rules, the inevitable sport of the future is already waiting in the wings. Just under the radar of most of the middle-aged and elderly, especially those without access to children, is a fiercely contested, already commodified, fan-friendly industry with championships, heroes, endorsement contracts, and a ready market for expensive gear. I’m thinking, as you may have guessed, of competitive online video games, or esports. (Think of it as the revenge of the nerds.) No matter what Donald Trump does, sooner rather than later they’re likely to replace the old up-close-and-contagious live games.
It’s not hard to imagine a future in which individual competitors, regional and national teams, leagues, or even some version of the Olympics, would be watched by millions on streaming platforms on home screens and, once social distancing becomes a historical footnote, on the screens of sports bars as well, if not theaters and arenas. While combat games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, along with sports knock-offs like Madden and NBA Live, currently dominate esports, the future will undoubtedly include brainier fare that will turn art, architecture, banking, diplomacy, music, and maybe even poetry into online competitions even Nike and Google could sponsor.
Esports already supports ESPN-style commentary. There might even be room someday for a new reality show about them hosted by a motor-mouthed, pumpkin-headed former one-term president.
Who needs football after all? It would, in fact, be the definition of madness to launch a football season in a coronaviral world. But that doesn’t mean Donald Trump won’t push for just that. The advisory board he appointed for the reopening of sports includes, as my colleague Dave Zirin points out, “a group of brigands defined by their lack of care in normal times for the safety and well-being of their employees.”
It’s Trump’s dream team because, to win in November, he needs an America in which the National Football League is back in business big time. For him it’s open arms for the NFL, which could mean open season on the rest of us.

Overwhelming evidence shows that vaccination — including the flu shot — is safe. And all major medical groups urge nearly everyone over age six months to get the yearly flu vaccine.,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cold-and-flu/millennials-least-likely-get-flu-shot-anti-vax-beliefs-may-n1116601,msnbc,vaccines,left,31.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
One of the age groups most likely to be sidelined by the flu this season is also the least likely to get flu shots: millennials.
That's one of the findings from a survey released Thursday conducted by the American Academy of Family Physicians. The survey asked 1,000 adults across the country about flu myths and misconceptions.
More than half — 55 percent — of people in their 20s and 30s said they did not get the flu vaccine this year. Their reasoning, usually, was that they didn't have time or simply forgot.
But the poll also uncovered another potential reason for forgoing the flu shot: 61 percent of millennials familiar with the anti-vaccination movement said they agreed with at least some of those beliefs.
Dr. Alexa Mieses, a family physician in Durham, NC, said it's ""very alarming"" to see people under the influence of the anti-vaccine movement. She said people in their 20s and 30s often opt for urgent care or telemedicine services when they're sick, and are not as likely as older adults to have a long-standing relationship with a primary care doctor who could give them accurate vaccine information.
""I think there's a missed opportunity to really build trust and communication and encourage millennials to get flu shots,"" Mieses told NBC News.

Overwhelming evidence shows that vaccination — including the flu shot — is safe. And all major medical groups urge nearly everyone over age six months to get the yearly flu vaccine.
The AAFP survey also suggested that many parents aren't getting the facts right about flu vaccines. Nearly 60 percent of polled moms and dads said that their child has missed at least one flu shot. One-fifth of those parents were concerned the shot would somehow make their child sick, and 10 percent said they didn't think the flu is serious enough of an illness to warrant a vaccine.
Of course, the flu can cause severe illness. Already this season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been nearly 10 million cases of the flu, as well as 4,800 deaths. Thirty-two of those deaths were among children.
What's more, the CDC reported the two main flu strains making people sick this season are more likely to affect children and young adults than the elderly.
A Gallup survey of 1,025 adults released earlier this week also suggested that the anti-vaccine movement has damaged national attitudes about not just the flu shot, but also vaccines overall. The percentage of Americans who said it was important for parents to vaccinate their kids fell from 94 percent in 2001 to 84 percent in 2019.
And while the link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly discredited and debunked, 10 percent of adults in the Gallup survey believed it, up from six percent in 2015.
Anti-vax beliefs varied among racial and ethnic groups, the poll found. The AAFP survey found 61 percent of surveyed African Americans agreed with anti-vax beliefs, and many said they have not had a flu shot this year, and don't plan on getting one.
""I personally have seen a lot of mistrust around the flu shot in my one-on-one interactions taking care of patients,"" Mieses said. ""We absolutely have to acknowledge the way in which the medical system exploited African Americans in the past that now contributes to a feeling of mistrust.""
Flu shots were viewed more favorably by another group: Asian Americans. Nearly 9 in 10 agreed the flu shot helps protect others and the group had high vaccination rates.
Other findings from the AAFP survey included:
23 percent of men said they did not get a flu shot because they didn't think the illness was serious, compared to 5 percent of women.
19 percent of fathers said they did not have their child get a flu shot for the same reason, compared with 2 percent of mothers.
26 percent of all respondents said they'd talked with a doctor about the flu.

"In an era in which domestic terrorism is an increasingly deadly societal scourge, it’s dangerous when a sitting American president lies to rabid followers with tales of infants being executed in medical facilities.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-lies-about-abortion-take-alarming-and-incendiary-turn,msnbc,abortion,left,31.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump held his latest campaign rally in Green Bay on Saturday night, and as he’s done on several recent occasions, the president focused attention on abortion rights. In this case, the Republican described a very specific scenario:
“The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
The audience, on cue, expressed its disapproval of such conditions, booing loudly, as if their president had told them a gruesome truth.
He hadn’t. In fact, the scenario Trump depicted was ridiculously false. The New York Times published a detailed, albeit understated, fact-check piece, but the bottom line remains the same: there are no instances in which a healthy baby is born, only to be murdered soon after following a chat between a woman and her doctor.
If the White House can point to a single instance in which this has ever happened, anywhere in the United States, officials should feel free to present such an example to the public.
They won’t, because they can’t.
The problem in this case, however, isn’t limited to the obvious fact that the president lied – an alarmingly common occurrence – but rather, it’s the nature of this specific lie that stands out.
In an era in which domestic terrorism is an increasingly deadly societal scourge, it’s dangerous when a sitting American president lies to rabid followers with tales of infants being executed in medical facilities.
Complicating matters, Saturday night was an extreme example, but it was hardly the first example of Team Trump using incendiary rhetoric of late on the issue of reproductive rights.
As regular readers know, it was early last month when House Democrats launched an expansive investigation into presidential abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release an official press statement accusing Dems of trying to “distract” the public from the party’s agenda – which she said includes “killing babies after they’re born.”
Soon after, the president’s chief spokesperson went a little further. Asked about the virtues of possibly lowering the rhetorical temperature in D.C., the president’s chief spokesperson decided to do the opposite.
“Look, I think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable of coming together and agreeing on the fact that they’re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother’s womb or killing a baby after birth,” Sanders said.
The use of the word “comfortable” was of particular interest – as if Democrats agree with the White House press secretary’s incendiary and false rhetoric.
No good can come of this.","['deadly', 'scourge', 'dangerous', 'lies', 'rabid', 'tales', 'executed', 'societal', 'followers']"
"Coach Guerrier adds that the referee’s continued mid-game scrutiny ultimately made “a spectacle” of her daughter, and that he continued to insist that something would have to be done as the child grows up and continues to compete in the sport.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/virginia-basketball-ref-under-investigation-for-critiquing-a-black-10-year-olds-hair-mid-game/,alternet,sport,left,31.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"The city of Chesapeake, Virginia has barred an unnamed official from working any and all game after he very publicly analyzed and criticized an elementary school player’s hair during a game played on Saturday. The team’s coach, Erica Guerrier, told local station WAVY that she’d just called a timeout when the official crossed the court to approach her.
Guerrier assumed the referee simply wanted to clarify the length of the timeout, but she reports that he had other things in mind.
He asked to speak to me, and then he mentioned that one of the players, when she goes to the next level, she’s going to have to do something about her hair.
The ten-year-old in question was wearing braids, as many people of African American descent do, including many professional and college basketball players. The hairstyle typically weaves the wearer’s natural hair with additional hair, adding length, versatility, and convenience. The unnamed player had blue hair incorporated into her style, which apparently completely flummoxed the recently dismissed referee. But it was his subsequent actions that confused both Coach Guerrier, and the player—who also happens to be her daughter.
They had my daughter come over, and he pointed to, I guess the point where her natural hair meets the hair that was braided in, and said he didn’t know what that was. I said, ‘That’s her natural hair.’
Coach Guerrier adds that the referee’s continued mid-game scrutiny ultimately made “a spectacle” of her daughter, and that he continued to insist that something would have to be done as the child grows up and continues to compete in the sport.
Unwilling to let the ref’s offensive, apparently inaccurate, and completely unsolicited advice go unchecked, Guerrier reported the incident to the city’s recreation department. The official, who remains unnamed, has since been banned from any and all future games within the city, of any sport; additionally, the organization who contracted the ref out has also vowed to take action.
Hampton Roads Basketball Association commissioner Rick Ennis says the incident is under investigation and being “taken very seriously,”
The executive director of the Virginia High School League, Billy Haun, also took issue with the referee’s mid-game analysis of the child and her future prospects.
“If there were concerns about that young lady’s hair, that’s a conversation you have with a coach and with a player, and in this case as young as this player was, you have the conversation with the parent before the game starts, but not during the game. Somewhere private. That’s not something you do on the floor, during the game, before the game or after the game.”
Meanwhile, Coach Guerrier, who wears braids herself, insists she has no idea what the referee was talking about, and maintains that her kid just wants to play her beloved basketball.
Alluding to recent events in New Jersey, where high school wrestler Andrew Johnson was forced to chop his dreadlocks or forfeit (and still is being challenged. even with his now-shorter locs), Coach Guerrier expressed hope for the future.
Unfortunately it does appear that we are seeing a lot of issues like this, and I’m hoping that if the refs can get more education, and more training, we’ll see a decrease in these issues.
Whether it’s ignorance or an active attempt to do harm that fuels these incidents, the end result for these student athletes is the same. It’s no secret that knowledge is power, but situations like Guerrier’s and Johnson’s indicate that knowledge also can shape the actions of those who wield the power—in this case, the actions of uniformed men with whistles.
Thankfully, swift action means that Guerrier’s young daughter can keep playing her favorite sport, secure in the knowledge that at least one referee no longer has the power to stop a game because of “issues” that he simply does not understand.","['spectacle', 'scrutiny']"

"But so many anti-vaxxers add selfishness to their faults and put innocent children, who because of age or immune system deficiencies cannot be vaccinated, in danger.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/parents-see-their-unvaccinated-child-suffer-the-agonies-of-tetanus-yet-theyre-still-anti-vaxxers/,alternet,vaccines,left,32.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"While playing, a six-year-old boy in Oregon cut his head on some farm machinery. His parents cleaned and stitched the wound. Six days later his back and neck arched and he jaw began clenching. He had to be medevaced to a pediatric hospital where he was diagnosed with a severe case of tetanus.
He rapidly declined. At first he was alert. Then he had to be sedated and intubated as spasms interfered with his breathing. He was given an anti-tetanus immunoglobulin for his wound, as well as the DTaP vaccine, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. He was kept in a dark room with earplugs to reduce the intensity of his spasms. His scalp wound was cleaned by people who were trained to clean wounds.
The arching of the boy’s neck and back worsened. His blood pressure shot up. He became feverish. Doctors inserted a tube in his windpipe so a ventilator could help with his breathing, and treated him with neuromuscular-blocking drugs to reduce his muscle spasms. He would remain in the ICU for 47 days.
He then spent 2½ weeks in rehab. And it took another month before he returned to normal activities.
The cost for his treatment — excluding the medevac and rehab — amounted to $811,929. It is not clear who footed the bill. If the parents had instead given their child the recommended five doses of the DTaP vaccination the cost would have been $125-150. And their child wouldn’t have had to go through the agony of the disease.
Unbelievably, with all they had seen their child suffer, his parents not only refused the doctor’s suggestion that he receive another DTaP vaccination they also declined all the other scheduled vaccinations the boy had missed.
It is hard to see how this isn’t child endangerment.
Fortunately for the rest of the community, tetanus is not a contagious disease. So, in this case, the stupidity of the parents only put their own child at risk. But so many anti-vaxxers add selfishness to their faults and put innocent children, who because of age or immune system deficiencies cannot be vaccinated, in danger.
There may be some readers of this diary who maintain that vaccinations are risky and they are justified in ‘not injecting poison into my kid’. Sorry, there is no science which supports that position. There is, however, overwhelming evidence of the benefits of vaccinations — just ask all the kids who don’t have polio, smallpox, diphtheria, meningitis, rubella, hepatitis A & B, et al.
People who live in a society have an obligation to that society. I am forbidden from driving drunk. If I were to argue that I have ‘science’ to show that drinking doesn’t impair my ability to drive; or that I needed to drink to survive; or my religion mandates that I drink and drive, people would think I was nuts. And at the very least would demand I stay off public roads.
So if you chose not to vaccinate your child, please have the decency to keep your children away from other parents’ kids.","['anti-vaxxers', 'selfishness']"
"Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/auto-industry-trump-youre-going-the-wrong-way-emissions,msnbc,environment,left,32.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"In Barack Obama’s first term, the administration came to a fairly obvious conclusion: to address the climate crisis, we’re going to need to reduce emissions, and in the United States, the #1 source of carbon pollution is transportation. With that in mind, the Democratic White House created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.
Manufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.
Then Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.
By way of a defense, the Trump administration said the new policy would improve auto safety – which as we discussed at the time, makes about as much sense as it sounds.
Nevertheless, the Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. But the New York Times reports today on an unexpected twist: auto manufacturers believe the White House’s anti-climate plans have gone too far.
The world’s largest automakers warned President Trump on Thursday that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts – his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards – threatens to cut their profits and produce “untenable” instability in a crucial manufacturing sector. In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to fight climate change.
The problem for the industry has become a practical one: Trump intends to go so far in gutting pollution safeguards that many states intend to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.
That includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.
The result is an exceedingly messy economic dynamic, in which car manufacturers in the United States – which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy – will have to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.
Not surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.
The industry seems to realize this is a mess it helped create: companies wanted Trump to roll back Obama-era standards, so he did. What manufacturers didn’t realize is (a) how far the Republican would go; and (b) what would happen if they got what they wanted.
Complicating matters, of course, there’s a decent chance a Democrat will win the presidency next year, at which point he or she will likely abandon Trump’s pro-pollution posture and go back to the auto industry with some thoughts about even more stringent emissions rules.
The industry wants the White House to negotiate some kind of deal with California, with the intention of creating a national standard that everyone can live with. That seems unlikely: Team Trump broke off talks with the Golden State months ago, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has rejected the idea of halfway measures.

"Donald Trump, who was pro-choice in the not-too-distant past and never fit the mold of a far-right culture-war crusader, has taken a keen interest in abortion rights lately.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/targeting-abortion-rights-trump-unveils-domestic-gag-rule,msnbc,abortion,left,32.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump, who was pro-choice in the not-too-distant past and never fit the mold of a far-right culture-war crusader, has taken a keen interest in abortion rights lately. The president peddled a few transparent falsehoods about reproductive rights during his State of the Union address, for example, and he reportedly had a heated confrontation with Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) over the issue at the recent National Prayer Breakfast.
Today’s news, however, takes Trump’s campaign in an even more dramatic direction.
The Trump administration says it will prohibit taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, a move certain to be challenged in court by abortion rights supporters. The policy released Friday by the Health and Human Services Department pleased religious conservatives, a key building block of President Donald Trump’s political base. The administration plan would also prohibit family planning clinics from being housed in the same location as abortion providers.
As I always do when writing about this, I want to emphasize, in the interest of disclosure, that my wife works for Planned Parenthood. And while the White House is making changes to the family-planning program known as Title X, and those changes will affect a variety of health care organizations that provide services to millions of women, it’s not exactly a secret that today’s policy is intended to target Planned Parenthood.
What’s especially notable about today’s developments is how Trump is going after the women’s health organization. The issue is not about funding for abortion services, since there are already legal prohibitions on using taxpayer money to terminate pregnancies.
Rather, the administration’s new gambit is about blocking funds for those who might mention the word “abortion.” It’s why Trump’s policy is often described as the “domestic gag rule.”
The “global gag rule” is already in place. That policy, which Trump expanded soon after taking office, prevents non-governmental organizations that work on family planning from receiving public funds and telling women that abortion exists, even in countries where abortion is legal.
Sometimes known as the “Mexico City policy,” the global gag rule does extensive harm to women, especially in developing countries, but it’s nevertheless been embraced by every recent Republican administration. (Every recent Democratic administration has rejected the policy.)
Trump now intends to apply similar restrictions to health care organizations in the United States.
The policy debate may sound complex, but it’s relatively straightforward: entities that receive family-planning funding through Title X will no longer be able to fully inform women about their reproductive options. How will this help people? It won’t. This is about imposing government regulations on health care providers, limiting what physicians are allowed to say to their patients.
Expect a whole lot of lawsuits.","['far-right', 'crusader', 'pro-choice']"

First, it was a decided mixed dry run for voting at home in the many states new to major uses of absentee voting. Second, unsafe lines lasting over two hours in the nation’s capital showed we remain challenged with in-person voting as well. We have a lot of work to do ahead of the fall.
We also continue to see misfires based on clinging to a single-choice, plurality vote system. Many candidates won with less than 50 percent support this week, often in races where their party’s dominance means a November cakewalk. When winning takes less votes, it requires less engagement with voters — and it’s far from assured that elected officials will represent their constituents’ values and desires.
For example, look at the results from Indiana. Fifteen congressional primaries were held in the Hoosier state on Tuesday to determine both Democratic and Republican nominees. Eight of the 15 winners “won” with 43 percent of the vote or less. Six victorious candidates moved onto the fall election with a winning percentage in the 30s.
Indiana may have had the most plurality winners, but they were hardly the only state with this issue. Preliminary events show that the new mayor of Baltimore is nearly certain to take office after earning well under a third of the primary vote. In Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Iowa, U.S. House candidates won key races without a majority — indeed, one with under 30 percent in one of the nation’s most competitive districts — as did the Iowa Democrat selected to run against GOP incumbent Joni Ernst this fall.
Now many of these candidates may make fine public servants. And a low winning percentage isn’t their fault: Crowded fields often lead to plurality wins. Many primaries have more than one qualified candidate. Voters should get to choose among many vibrant options. But when a winner earns between 33 and 43 percent of the vote, as more than half of the Indiana victors did this week, that means upwards of two-thirds inside their own party preferred another candidate!
There’s always more legitimacy when a candidate wins a race with 50 percent of the vote. You also end up with a winner that reflects the will of the most people and is more certain to have listened to voters. After all, when candidates know they can win with just a third of the people, they campaign differently. They might focus on turning out their base. They might not bother trying to persuade supporters of another candidate or from another community. And with so many uncompetitive districts — none of Indiana’s nine congressional seats has flipped from one party to the other in nearly a decade — a low-turnout June primary can elevate someone to a safe seat in Congress without having to appeal to more than a third of their own side.
This is one of the reasons why our politics seems so stuck. Not only do we have a hard time talking to each other, the very structure of our elections doesn’t require our politicians to even try. And when you win by turning out the base, why risk appealing to anyone else? A broken system not only elects politicians who need not listen to everyone, it actually incentivizes them to govern that way too.
There is a better way and it’s catching on nationwide. Through the simple means of offering voters to indicate their backup choices in order of preference, ranked choice voting solves the problem of plurality winners. As proven in a growing number of state and city elections, It protects voter choice and ensures that everyone gets to select from a wide array of candidates. But it also pushes candidates to seek votes — be it a first, second or third choice — everywhere, and produces a winner with the widest support from everyone. It works like an instant runoff. Instead of selecting one candidate, voters rank the field in order. The winner is the first candidate to cross 50 percent; if no one does during the first round, then the last place finisher is eliminated and the backup choices come into play.
The true elegance of ranked choice voting is that it encourages candidates to campaign and to govern in an inclusive manner that leads to better representation for everyone. It incentivizes candidates to look beyond their base and seek out second-choice support. When they do that, they learn about new concerns, they develop greater empathy, and they’re able to bring that knowledge to Washington. Too many issues have been ignored for too long, in part because our system allows politicians to ignore too many people in their own districts. Under RCV, reaching out and hearing others suddenly becomes good politics.
It’s not a cure-all. Campaigns are less negative with ranked choice voting, but not without lapses in civility. But our politics needs more listening. It needs greater involvement and the voices of everyone. And we need leaders who are attuned to the concerns of everyone. Better elections would give us a better shot at success.","['stuck', 'broken', 'system', 'incentivizes']"
"But director Nick Sweeney’s forthcoming documentary on McCorvey, “AKA Jane Roe,” contains a major bombshell: her conversion from abortion rights icon to born-again Christian abortion opponent was “all an act.”",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/the-jig-is-up-the-woman-behind-roe-v-wade-became-a-hero-of-abortion-opponents-but-now-we-know-it-was-all-an-act/,alternet,abortion,left,32.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Since the 1990s, far-right Christian fundamentalists have been pointing to Norma McCorvey — the woman protected by the pseudonym “Jane Roe” in the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 — as an example of how deeply a woman could regret her decision to have an abortion. But director Nick Sweeney’s forthcoming documentary on McCorvey, “AKA Jane Roe,” contains a major bombshell: her conversion from abortion rights icon to born-again Christian abortion opponent was “all an act.”
No Supreme Court decision in U.S. history has infuriated the far-right evangelical movement more than Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in all 50 states: before Roe, the legality or illegal of abortion in the U.S. was determined on a state-by-state basis. And while Republicans have tried to undermine the protections of Roe in some states, the ruling has yet to be overturned after 47 years. Pro-choice activists fear, though, that it will be now that Justice Brett Kavanaugh occupies the seat once held by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the former swing vote who was more liberal on social issues like abortion and gay rights.
In the 1990s, anti-abortion activists were delighted when McCorvey (who died in 2017 at the age of 69) came out against abortion and asserted that she regretted having had one when she was younger. Fundamentalists like the Rev. Schenck and Operation Rescue’s Rev. Flip Benham used McCorvey to push the anti-abortion cause.
McCorvey, in a nursing home, is seen in Sweeney’s film saying, “This is my deathbed confession” and acknowledging that her embrace of fundamentalist anti-abortion crusaders was “an act.” Sweeney asks McCorvey, “Do you think you would say that you used them?’ — and she responds, “Well, I think it was a mutual thing. I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That’s what I’d say…. I’m a good actress. Of course, I’m not acting now.”
Journalist Cassie Da Costa, in the Daily Beast, describes Schenck as being “taken aback” by McCorvey’s confession. In the film, Schenck tells Sweeney, “I had never heard her say anything like this…. But I knew what we were doing, and there were times when I was sure she knew. And I wondered: is she playing us? What I didn’t have the guts to say was: because I know damn well we’re playing her.”
Schenck, in fact, has expressed regrets over manipulating McCorvey, lamenting, “What we did with Norma was highly unethical. The jig is up.”
Another revelation in the film has to do with McCorvey’s decision to end her romantic relationship with her female partner Connie Gonzalez — which, according to Da Costa, is something evangelicals pressured her into doing. Da Costa also notes that Sweeney’s film finds McCorvey sounding like her “pre-‘90s self, wisecracking and uninhibited,” when she says, “I wonder how many abortions Donald Trump is responsible for. I’m sure he’s lost count, if he can count that high.” She also straightforwardly asserts: “If a young woman wants to have an abortion, fine. That’s no skin off my ass. You know, that’s why they call it ‘choice.’ It’s your choice.”","['abortion', 'bombshell']"
"This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer ...",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-quarantine-protesters-america-form-unholy-covid-19-alliance-ncna1207796,msnbc,vaccines,left,33.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. At recent protests, we’ve seen the intersection of those who doubt the statistics and science behind COVID-19, primarily funded by right-wing groups, shouting alongside the distinctive red, white and black bold-lettered signs that have become the hallmark of anti-vaccine protesters.
This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.
These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message: The virus isn’t a big deal, scientists and the government are lying to you, and you can be a patriot by ignoring fear of the virus and going about your business. Ironically of course, this pandemic highlights exactly why we need vaccines.
This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits. Like anti-vaccine leader Andrew Wakefield, Mikovits pivoted from a legitimate science career to promoting antivaccine propaganda following a retraction of her most notable paper, which appeared in 2009 in the journal Science and suggested that a mouse retrovirus, XMRV, was the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unfortunately, other groups could not replicate Mikovits’s findings, and ultimately even her own lab could not do so when they tried to repeat the research using blinded samples.

In the meantime, Mikovits’s scientific career was already unraveling. A graduate student found an instance where Mikovits had falsified an image used in the XMRV paper. This finding, along with evidence of contamination in the original samples, led to a full retraction of the XMRV paper by Science. Since then, Mikovits has published two books, spinning her career downfall from something of her own doing into a case of martyrdom and mistreatment by “elites” — including Dr. Anthony Fauci. Though she claims in “Plandemic” that “she’s not anti-vaccine” (a common trope of anti-vaxxers), she has filmed interviews wearing a hat for the movie “Vaxxed II” (produced by Andrew Wakefield) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist who has compared vaccines to the Holocaust, promoted her newest book and also wrote its foreword.
In fact, most of the arguments the coronavirus deniers use are very similar to those anti-vaxxers have been pushing for decades. They suggest that scientists and scientific institutions are hopelessly corrupt, that these institutions and individuals are lying to you and only folks like Mikovits are willing to risk it all to tell you ""the truth"": that the government and specifically public health institutions should have no influence over how ordinary Americans live their lives and protect themselves and their communities from disease, and that natural immunity to infection is preferable to vaccines (even though with COVID-19, we are only beginning to learn about immunity and have no idea how long it will last, and how vaccine-induced immunity will compare to that).
Worse, anti-vaccine leaders are already spreading fear about a coronavirus vaccine that does not yet exist; at best, a vaccine is likely a year or more away from release, and they can’t possibly know anything about outcomes of human clinical trials on safety and efficacy at this time. Yet the protesters and amateur health experts are still saying it is dangerous.
While the narrative from many “reopeners” has focused on the economic damage created by lockdowns and closing of restaurants, beauty salons and other service industries, economists have pointed out that even if all of these opened tomorrow, the financial picture will not soon be healed because the virus is still out there, and many people will not yet feel safe participating in public events.
This means those who are most eager to “return to normal” are also those who seem to be least likely to take the steps that would make this possible. Instead of listening to public health experts who have emphasized a program of “test, trace, isolate” to identify new cases, anti-vaccine leaders are instead threatening to track the individuals who have signed up to assist in contact tracing efforts.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, which may help reduce viral transmission, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus,” and that “you’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions.” These claims are nonsensical, but have already made the rounds in anti-vaccine circles, convincing individuals that masks are more dangerous than the virus.
Troublingly, almost 20 percent of Americans currently say they’d be the last to get the vaccine if it was available, or wouldn’t get it at all.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus.""
We just finished a year in which measles cases were higher than they were at any point in the past quarter century. While exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases may be relatively low right now because of distancing measures, the last few months have also seen a decline in children seeing physicians for wellness checks and routine vaccinations, putting children at an increased risk upon reopening. And despite suggestions from President Donald Trump that the virus will go away without a vaccine, we need to be prepared to deal with this epidemic for years rather than months.
Luckily, this is an area where everyone can pitch in to help. If you have friends and family who are hesitant about vaccines, gently discussing with them why you think they are important may help to sway their opinion. If you want to understand why “Plandemic” is such a successful piece of propaganda that even friends and relatives you consider to be “reasonable” are sharing the video, this article will help you see the techniques used by filmmakers to influence individuals, and spot them elsewhere. And if you want a good debunking article to share with those friends, educate yourself. (This article goes through the claims piece by piece.)
To successfully fight back against this virus and others, we need to be led by science, not anti-science opportunists. For those of you who are new to the myriad ways that the anti-vaccine movement can harm public health, we welcome you to join us.","['propaganda', 'unholy', 'unscientific', 'right-wingers', 'disgraced']"
"The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/how-the-religious-rights-war-against-abortion-is-built-on-lies-grifting-and-bullying/,alternet,abortion,left,33.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Tuesday, both the pro- and anti-choice world were rocked by a revelation that undermines literal decades of religious right nonsense. Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous “conversion” to anti-abortion activism was a con job.
McCorvey told filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, “AKA Jane Roe,” “I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
For pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey’s “conversion” as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don’t want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless “abortion industry.”
McCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was “saved” by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can’t be trusted with autonomy, and need “godly” men to guide them.
(Benham, a supposedly wise and “pro-life” guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among the protesters, clinic staff and the pregnant people seeking care.)
Having spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey’s “conversion” was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped, even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn’t try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn’t seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.
So yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers — nearly half a million dollars over the years — sounds about right.
But the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn’t about McCorvey’s character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire raison d’être is telling lies — often over-the-top, melodramatic lies — in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the “right” of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.
The anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become one big, long con.
The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.
For instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)
To bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice “testimony” is all to often as McCorvey described it: “[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”
But this “born alive” mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump’s weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.
The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.
A series of “undercover” videos purporting to “prove” that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling “baby parts” out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would turn out to be bullshit, but too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.
Sure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn’t sell baby parts.” They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research — research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.
This myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest buffer zone around clinics by claiming they were merely “sidewalk counselors” trying to “help” women.
An investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They’re a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.
“If women want careers and education and everything and they don’t want children,” one protester complained to Filipovic, “what are they doing having sex?”
Another complained that “there were no problems” back when women “had to be obedient to their husbands.”
Instead of contraception, a protester argued, “the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”
The court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters merely wished to “counsel” women.
Anti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they’re righteous warriors going up against a sleazy “abortion industry” and trying to “save” women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.
In truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them of their rights and subjugate them both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stands with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny and lurid fantasy.
The press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie will help open up some eyes.
But it’s also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don’t want or can’t bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It’s a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.","['spinning', 'fanatics', 'anti-choice', 'implausible']"

"It probably has something to do with Pitlyk being a Federalist Society member, a former Brett Kavanaugh clerk, and a fierce opponent of reproductive rights who’s argued that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave” adverse effects on society.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-confirms-fierce-opponent-reproductive-rights-federal-bench,msnbc,abortion,left,33.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It’s not just the quantity of Donald Trump’s judicial nominees who’ve been confirmed by Senate Republicans; as regular readers know, it’s also the quality that’s striking.
Sarah Pitlyk, for example, received a “not qualified” rating from the American Bar Association, and the ABA’s rationale is quite persuasive: “Ms. Pitlyk has never tried a case as lead or co-counsel, whether civil or criminal. She has never examined a witness. Though Ms. Pitlyk has argued one case in a court of appeals, she has not taken a deposition. She has not argued any motion in a state or federal trial court. She has never picked a jury. She has never participated at any stage of a criminal matter.”
So why in the world did she get a judicial nomination from Donald Trump? It probably has something to do with Pitlyk being a Federalist Society member, a former Brett Kavanaugh clerk, and a fierce opponent of reproductive rights who’s argued that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave” adverse effects on society. Jennifer Bendery explained this week:
In private practice and as special counsel at Thomas More Society, Pitlyk established a clear record of attacking reproductive rights. She defended anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, who broke federal and state laws by secretly recording and deceptively editing videos that falsely claimed to expose Planned Parenthood’s illegal sale of fetal tissue. She defended Iowa’s six-week abortion ban that was later struck down as unconstitutional. In another case, Pitlyk argued that it is “scientific fact” that “human life begins at the moment when a human sperm fertilizes a human egg.” (It is not scientific fact.) After losing that case, Pitlyk lamented that “the trial court’s judgment treated the embryonic children as inanimate objects, not human beings with the same interests as other unborn children.”
It’s against this backdrop that the Trump White House chose Pitlyk for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. This afternoon, the 42-year-old conservative was confirmed by the Republican-led Senate on a 49-44 vote.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was the only Republican to oppose her nomination, and no Senate Democrats broke ranks to support her.
I’ve long believed the lasting effects of the Trump era can be boiled down to the three C’s: the climate, the nation’s credibility, and the federal courts. Health care benefits can be restored, alliances can be rebuilt, and tax breaks can be scrapped, but the lost years on dealing with the climate crisis are tragic; it’ll be a long while before the world forgets that we’re a country capable of electing someone like Trump; and with Republicans confirming young, far-right ideologues to the bench at a brutal clip, we can expect a generation’s worth of conservative court rulings.
Postscript: For those keeping score, as of this afternoon, the GOP-led Senate has confirmed 120 of Trump’s district court nominees, 48 of his circuit court nominees, and two of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees. (These figures have been corrected since original publication.)","['grave', 'fierce']"

"After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt that modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/why-theyre-scared-of-greta-thunberg-right-wingers-cant-deny-this-climate-activists-truth-in-desperation-theyre-resorting-to-malice-bigotry-and-lies/,alternet,environment,left,33.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt of this. The modern-day conservative was revealed, in all his glory, as a weak-minded coward who hides behind unearned privileges, because he is incapable of handling a fair-minded debate, much less real moral accountability.
Thunberg’s trip to the U.S. for the UN Climate Action Summit had, before this week, already been a remarkable success. The 16-year-old’s steely-eyed courage has helped inspire kids across the country — and the world — to join her call to strike from school last week and stand up for more aggressive action to combat the climate crisis.
On Monday, Thunberg finally gave her speech before the UN and, for those who haven’t yet seen it, it was a doozy. She accused world leaders of betrayal and warned that the “eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.”
(As a note: Yes, you can read a transcript of the speech, but it really helps to watch the video, because Thunberg’s passion and clarity is powerful and sobering.)
Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say. Even though Thunberg is capable of doing things many on the right refuse to do — such as read and understand scientific evidence — the argument is that Thunberg and her fellow youth activists cannot think for themselves.
On Fox News, Michael Knowles of the right-wing outlet Daily Wire, in full grumpy-old-man mode, described Thunberg on Monday as “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” a statement so ugly that even the network was forced to denounce it.
It’s a bit unclear, however, what Fox News was apologizing for, since Knowles’ argument is just a blunter version of what all their pundits have said about Thunberg.
Laura Ingraham compared Thunberg and other climate activists to “Children of the Corn,” a Stephen King story about children brainwashed into a murderous cult.
Industry-backed climate change denier Marc Morano argued that Thunberg is “causing and instilling fear in millions of kids around the world,” as if the anxiety were anything but a rational reaction to real world events. He also compared climate science to “medieval witchcraft.”
The New York Times, in a stunning demonstration of bad judgment, let climate-change denier Christopher Caldwell write an op-ed complaining that “a 16-year-old is not a legally responsible adult,” and trying to discredit her by saying “she is diminutive and fresh-faced, comes off as younger than her years.”
Of course, Donald Trump had to get in on the action, talking down to Thunberg with a sarcastic tweet that was the equivalent of telling her she’d be pretty if she smiled more.
All of these attacks say almost about Thunberg or the other kids — some as young as elementary age — who have correctly called out adults for failing to do more to slow climate change.
These attacks speak to conservatives’ dependence on irrational social hierarchies that determine who is “right” or “wrong” not by virtue of evidence or reason, but based on who has more social power due to age, gender or social class. Thunberg and her youth activist cohort strike fear into the hearts of right-wingers precisely because they have uncovered the lie that age automatically grants wisdom.
Just by doing her thing, Thunberg has exposed the way climate-change deniers hide behind their unearned privileges to assert themselves as authorities on a topic where they are literally denying basic scientific facts. To borrow Morano’s metaphor, climate-change deniers are reminiscent of witch hunters in the past, who hid behind the Bible and the authority of their gender in order to persecute innocent women.
When liberals understandably lashed out at these insipid, ad hominem attacks against Thunberg, some conservatives shifted their tactics towards false claims that Thunberg and her allies are hiding behind her age, using youth as a shield from criticism. Professional troll Charlie Kirk added a charge of hypocrisy, since those same liberals who were supposedly claiming that you “can’t” criticize a 16-year-old also criticized a group of high school kids in January who were videotaped in MAGA hats acting like jackasses after an anti-choice protest in Washington.
The same people who say we can’t criticize 16-year old ANTIFA climate activist Greta Von Thunburg …Spent months shamelessly attacking the Covington Catholic High School kids—just because they supported our president 🤔 — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 23, 2019
This would be an argument, I guess, if anyone was actually assert a blanket “you can’t criticize kids” argument. In reality, criticizing the Covington students and supporting Greta Thunberg share a common assumption, which is the exact opposite of Kirk’s claim. In both cases, teenagers are fledgling moral actors, and, as such, deserve to be taken seriously when they make political statements.
In fact, there’s an entirely consistent argument here. The Covington were old enough to be held responsible for their actions. Greta Thunberg is old enough to be considered a rational actor whose arguments hold weight.
To put it another way, no one is saying you can’t criticize a teenager. But the “criticisms” of Thunberg are nothing more than ad hominem attacks and vitriol, thrown out there in a desperate attempt to hide the fact that the right has no substantive argument on the climate crisis.
We saw the right pulling the same trick with the Parkland kids, pretending that liberals were “using” the students for nefarious political purposes. In fact, young people are standing up on issues like climate and guns for the simple reason that they are the people most under threat.
Conservatives are, as usual, the ones being inconsistent here. When kids express right-wing views, they are assumed by conservatives to be responsible actors thinking for themselves. able to think for themselves. When they support progressive or liberal causes, they are accused of being puppets. The fairest response is to see both conservative and liberal kids as responsible for their own opinions, and to give credit or condemnation appropriately.
Ultimately, it’s good to see grown men so afraid of a teenage girl speaking truth to power. It’s a reminder that conservatives know, on some level, that their authority is a house of cards, and that they don’t deserve all the deference they get simply by being white, male or old. Thunberg represents the possibility of looking past rules that treat young women as inherently inferior and not worthy of respect. She demands that we take people’s arguments and beliefs seriously, instead of dismissing them based on perceptions rooted in identity. Conservatives understand one thing clearly —they will not do well in a world where what you say and do matters more than who you are.","['egos', 'protection', 'racket', 'mediocre', 'fragile']"

LONDON — After days of mounting pressure, the top soccer clubs in Britain said Friday they would ask their players to take a 30 percent pay cut as the sport grapples with the damaging fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
""The overriding priority is to aid the health and wellbeing of the nation and our communities, including players, coaches, managers, club staff and supporters,"" the Premier League said in a statement following a pivotal meeting earlier in the day.
It remains to be seen how players — whose wages span a wide spectrum in a league with no salary cap — will respond to the request following calls from government ministers to cut their often-astronomical wages.
The outbreak has plunged the world's most popular sport into crisis across Europe, its financial epicenter.
Its leagues have been left uncompleted for the first time since World War II, and several organizations governing different parts of the game in the United Kingdom have been locked in talks over who should take the financial hit.
Some of Europe's biggest clubs, such as FC Barcelona in Spain and Juventus in Italy — two of the hardest-hit countries — have already agreed to hefty wage cuts with their stars.
With the coronavirus pandemic causing economic pain around the world, a growing chorus feels that soccer stars, many of whom are millionaires, should do more to share the pain being felt by others.
Meanwhile there are some, namely several leading ex-players, who believe that soccer is an all-too-easy target for a government perhaps eager to shift the focus from its own shortcomings.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is quarantined after testing positive for COVID-19, has come under fire for a lack of coronavirus tests and personal protective equipment for health care workers.

Nevertheless on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock turned his crosshairs on the sport.
Hancock addresses the media Thursday. Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street / Reuters
""Given the sacrifices many people are making"" in the health service, he told a daily briefing, ""the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution, take a pay cut and play their part.""
There is no salary cap in the Premier League — the most watched domestic soccer competition in the world — and its biggest stars earn the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars a year, plus equally lucrative sponsorship deals.
For many here, spring is heralded by roars of adulation and despair from pubs and couches across the nation as the league reaches its final games. That was cut short this year with most teams still having nine games to play.
While no one questions Liverpool should win the league given the team's dominant points tally, there are still huge questions about which three teams get relegated to the second-tier league, and which trio gets promoted the other way.
This is worth tens of millions of dollars on a club's balance sheet. Furthermore the Premier League estimates its 20 clubs face a shortfall in television revenue of 750 million pounds ($920 million) if the season is not completed.
Already several English clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United, have chosen to furlough some nonplaying staff, taking advantage of a government pledge to pay up to 80 percent of these workers' wages.
As well as a possible 30 percent pay cut for its players, on Friday the Premier League said it would donate 20 million pounds (about $25 million) to the publicly funded National Health Service. This has followed increasing calls for action from several leading politicians.
""It is deeply unfair that these staff should take less money home with players retaining full salary,"" Julian Knight, a lawmaker with the ruling Conservative Party and the chair of Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, wrote in an open letter to the league this week.
He pointed out that the purpose of the government furlough scheme was not to prop up wealthy soccer clubs, calling for sanctions for any team treating playing and nonplaying staff differently.
Several former soccer players and other commentators have said the debate is not so simple, however.

They accuse the government of trying to score points and deflect attention from criticism of its coronavirus response. Some health experts say Johnson was far too slow in locking down the country, wasting valuable time while it was clear the outbreak was already at his door.
The United Kingdom is still not testing nearly as many people as in other countries and front-line medical workers say they are in desperate need of more personal protective equipment.
Gary Neville, a former Manchester United defender and one of the most decorated players in the history of the league, tweeted, ""Matt Hancock calling [soccer players] out when he can’t get tests in place for NHS staff is a f@@@@@g cheek!""
He is among those who believe that it is too early to pass judgment while talks are ongoing.
""Let's give the players a chance to respond before we have this hugely judgmental pile-on that we always get nowadays,"" Gary Lineker, one of England's biggest stars in the 1980s and the early 90s, told Sky News.
""Footballers are always an easy target, and I hate whataboutery,"" he added, ""but where are the big businessmen, where are the CEOs of these enormous companies? No one ever seems to care about them.""",['often-astronomical']

Coronavirus vaccine and quarantine protesters in America form an unholy COVID-19 alliance. These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message.,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-quarantine-protesters-america-form-unholy-covid-19-alliance-ncna1207796,msnbc,vaccines,left,34.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. At recent protests, we’ve seen the intersection of those who doubt the statistics and science behind COVID-19, primarily funded by right-wing groups, shouting alongside the distinctive red, white and black bold-lettered signs that have become the hallmark of anti-vaccine protesters.
This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces.
These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message: The virus isn’t a big deal, scientists and the government are lying to you, and you can be a patriot by ignoring fear of the virus and going about your business. Ironically of course, this pandemic highlights exactly why we need vaccines.
This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits. Like anti-vaccine leader Andrew Wakefield, Mikovits pivoted from a legitimate science career to promoting antivaccine propaganda following a retraction of her most notable paper, which appeared in 2009 in the journal Science and suggested that a mouse retrovirus, XMRV, was the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unfortunately, other groups could not replicate Mikovits’s findings, and ultimately even her own lab could not do so when they tried to repeat the research using blinded samples.

In the meantime, Mikovits’s scientific career was already unraveling. A graduate student found an instance where Mikovits had falsified an image used in the XMRV paper. This finding, along with evidence of contamination in the original samples, led to a full retraction of the XMRV paper by Science. Since then, Mikovits has published two books, spinning her career downfall from something of her own doing into a case of martyrdom and mistreatment by “elites” — including Dr. Anthony Fauci. Though she claims in “Plandemic” that “she’s not anti-vaccine” (a common trope of anti-vaxxers), she has filmed interviews wearing a hat for the movie “Vaxxed II” (produced by Andrew Wakefield) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaccine activist who has compared vaccines to the Holocaust, promoted her newest book and also wrote its foreword.
In fact, most of the arguments the coronavirus deniers use are very similar to those anti-vaxxers have been pushing for decades. They suggest that scientists and scientific institutions are hopelessly corrupt, that these institutions and individuals are lying to you and only folks like Mikovits are willing to risk it all to tell you ""the truth"": that the government and specifically public health institutions should have no influence over how ordinary Americans live their lives and protect themselves and their communities from disease, and that natural immunity to infection is preferable to vaccines (even though with COVID-19, we are only beginning to learn about immunity and have no idea how long it will last, and how vaccine-induced immunity will compare to that).
Worse, anti-vaccine leaders are already spreading fear about a coronavirus vaccine that does not yet exist; at best, a vaccine is likely a year or more away from release, and they can’t possibly know anything about outcomes of human clinical trials on safety and efficacy at this time. Yet the protesters and amateur health experts are still saying it is dangerous.
While the narrative from many “reopeners” has focused on the economic damage created by lockdowns and closing of restaurants, beauty salons and other service industries, economists have pointed out that even if all of these opened tomorrow, the financial picture will not soon be healed because the virus is still out there, and many people will not yet feel safe participating in public events.
This means those who are most eager to “return to normal” are also those who seem to be least likely to take the steps that would make this possible. Instead of listening to public health experts who have emphasized a program of “test, trace, isolate” to identify new cases, anti-vaccine leaders are instead threatening to track the individuals who have signed up to assist in contact tracing efforts.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, which may help reduce viral transmission, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus,” and that “you’re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions.” These claims are nonsensical, but have already made the rounds in anti-vaccine circles, convincing individuals that masks are more dangerous than the virus.
Troublingly, almost 20 percent of Americans currently say they’d be the last to get the vaccine if it was available, or wouldn’t get it at all.
Instead of advocating mask-wearing, in “Plandemic” Mikovits claimed that wearing masks “literally activates your own virus.""
We just finished a year in which measles cases were higher than they were at any point in the past quarter century. While exposure to vaccine-preventable diseases may be relatively low right now because of distancing measures, the last few months have also seen a decline in children seeing physicians for wellness checks and routine vaccinations, putting children at an increased risk upon reopening. And despite suggestions from President Donald Trump that the virus will go away without a vaccine, we need to be prepared to deal with this epidemic for years rather than months.
Luckily, this is an area where everyone can pitch in to help. If you have friends and family who are hesitant about vaccines, gently discussing with them why you think they are important may help to sway their opinion. If you want to understand why “Plandemic” is such a successful piece of propaganda that even friends and relatives you consider to be “reasonable” are sharing the video, this article will help you see the techniques used by filmmakers to influence individuals, and spot them elsewhere. And if you want a good debunking article to share with those friends, educate yourself. (This article goes through the claims piece by piece.)
To successfully fight back against this virus and others, we need to be led by science, not anti-science opportunists. For those of you who are new to the myriad ways that the anti-vaccine movement can harm public health, we welcome you to join us.","['dangerous', 'self-defeating', 'unholy']"
"Although U.S.-based sporting goods companies now produce almost none of their own gear, increasing the cost of imports from China could still jeopardize thousands of U.S. white collar jobs in design, product development, and sales and marketing.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/everything-you-need-to-play-baseball-is-made-in-china-and-getting-hit-by-trumps-tariffs/,alternet,sport,left,34.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Since 1983, Kim Karsh has helped baseball teams deal with an inconvenient fact of the modern economy: Almost everything you need to play America’s homegrown sport is now made in China, from cleats to batting helmets.
Lately, supplying the game’s amateurs and fans has gotten more difficult. Karsh owns California Pro Sports in Harbor City, California, where invoices for big customers now include a caveat: Prices are up due to the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese imports, and they could rise further on short notice.
“We have to explain to our customers that the trade war affects them as it does us,” Karsh said. “We can pass on pretty much everything to the consumer. The problem is, now they will shop lower-quality items. Some understand, and other people don’t.”
Although duties set to kick in soon will affect all manner of sports equipment that hasn’t been made in America for decades, baseball enthusiasts are perhaps affected most because so many items are needed to play the game.
Baseball caps were hit first by the third round of China tariffs that went into effect at 10% last September and rose to 25% in January, on top of the 7.5% base tariff. Those added about a dollar to the cost of a hat, Karsh said. Trump’s tariff will rise to 30% in October, bringing the total to 37.5%, and possibly causing another price increase.
Retail prices for metal bats have already risen $5 to $10 each, Karsh said, even though a 10% hike on bats and other sporting goods was put off until Dec. 15 as the Trump administration made a concession to the Christmas shopping season. On Aug. 23, President Donald Trump said he would jack up the levy to 15%.
Baseballs themselves faced tariffs starting Sept. 1, and although Karsh said prices haven’t increased yet, he’s expecting to add between $3 and $5 per dozen. “If you can buy now that would be a plus,” Karsh told customers in August, figuring the only direction the tariffs will go is up.
Since the sporting goods industry has become so dominated by Chinese imports, teams have little ability to shop around. Meanwhile, equipment is not the only mounting cost, with rising fees at municipal fields and less volunteer labor from parents. That raises the barrier to entry for a game that’s supposed to be accessible to everyone.
“Baseball is struggling. The expense of playing the game has gone up sky high,” said Charles Blackburn, executive director of the National Amateur Baseball Federation, a 105-year-old volunteer group that organizes teams and tournaments. “It’s a tax on top of a tax. They’re discouraging people from playing the game of baseball.”
The story of how baseball gear became a product of China is the tale of globalization, writ small.
In the 1800s, when baseball consisted of loosely organized leagues with few uniform standards, balls were made in a factory in Natick, Massachusetts, and sewn together by women who worked out of their homes. The manufacturer, Harwood, developed the iconic figure-eight seam design involving 108 stitches and horsehide tanned on the outskirts of town.
As baseball developed, the major leagues standardized their balls and cut exclusive sourcing deals, first with Spalding and then with St. Louis-based Rawlings. Partly owned by Major League Baseball, Rawlings is now the nation’s largest supplier of baseball gear, and also a heavy importer from China.
Even slight alterations in baseball materials and construction can lead to heated debates, fueled most recently by a rise in home runs that some have theorized may have to do with the 5-ounce spheres having less drag. But the physical ball hasn’t changed much since 1977, when Rawlings officially started producing them for both the National and American Leagues. A cork center is coated with rubber, wound with hundreds of yards of wool and cotton yarn, and finished with hand-sewn leather. Since it remains a labor-intensive process — with no machine yet able to navigate those 108 stitches — manufacturers have moved around the world in search of lower wages and higher-volume suppliers of raw materials with less toxic production processes.
“We had the facilities and the know-how,” said Bill Sells, senior vice president for government affairs at the Sports and Fitness Industry Association. “And as the market developed, others became proficient at making balls, and it went overseas.”
While the major leagues won’t be affected much by tariffs on Chinese imports, everyone from Double A players down through the office softball team will be.
Rawlings made its balls in Puerto Rico until the 1960s, when it moved to Haiti — along with other ball manufacturers, like Wilson — in search of lower labor costs. As workers in Haiti agitated for higher pay and the political situation destabilized, Rawlings then moved production to Costa Rica, where balls are still produced for the major leagues and Triple A teams.
But in 1994, Rawlings started sourcing lower-end balls for mass consumption in China. Now, America imports $69.5 million worth of baseballs and softballs from China annually, compared with $18.5 million from the next-largest supplier, Costa Rica.
Only one company still produces baseball gloves in America — Texas-based Nokona, which sells mitts for hundreds of dollars each. Wooden bats are still produced in the U.S., which is rich in lumber. But metal and composite bats are largely made in China, and those are the ones used by club and school leagues with the tightest budgets.
Although U.S.-based sporting goods companies now produce almost none of their own gear, increasing the cost of imports from China could still jeopardize thousands of U.S. white collar jobs in design, product development, and sales and marketing.
Rawlings, which declined to comment, argued against tariffs in a June letter to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. It said that if tariffs were imposed, “entire product lines” could be eliminated, and job losses within its 670-person domestic workforce would be “inevitable.”
So far, no major manufacturers have responded to Trump’s tariffs by saying they will move their supply chains out of China. Baden Sports, a family-owned sporting goods manufacturer based in Renton, Washington, tried to rush its orders to get inventory through customs before new duties take effect. After that, CEO Michael Schindler says they’ll try to distribute increased costs.
“We’re working hard with our suppliers to help alleviate the hit,” Schindler said. “The Chinese government changes the currency to account for about 2%. Then you pass a couple percent on to your customers, and you might eat a percent or two. Everybody participates in the pain. It’s in everybody’s best interest to keep the thing going.”
But Schindler acknowledged China may not be his company’s last stop. As China moves on to higher-tech products like electric cars, Schindler said, the painstaking work of ball manufacturing may migrate to nations earlier on in their industrial evolution, like Bangladesh and Malaysia — just as his company shifted from Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s to Japan and on to China. For his next move, Schindler is thinking about someplace closer to his customers, like Mexico or the Dominican Republic.
The problem is, other countries don’t have the labor force or the port capacity yet to handle a total exodus from China. Also, relationships with suppliers are hard to build: Baden has worked with the same Taiwanese-owned company since 1979, as it moved with him from country to country. It’s easier to relocate within Asia than to move halfway across the world — especially when the tariff situation seems to change from week to week.
“If you’re not thinking about it, you’re nuts,” Schindler said. “It’s almost impossible to do anything about it quickly. And partially because when the tariffs were first talked about, you never really knew. It’s really hard to make hard and fast decisions when you really don’t know.”
Uncertainty also faces most baseball teams and leagues as they plan next season’s purchases.
The Fort Wayne TinCaps, a Class A team, has braced for a cost increase. The team bought 8,160 balls last year at $53 a dozen, which comes to $36,040. Rawlings has an exclusive contract to supply the TinCaps with Chinese-made baseballs, so there’s no way to bargain down the price. Although the TinCaps share the cost of bats and balls with their major league affiliate, the San Diego Padres, collectively the tariffs could mean a significant cost increase by next year.
And that could also affect the fan experience, from Double A teams on down, said team President Michael Nutter. One of the traditions of these games is tossing balls out to eager fans, which can get expensive if prices rise.
“I know some teams and operators are really strict with the baseballs and discourage players from throwing them to fans and trying to protect every single baseball,” Nutter said, while noting that he’ll continue to encourage fielders to be generous. “Really, to us, this is a cost of doing business.”
Youth sports have even less wiggle room. Tariffs have been on the minds of school baseball team managers across the country, many of whom operate on fixed budgets from local governments, dues paid by parents and ticket sales.
“Anytime there’s an increase in equipment cost, it gets passed on to the gate, or you have another fundraiser,” said Shelton Crews, executive director of the Florida Athletic Coaches Association. “I know up here in Tallahassee, parents have to raise so much money or make up the difference in cash.”
At a certain point, increased prices will translate into lower sales, especially for the mom-and-pop shops like Karsh’s that already operate on razor-thin margins.
“We can survive, but it’s very unfortunate what they’re doing,” Karsh said. “The manufacturers have put all their eggs in one basket. But there’s not much I can do about it. Not much anybody can do about it.”",['jeopardize']
The specter of “abortion regret” has been used by lawmakers and judges alike to impose or uphold rules making it harder for people to get abortions.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/debunking-the-abortion-regret-narrative-data-shows-women-99-percent-of-women-feel-relief-over-their-decision/,alternet,abortion,left,34.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Last month, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a Kentucky law requiring doctors to describe ultrasound images and play fetal heartbeat sounds to people seeking abortions. The state argued that these images and sounds best “inform a patient of the nature and consequences of an abortion.” In 2007, Justice Anthony Kennedy based his decision to ban an abortion procedure on the grounds that “while we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice” to have an abortion.
The specter of “abortion regret” has been used by lawmakers and judges alike to impose or uphold rules making it harder for people to get abortions. In Kansas, doctors must tell their patients that life begins at conception and the fetus is a separate living being — neither of which is supported by medical research. Women in Kentucky who want an abortion now must undergo an ultrasound and hear a description of their fetus. And in states like Missouri or North Carolina, women must have at least two appointments with a waiting period in between before an abortion, to give them time to reconsider their choice. This means they must make an appointment, get time off work, arrange child care, and drive, sometimes for hours, to the clinic. Then they must do it all again days later.
But new research reveals the truth: Five years after obtaining an abortion, the overwhelming majority of women do not regret their decision—even those who had difficulty deciding to get one. This evidence contradicts the narrative pushed by anti-abortion activists and elected officials, who use “abortion regret” as a red herring to implement regulations pushing abortion out of reach for many—especially women of color and low-income people.
Our research found that, among hundreds of women having abortions all across the United States, most felt their decision was the right one for them five years later. The research was based on data from 667 participants in the Turnaway Study, a long-term study of the effects of abortion on women’s lives conducted by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at University of California, San Francisco.
As expected, women experienced ranges of negative and positive emotions in the week following the abortion. Yet, over time, women reported declining intensity of all emotions. This was true even for women who said that their decision to get an abortion was a difficult one and those who felt they would be shamed by friends and community for their choice. Both immediately after the abortion and five years later, the feeling women most often expressed about their decision was relief, not regret. By the end of five years, the chance that women reported that their abortion was the right decision was 99 percent. Ninety-nine percent. Our team also found in an earlier paper that there was no difference in emotions between women who sought abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy and those who sought later abortions.
Until now, without data on the topic, the narrative around supposed “abortion regret” has been dominated by the few individual stories of women who come to wish they’d made a different choice. But the responses from the women we studied in our paper paint a very different picture.
“It was the right thing for me, for my son, for our family. You know, it just—I don’t think about it,” one participant told researchers. “It’s just like oh, thank god. You know, my life would be so different right now.”
“It was the right decision because I was still a child myself. I wasn’t financially stable. It was just—it wasn’t really smart for me to bring a child into this world to struggle along with me,” another said.
“I actually feel guilty sometimes—you know people talk about you’ll regret it all your life—I don’t ever think of it. I feel guilty that I don’t feel guilty. You know what I mean? I don’t want people to think that I’m heartless, I’m not—at all. I just, it doesn’t impact me negatively,” said a third.
This last quote is particularly revealing, because it shows how women are told by society that they should regret their abortions and then, even when they know fully that abortion was the right decision for them, feel guilt for not meeting that expectation. Contrary to lawmakers’ stated intentions, research shows that restrictions targeting the “regret” claim don’t actually dissuade women from getting abortions. They just worsen stigma and make getting care more difficult.
It is true that some women have complicated feelings about their abortions, and some do wish they had not had one. But it is also true that every major life decision, medical or otherwise, carries with it the risk of regret. As bioethicists have pointed out, some patients regret having heart surgery or seeking a kidney transplant. For that matter, some people regret marrying their high-school sweetheart, or having children. All of these actions may carry lasting consequences. Yet lawmakers do not intervene to take these choices away — only the choice to have an abortion.
Access to abortion has clear benefits for both the person seeking care and for society as a whole. The social, economic, and medical good of abortion access for the hundreds of thousands of women who seek care every year outweighs the small chance that someone will later regret her choice. Lawmakers who claim to care about women’s emotional health would do better to listen to the hundreds of thousands of women who seek abortion care every year and know it is the right decision. They should stop using false “abortion regret” arguments as an excuse and step out of the way.

But the national and global trends spin a tale of two separate realities. An irrational fear of vaccines among well-educated and largely white Americans has fueled an utterly preventable and dangerous disease that had been considered “eliminated” by scientists.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/anti-vaxxers-are-just-as-bad-as-climate-deniers/,alternet,vaccines,left,34.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"There have been at least 555 confirmed cases of the highly contagious measles virus since January alone, prompting officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to call this sudden eruption the worst outbreak of the disease in nearly 20 years. The story about measles spreading across the U.S. is unfolding alongside a parallel and troubling trend of increased measles infection rates globally. The World Health Organization issued a report at the same time as the CDC, finding that measles cases worldwide have surged by nearly four times the average number in the first three months of the year.
But the national and global trends spin a tale of two separate realities. An irrational fear of vaccines among well-educated and largely white Americans has fueled an utterly preventable and dangerous disease that had been considered “eliminated” by scientists. Reuters explained that “[a] growing and vocal fringe of parents in the United States oppose measles vaccines believing, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in the vaccines can cause autism or other disorders.” Michelle M. Mello, a professor of law at Stanford Law School and a professor of health research and policy at the Stanford University School of Medicine explained to me in an interview that while there have been pockets of low vaccination rates in minority communities—like Somali Americans in Minnesota or Orthodox Jews in New York City—“On a national level, overwhelmingly, the demographic is educated, relatively affluent white families” that are choosing not to vaccinate their children. The epicenters of measles outbreaks are in liberal states such as California, New York, Oregon and Washington.
Meanwhile, as an example of how the rest of the world struggles with a dangerous infectious disease, the East African island of Madagascar is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in history. More than 115,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed in a country of 25 million, and at least 1,200 people have so far died. The dead are mostly children under the age of 15. Less than 60% of that nation’s residents are vaccinated, but not because of a fear that vaccines cause autism. Instead they face a more traditional obstacle: poverty.
In Madagascar, mass malnutrition has helped the virus spread faster among young people with compromised immune systems. According to Associated Press, although the measles vaccine is free, “Simply reaching a clinic for help can be a challenge. Many people in Madagascar cannot afford to see a doctor or buy medicine, and health centers often are understaffed or have poorly qualified workers.”
It is a monumental ode to human stupidity that the wealthiest nation in the world teeters on the edge of a dangerous measles epidemic at the same time that poor nations are struggling to vaccinate their residents. It is worth contrasting the first-world problems of misinformed American parents who are literally organizing “measles parties” for their children with poverty-stricken families in nations like Madagascar.
Measles is not a disease to be taken as lightly as the so-called “anti-vaxxers” would have you believe. Mello explained, “This is not a disease where your [unvaccinated] kid has to share saliva or snot with another kid to get infected. You just have to be in a room where another person with measles has passed through in the last couple of hours to have a 90% chance of infection.” Although mortality rates from measles are low in a nation like the U.S., there can be long-lasting damage to health, including severe hearing loss. Yet there are hordes of American parents who are more terrified of vaccines than they are of measles.
There has been much hand-wringing in the U.S. about how best to approach the fiercely defended views of the anti-vaxxer crowd. Study after study conducted by reputable scientists and published in peer-reviewed journals confirm the same thing: Vaccines do not cause autism. Worse, an examination of how best to convince parents about the safety of vaccines had a depressing conclusion that “existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate.” In other words, anti-vaxxers are fact-resistant and, when presented with reality, dig their heels in even harder to maintain their fantasy.
If any of this sounds familiar, there is an analogy to be made between anti-vaxxers and climate-change deniers. Both groups place faith in a gut-level sense of their rightful position on an issue that has far-reaching existential implications. And both groups refuse to acknowledge the vast body of sound scientific literature proving them wrong. But on the issue of climate there is an encouraging trend showing that a significant percentage of Americans who once believed global warming wasn’t real are now accepting the science. One report found that about a fifth of those who had recently seen the light did so because they personally felt the impacts of climate change.
Where vaccination rates are concerned, we see the opposite trend. Federal officials released data late last year showing that the percentage of unvaccinated toddlers in the U.S. increased four-fold in the last 17 years. It is no wonder we are seeing outbreaks of a disease like measles. Mello explained that “In order for us to stop the spread and slow it to the rate where the outbreak actually extinguishes itself in relatively short order, we need about 95% of the population to receive the [measles] vaccine.” She issued a dire warning that “If it goes any lower than that, the very high rate of spread will cause the outbreak to take on a wildfire aspect.” Just as some have suggested that “climate-change deniers are a danger to our security,” there is a strong case to be made that anti-vaxxers are a threat to our collective health.
Perhaps it is a testament to the effectiveness of vaccines in the U.S. that has fueled the ignorance of just how necessary they are. We had more or less eliminated measles from the U.S. and have had similar levels of success in eradicating other infectious diseases through vaccinations. We no longer live in a world where a parent’s worst nightmare is their child contracting smallpox. But as vaccination rates drop, diseases are returning. The question is: Do we really need to wait for hardcore anti-vaxxers to come around once they see the fatal impacts of their choices?
Just as combating climate change requires strong policy solutions and laws to stop runaway warming, laws are needed to maintain the herd immunity our society relies on. The state of California passed a mandatory vaccination law banning parents from refusing vaccines based on their personal beliefs. While this has encouragingly led to increased vaccination rates, the rate of medical exemptions has also increased, suggesting that some physicians and parents are taking advantage of a loophole. More recently, New York City officials have taken even stricter measures—requiring mandatory vaccinations and barring unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the disease from being in public places.
There are, of course, limits to the analogy of climate change denialism and the beliefs of anti-vaxxers. But there is also a terrifying link. As our planet warms, scientists predict that infectious diseases like measles are more easily transmitted. In other words, two waves of ignorance could be colliding at this very moment to produce the kind of mayhem we have not seen in our lifetimes. At a time when we have so much information at our fingertips, could humanity’s downfall really be marked by such incomprehension and thick-headedness?","['irrational', 'preventable', 'utterly']"
"Reporting from Buzzfeed News Thursday evening exposed how President Donald Trump’s immigration policies led to four deaths and preventable surgeries for children held in the administration’s detention regime, including one eight-year-old boy whose forehead was partially removed.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/12/explosive-report-reveals-ice-negligence-of-detained-children-resulted-in-deaths/,alternet,immigration,left,34.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Reporting from Buzzfeed News Thursday evening exposed how President Donald Trump’s immigration policies led to four deaths and preventable surgeries for children held in the administration’s detention regime, including one eight-year-old boy whose forehead was partially removed.
“I am sick to my stomach,” said activist Sophie Ellman-Golan of the report’s allegations.
Reporter Hamed Aleaziz broke the story, based on an internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whistleblower report he obtained about conditions for immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
The report is here (pdf).
Immigrants held in ICE jails received medical care so bad it resulted in 2 preventable surgeries, inc. an 8-yr-old who had to have part of his forehead removed, & contributed to 4 deaths, according to a complaint from a whistleblower. My investigation: https://t.co/ugsJE9eRC2 — Hamed Aleaziz (@Haleaziz) December 12, 2019
“The allegations appear in a DHS memo, obtained by BuzzFeed News, containing reports of detainees being given incorrect meds, suffering from delays in treating withdrawal symptoms, and one who was allowed to become so mentally unstable he lacerated his own penis and required surgery,” Aleaziz said of the report on Twitter.
According to Aleaziz’s reporting:
The allegations were laid out in a March 20 memorandum signed by Cameron Quinn, DHS’s officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and sent to top ICE leadership. The memo describes the whistleblower as someone within the ICE Health Service Corps, or IHSC, which provides medical care and oversight for detainees in the agency’s custody. BuzzFeed News does not know the person’s identity. … The allegations in the DHS memo, if corroborated, are a cry from someone working for ICE echoing what advocates, lawsuits, and other media reports have been saying for years: The medical care ICE provides and oversees for immigrants in private and local jails could be very bad.
Advocacy group Latino Victory opined that the memo’s allegations were just examples of what ICE is meant to do under the president.
“ICE is operating exactly as the Trump administration wants it to when migrants are being so violently neglected,” the group said.
In a call to action, immigrant youth organization United We Dream noted there’s blame to go around for the treatment of migrants by the federal government.
“While horrific torture like this occurs inside immigration concentration camps, Democrats and Republicans are moving forward on funding the Trump’s white supremacist agenda,” said United We Dream.
“These aren’t isolated events,” said immigration legal services nonprofit RAICES. “This is systematic and it’s happening across the country.”
“We must #FreeThemAll,” said RAICES, “and #EndDetention before it’s too late.”","['exposed', 'regime', 'detention']"

"Meanwhile, a pervasive celebrity culture — in which celebrities are considered trusted “experts” solely because of their fame — has poisoned the idea of what constitutes expertise.",https://www.alternet.org/2018/07/celebrity-pseudoscience-here-are-nine-household-names-whove-pushed-bad-science-public/,alternet,vaccines,left,34.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In our post-truth era, scientific illiteracy has morphed into science denialism. Today, people simply declare their own truths. As a consequence, science is losing its platform as a source of truth. Meanwhile, a pervasive celebrity culture — in which celebrities are considered trusted “experts” solely because of their fame — has poisoned the idea of what constitutes expertise.
Nowhere is the merger of these two trends more evident than in our embrace of “celebrity science,” which, because it often involves issues of health, might not only be misleading but harmful. Some celebrities actually do have science backgrounds; Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience, springs to mind. Unfortunately, many celebrities have waded into debates within fields in which they have neither expertise nor training, perhaps unintentionally injecting doubt into scientific certainty and often even harming public health efforts. Here are a few of the worst celebrity offenders
This article first appeared in Salon.
Anti-vaccine crusaders Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, Kristin Cavallari and Rob Schneider: The anti-vaccine crowd frequently falls back on the claim that vaccines cause autism, despite more than two dozen studies clearly showing that vaccination does not increase the incidence of autism. Nor did it make a whit of biological sense that vaccines would.
Gwyneth Paltrow: Paltrow is probably best known for her promotion of vaginal steaming, jade eggs and cleansing enemas. Paltrow believes that vaginal steaming with mugwort balances female hormones and cleanses the uterus. Apart from the fact that mugwort isn’t a hormone and vaginal steam will never reach the uterus, vaginal steaming can cause burns and bacterial infections. The jade eggs placed in the vagina to enhance muscle tone put users at risk of toxic shock syndrome, and the “toxin-removing” colonic enemas Paltrow prescribes, which have no proven benefit in otherwise healthy people, can cause dehydration, infections, vomiting and, worst of all, bowel perforations.
Suzanne Somers: Somers has become a one-woman industry, promoting megavitamins, supplements and minerals, as well as skin-care, weight-loss, and detoxification products on her website. When Somers says use her hormone replacement therapy because it’s “all natural” and isn’t going to cause the sort of problems that regular hormone replacement therapy cause, that’s bad advice. If a product causes a physiological response, it doesn’t matter whether it’s synthesized in a laboratory or derived from nature — it still has the same effect, which means that it can also have the same negative consequences. Also, antioxidants like Vitamin A, Vitamin E and the mineral selenium given in quantities vastly in excess of the recommended daily allowance actually increase the risk of cancer and heart disease.
Katie Couric: On Dec. 4, 2013, Katie Couric aired an episode that raised serious questions about the HPV vaccine. The show featured two mothers whose children had developed either a fatal heart arrhythmia or chronic fatigue syndrome following the vaccine. Couric’s mistake in this episode was the omission of more than a dozen studies performed on more than a million people showing that the vaccine doesn’t cause the problems claimed on her show. She never helped her viewers think through the difference between causal and coincidental associations. Katie Couric’s program only showed that the HPV vaccine doesn’t prevent fatal heart arrhythmias or chronic fatigue syndrome. It only prevents HPV infections.
Angry that she had chosen to scare parents away from a life-saving vaccine, the medical and scientific community rained down on Katie Couric, who later offered a weak, ineffective apology.
Steve Jobs: In 2011, Steve Jobs died from pancreatic cancer. However, Jobs didn’t have the type of cancer for which medicine had little to offer (adenocarcinoma); rather, he had a neuroendocrine tumor — a cancer that has a 95 percent chance of survival with early surgery. Unfortunately, instead of getting the surgery that might have saved his life, Jobs chose acupuncture, bowel cleansings and fruit juices. When he finally had surgery, it was too late. While one can’t blame him for his death, Jobs undoubtedly put himself at unnecessary risk by choosing an alternative course.
Donald J. Trump: Trump’s war against science is also a war against children. When a figurehead like Trump repeats the myth that vaccines cause autism, as he did during the presidential debates, many parents may choose not to vaccinate, putting children at unnecessary risk. When Trump denies climate change, which he stated unequivocally was a hoax, viruses like chikungunya and Dengue travel farther north, now entering states like Texas and Louisiana, causing more American children to suffer. Or when, by picking Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos, he says that creationism is as valid as evolution, children fail to learn important scientific facts in an age where scientific competitiveness with other countries is critical.
The Trump administration’s denial of climate change is reminiscent of the Church’s condemnation of Galileo for daring to say that the Earth wasn’t the center of the firmament, as stated in the Bible. When Galileo was taken away in chains he took a moment to look back at his accusers and say, regarding the Earth, “It still moves.” His point: You can lock me away, but that won’t change the facts. And the Trump administration can deny climate change, back out of the Paris Accords, and insist that the EPA remove the phrase “climate change” from its website. But that won’t change the facts. Human activity is changing our climate. “The good thing about science,” wrote Neil deGrasse Tyson, “is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it.”
Although non-celebrity science might not have the glitz or pizzazz of celebrity science, it’s still your better bet. It’s OK to trust websites generated from university centers, hospitals and professional societies even though those who are doing the talking are probably less attractive and less interesting than the celebrities. One other thing: Avoid trusting sites that are selling something or that make claims that sound too good to be true

"Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden, the 16-year-old’s steely-eyed courage has helped inspire kids across the country — and the world — to join her call to strike from school last week and stand up for more aggressive action to combat the climate crisis.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/why-theyre-scared-of-greta-thunberg-right-wingers-cant-deny-this-climate-activists-truth-in-desperation-theyre-resorting-to-malice-bigotry-and-lies/,alternet,environment,left,35.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men. After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt of this. The modern-day conservative was revealed, in all his glory, as a weak-minded coward who hides behind unearned privileges, because he is incapable of handling a fair-minded debate, much less real moral accountability.
Thunberg’s trip to the U.S. for the UN Climate Action Summit had, before this week, already been a remarkable success. The 16-year-old’s steely-eyed courage has helped inspire kids across the country — and the world — to join her call to strike from school last week and stand up for more aggressive action to combat the climate crisis.
On Monday, Thunberg finally gave her speech before the UN and, for those who haven’t yet seen it, it was a doozy. She accused world leaders of betrayal and warned that the “eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.”
(As a note: Yes, you can read a transcript of the speech, but it really helps to watch the video, because Thunberg’s passion and clarity is powerful and sobering.)
Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say. Even though Thunberg is capable of doing things many on the right refuse to do — such as read and understand scientific evidence — the argument is that Thunberg and her fellow youth activists cannot think for themselves.
On Fox News, Michael Knowles of the right-wing outlet Daily Wire, in full grumpy-old-man mode, described Thunberg on Monday as “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” a statement so ugly that even the network was forced to denounce it.
It’s a bit unclear, however, what Fox News was apologizing for, since Knowles’ argument is just a blunter version of what all their pundits have said about Thunberg.
Laura Ingraham compared Thunberg and other climate activists to “Children of the Corn,” a Stephen King story about children brainwashed into a murderous cult.
Industry-backed climate change denier Marc Morano argued that Thunberg is “causing and instilling fear in millions of kids around the world,” as if the anxiety were anything but a rational reaction to real world events. He also compared climate science to “medieval witchcraft.”
The New York Times, in a stunning demonstration of bad judgment, let climate-change denier Christopher Caldwell write an op-ed complaining that “a 16-year-old is not a legally responsible adult,” and trying to discredit her by saying “she is diminutive and fresh-faced, comes off as younger than her years.”
Of course, Donald Trump had to get in on the action, talking down to Thunberg with a sarcastic tweet that was the equivalent of telling her she’d be pretty if she smiled more.
All of these attacks say almost about Thunberg or the other kids — some as young as elementary age — who have correctly called out adults for failing to do more to slow climate change.
These attacks speak to conservatives’ dependence on irrational social hierarchies that determine who is “right” or “wrong” not by virtue of evidence or reason, but based on who has more social power due to age, gender or social class. Thunberg and her youth activist cohort strike fear into the hearts of right-wingers precisely because they have uncovered the lie that age automatically grants wisdom.
Just by doing her thing, Thunberg has exposed the way climate-change deniers hide behind their unearned privileges to assert themselves as authorities on a topic where they are literally denying basic scientific facts. To borrow Morano’s metaphor, climate-change deniers are reminiscent of witch hunters in the past, who hid behind the Bible and the authority of their gender in order to persecute innocent women.
When liberals understandably lashed out at these insipid, ad hominem attacks against Thunberg, some conservatives shifted their tactics towards false claims that Thunberg and her allies are hiding behind her age, using youth as a shield from criticism. Professional troll Charlie Kirk added a charge of hypocrisy, since those same liberals who were supposedly claiming that you “can’t” criticize a 16-year-old also criticized a group of high school kids in January who were videotaped in MAGA hats acting like jackasses after an anti-choice protest in Washington.
The same people who say we can’t criticize 16-year old ANTIFA climate activist Greta Von Thunburg …Spent months shamelessly attacking the Covington Catholic High School kids—just because they supported our president 🤔 — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 23, 2019
This would be an argument, I guess, if anyone was actually assert a blanket “you can’t criticize kids” argument. In reality, criticizing the Covington students and supporting Greta Thunberg share a common assumption, which is the exact opposite of Kirk’s claim. In both cases, teenagers are fledgling moral actors, and, as such, deserve to be taken seriously when they make political statements.
In fact, there’s an entirely consistent argument here. The Covington were old enough to be held responsible for their actions. Greta Thunberg is old enough to be considered a rational actor whose arguments hold weight.
To put it another way, no one is saying you can’t criticize a teenager. But the “criticisms” of Thunberg are nothing more than ad hominem attacks and vitriol, thrown out there in a desperate attempt to hide the fact that the right has no substantive argument on the climate crisis.
We saw the right pulling the same trick with the Parkland kids, pretending that liberals were “using” the students for nefarious political purposes. In fact, young people are standing up on issues like climate and guns for the simple reason that they are the people most under threat.
Conservatives are, as usual, the ones being inconsistent here. When kids express right-wing views, they are assumed by conservatives to be responsible actors thinking for themselves. able to think for themselves. When they support progressive or liberal causes, they are accused of being puppets. The fairest response is to see both conservative and liberal kids as responsible for their own opinions, and to give credit or condemnation appropriately.
Ultimately, it’s good to see grown men so afraid of a teenage girl speaking truth to power. It’s a reminder that conservatives know, on some level, that their authority is a house of cards, and that they don’t deserve all the deference they get simply by being white, male or old. Thunberg represents the possibility of looking past rules that treat young women as inherently inferior and not worthy of respect. She demands that we take people’s arguments and beliefs seriously, instead of dismissing them based on perceptions rooted in identity. Conservatives understand one thing clearly —they will not do well in a world where what you say and do matters more than who you are.","['steely-eyed', 'courage', 'aggressive']"

How anti-vaxxers target grieving moms and turn them into crusaders against vaccines,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/how-anti-vaxxers-target-grieving-moms-turn-them-crusaders-n1057566,msnbc,vaccines,left,35.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Fifteen miles west of Minneapolis, a billboard looms over a field of tall grass beside Highway 55. The sign features a photo of Evee Clobes, a baby girl with sparkling eyes, flushed cheeks and an expression frozen in wonder. Next to her face are the words, ""HEALTHY BABIES DON'T JUST DIE."" The web address of a group opposed to mandatory vaccinations is at the bottom.
Since her death in March, Evee has served as a literal poster child for the anti-vaccination movement. Her face and chunky legs — adorned with Band-Aids from her shots — are featured on anti-vaccination websites and billboards. The story of her death is told at protests, read aloud at statehouses, and offered up by her mother and other activists as proof of the horror vaccines can bring.
Evee's story, as her mother Catelin Clobes tells it, is of a healthy 6-month-old who died 36 hours after a checkup where she got several vaccinations. Clobes and an army of online activists now say the vaccines caused Evee's death. That belief, and Clobes' willingness to make Evee part of a national media campaign, have turned the grieving mom into a rising star in the anti-vaccination world. Her Facebook posts draw hundreds of thousands of views, and multiple fundraisers set up by anti-vaccination activists on her behalf have raised tens of thousands of dollars. She has become a champion of other anti-vaccination parents around the country.
But there's a problem with the story at the heart of this crusade, and with Clobes' new role as an anti-vaccine heroine. Her local medical examiner has ruled that the evidence — collected in an autopsy and by first responders — shows Evee accidentally suffocated while co-sleeping with her mother.
Anti-vaccination activists have long targeted their message to parents of autistic kids. They have also, however, pursued another vulnerable population of parents searching for answers — mothers and fathers of babies who have died unexpectedly, especially when the deaths are linked to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS. At a time when the U.S. faces the largest outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses in decades, a network of activists is finding new recruits to the anti-vaccination cause by raising questions about the sudden deaths of several dozen babies and young children.
That network includes discredited physician-turned-anti-vaccination celebrity Andrew Wakefield, whose retracted study popularized the false belief that vaccines are linked to autism; Del Bigtree, a former ""Dr. Phil"" producer who runs the country's most well-funded anti-vaccine nonprofit, Informed Consent Action Network; and social media activist Larry Cook, who hosts the largest and most active anti-vaccination community on Facebook.
Since 2018, Cook has published at least 20 different articles alleging a baby's death was the result of a vaccination — despite official, medically supported explanations that include SIDS, pneumonia and accidental asphyxiation. Clobes joined Cook's group after Evee died, and her story is among Cook's 20.
Stories like Evee's are ""incredibly common and very effective,"" said Naomi Smith, a lecturer at Federation University Australia who has studied the anti-vaccination movement. ""Anti-vaccination communities have long favored this type of personal testimony to get their message across. These stories are also presented as being more meaningful and more 'real' than official statistics.""
""They [hit] that core fear parents have about keeping their children safe,"" Smith added.
And as public health officials work to contain outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and social media platforms crack down on vaccine misinformation, Clobes serves another purpose for the anti-vaccination community. Testimonies like hers don't just drive billions of views to anti-vaccination websites or raise millions for the cause, they also provide a kind of human shield. Who wants to pick a fight with a grieving mother?
How Evee's story spread
Catelin Clobes spent the night of Feb. 28 as she did most others — with Evee. Clobes breastfed Evee to sleep and set her down in the queen bed they shared, according to the Wright County Sheriff's report. Clobes then had a whiskey cocktail, watched some basketball and, a few hours later, lay down beside Evee, according to the report.
When Clobes woke up the next morning, Evee didn't stir and she was cold to the touch, Clobes told investigators.
Distraught, Clobes called 911. ""This can't be real,"" Clobes told the operator, according to a transcript of the call. ""This is because she was sleeping with me.""
According to reports by a detective who examined Evee at the scene and the medical examiner who performed Evee's autopsy, the skin on Evee's face had creases that looked like they could have come from a blanket. Areas of her nose, chest, arms and legs were discolored and pooled with blood, indicating Evee had been face-down for some time.
The medical examiner initially found the cause of death to be ""undetermined,"" with co-sleeping with an adult as a ""significant condition."" Three months later, at Clobes' request, the same examiner reviewed the case and amended the cause of death to positional asphyxia, or suffocation.
""There are no scene or autopsy findings and no scientific literature to support vaccination as a cause of, or contributor to, Evee's death,"" the Wright County medical examiner, Dr. A. Quinn Strobl, wrote in a June letter explaining the official change to Clobes.
Clobes rejected these findings in an interview with NBC News.
""I safely co-slept with my daughter, that has nothing to do with her death,"" she said via Facebook Messenger.
The day after Evee died — before the medical examiner had issued any findings — Clobes started pouring out her heartbreak and confusion on Facebook.
""This feeling of pain is indescribable,"" Clobes wrote next to a video of Evee laughing that has now been viewed over half a million times and attracted 3,000 comments. ""The unanswered questions of how or why make it worse.""
Clobes' grief and Evee's giggle were like a siren, attracting dozens of family and friends, and then hundreds and thousands of strangers offering condolences in the comments.
Within hours of her post, some had answers.
""Vaccine injury is real and a movement is spreading across the nation,"" one woman wrote. ""Organizations are filled with people and parents who understand what you are going through and can help offer guidance and support to you.""
Some posters added links to Stop Mandatory Vaccination, a website founded by Larry Cook, a man without medical training who has made a name as a leader of the online anti-vaccination movement.
The links posted to Clobes' timeline were testimonials and interviews featuring mothers who suggested their children had been irreparably injured or killed by vaccines, pages that make up the most popular and engaged-with section of Cook's site.
Within a week of her daughter’s death, Catelin Clobes joined Larry Cook’s Stop Mandatory Vaccination Facebook group. via Facebook
Cook's isn't the only site to publish these stories, though its posts are the most widely shared. Other websites, including Vaccine Choice Prayer Community and Circle of Mamas, post similar allegations.

Since 2015, Cook has made a business out of the anti-vaccination narratives of distressed parents. He has raised over $100,000 through multiple GoFundMe campaigns and then via other platforms after GoFundMe banned him in March. Cook has his own Amazon storefront, where he promotes anti-vaccine books and films, taking a cut of the sales, and raises an unknown amount through his website, accepting donations through PayPal that ""go directly to me,"" according to his website.
""I and I alone decide how to use the funds,"" says the site. Cook says the money has funded anti-vaccine ads, advocacy and ""secret projects."" He's currently weighing the launch of a dating site for people with anti-vaccine views. Cook did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Clobes seemed open to the anti-vaccine messages aimed at her. A day after her initial post, she was attaching updates, urging others with stories of health scares after infant vaccinations to get in touch.
Within a week of her daughter's death, Clobes had joined Stop Mandatory Vaccination's 169,000-member closed Facebook group, filed a report with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the federal government's vaccine safety surveillance program, and retained a lawyer. The Stop Mandatory Vaccination website published an article about Clobes.
The next week, a local activist helped Clobes set up a fundraiser through GoFundMe with the goal of raising $5,000 for a ""private autopsy"" and other expenses related to Clobes' quest for answers. (Clobes has received more than $22,000 and has raised the goal to $40,000.)
For the autopsy — more precisely, a study of tissue samples retained by Wright County — Clobes' lawyer hired Dr. Douglas Miller, a clinical professor of pathology at the University of Missouri and one of the few mainstream medical professionals anti-vaccination activists seem to respect. He has served as an expert witness for parents who filed lawsuits claiming vaccines triggered SIDS in their children. Clobes said on social media that Miller would be doing the study.
Miller, who charges $500 per hour to evaluate a vaccine injury claim case, confirmed to NBC News that he completed an evaluation for Clobes in July.
Miller said his investigation found no evidence that vaccines had contributed to Evee's death. He said he told Clobes of his conclusion, and had declined to support her case in the federal government's National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, known more commonly as Vaccine Court. He declined to name the factors that led to his decision, citing concern for Clobes' privacy.
Online, however, Clobes claimed Dr. Miller's report offered ""proof"" that Evee had suffered ""a cellular infiltration triggered by an immune response from the vaccinations.""
In an email to NBC News, Miller said the neuropathologist Clobes referred to ""was not me, if he or she actually exists.""
""I did not tell Ms. Clobes of any such finding,"" Miller said, ""and I did not provide her or her attorney with any report which alleged any such finding.""
When asked about Miller's statements, Clobes directed questions to her lawyer, who did not return multiple requests for comment.
Clobes continued, and expanded, her advocacy after receiving Miller's report. In August, she registered the Justice For Evee Organization as a nonprofit in Minnesota and began soliciting donations. Through her website, Clobes also sells Evee-themed merchandise, including T-shirts, bumper stickers and pins, with proceeds slated to go to anti-vaccine advocacy in Minnesota and beyond.

But Clobes isn't just telling her own story. She's using her growing platform to circulate the stories of other families who claim vaccines killed their babies. Since Evee's death, Clobes has posted on Facebook about seven other babies who unexpectedly died, tagging their mothers, and sharing the story with her followers, who now number more than 11,000. She started GoFundMe campaigns for two of the mothers.
A separate Evee-branded campaign was launched by Health Choice Minnesota, the local arm of American Citizens for Health Choice, a national anti-vaccine organization that raised nearly half a million dollars from 2012 to 2017, according to federal tax returns. Health Choice Minnesota paid for two Evee billboards outside Minneapolis, and the signs steer onlookers to the group's website, which has a donate option ""to fund legal fees as well as public education & support campaigns.""
A representative for Health Choice Minnesota declined to answer questions about the money raised by the Evee campaign. ""We confirmed the details and provided support,"" said the representative via Facebook. ""Every family deserves respect and support after the loss of a loved one.""
Health Choice's founder, anti-vaccination advocate and state Republican Party finance chair Jennifer Larson, also co-founded the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota, which made news earlier this year for promoting anti-vaccination theories among the local Somali-American population. Larson did not respond to a request for comment.
In September, Clobes appeared on nationally known anti-vaccination advocate Del Bigtree's online talk show, ""The HighWire."" Clobes hinted she might sue the Wright County medical examiner over a ""cover-up."" Bigtree interspersed his interview with Clobes with home videos of Evee and a re-enactment of her death.
In an interview with NBC News, Bigtree dismissed the suggestion that claims like Clobes' deserve extra scrutiny.
""All I'm doing is letting her tell her story,"" said Bigtree, whose nonprofit brought in $1.4 million in revenue in 2017— more than any comparable group. He compared his work to media coverage of the #MeToo movement, in which women have made sexual assault allegations against powerful men. ""Are we not supposed to listen to the women?""
Over Facebook Messenger, Clobes said she came to her beliefs on her own and wants others to do the same.
""I'm not out on this big 'anti-vaxx' wagon, to deceive people,"" she wrote. ""I'm just telling my truth. What happened to my daughter. How much I loved her. How much this has broken me.""
'I just want the truth out there'
Evee isn't the first baby whose face has been enlisted in the anti-vaccination cause. Nicholas Catone, a 20-month-old who died in 2017, was featured in a 30-billboard campaign last year from Learn The Risk, a California-based national nonprofit that claims to expose the risks of vaccines. His parents are unsatisfied with the official finding of a ""sudden, unexplained death,"" and instead blame a vaccine given three weeks earlier.
Sometimes, a baby becomes a face of the movement without both parents' consent.
Mark Cooney, 30, lost his daughter, Sophia, in February.
Cooney describes Sophia as a happy 2-month-old, with her mother's blue eyes and sandy blond hair. The night Sophia died, Cooney came home from work to find his girlfriend and Sophia's mother, Laura Stanard, asleep on the couch in their Fort Collins, Colorado, apartment. He called 911 when he saw his daughter.

Sophia was ""found in a supine position,"" with her head ""pushed into an area between two cushions"" on the couch, the Larimer County coroner's report reads.
Cooney told NBC News that Stanard ""pulled Sophia from in between her and the cushion but the baby was purple and limp.""
Cooney performed CPR, but neither he nor paramedics could revive Sophia. She was pronounced dead at the hospital.
Sophia's death was an accident, caused by ""asphyxiation due to being in a compromised position while co-sleeping,"" according to the coroner's report. ""The mother breastfed her on a sofa, and unfortunately fell asleep with her still in her arms.""
According to the police report of the incident, a detective ""asked Laura what she thought happened and Laura said she believed Sophia suffocated against the back of the couch. Laura said this was her fault because she fell asleep with her. Laura began to cry.""
In the report, the detective wrote that Stanard said she had smoked marijuana that morning and afternoon, which is legal in Colorado. The detective wrote that a doctor consulted about the incident said the use of alcohol or marijuana ""would make co-sleeping unsafe.""
After Sophia's death, Cooney said he couldn't work. He and Stanard broke up, and soon after, Cooney moved to Las Vegas, then back home to Nebraska.
On the six-month anniversary of Sophia's death, Cooney saw that a stranger named Catie Clobes had posted a GoFundMe campaign to Facebook, asking for donations to help Stanard with ""bills and expenses"" after Sophia's death. Sophia is one of six babies in as many months whose deaths, without medical evidence, Clobes has promoted to her 10,000 followers and various Facebook groups as vaccine-related. Articles about Sophia soon followed on websites like Stop Mandatory Vaccination, which posted the story with the headline, ""Infant Dies 14 Hours After Receiving 8 Vaccines."" The article is one of the site's most popular this year, getting some 57,000 Facebook likes, comments and shares, according to a Buzzsumo analysis.
When he saw the posts, Cooney said: ""I couldn't breathe. It's like someone was making a mockery of my precious little Sophie.""
Cooney asked Stanard, Clobes and then GoFundMe to take down Sophia's campaign, and when those requests were ignored, he contacted the Fort Collins police, who opened an investigation into the GoFundMe account. After Cooney, friends and family loaded the campaign's comment section with complaints, it was taken down, having raised just $225. No charges were filed.
Stanard said in a brief conversation over Facebook Messenger that she had approached Clobes after seeing her story on Facebook. ""I chose to reach out because who wouldn't reach out to someone who went through the same thing?"" Stanard said. ""Everyone just wants to find someone to relate to and I finally found someone who actually believed me.""
Cooney doesn't blame his ex for convincing herself that vaccines killed Sophia, but he is angry just the same.
""I just want the truth out there: Babies asphyxiate, this happens,"" Cooney said. ""These anti-vaccination people are continuously contacting parents who have lost children, giving them false information and false hope. This stuff is wrong.""
'Where's the proof?'
Clobes calls Evee a ""superhero"" for her posthumous role in the anti-vaccine movement. On her Facebook page, Clobes posts screenshots of messages from parents who, she says, have seen her story and been persuaded not to vaccinate their children. The Catones post similar images along with the hashtag #onestarfishatatime, a reference to an inspirational story in which a boy, faced with a beach of dying starfish, saves as many as he can, one by one.
While it's impossible to measure the impact of these stories on vaccination rates or public opinion, it's safe to say they've been seen and shared millions of times.
The overwhelming majority of parents in the United States vaccinate their children, but a growing number do not. This hesitancy has contributed to the biggest resurgence of measles in decades, leading public health officials to sound the alarm and counter online vaccine misinformation with their own message: Multiple studies and scientific reviews have shown that while serious reactions from vaccines are possible, they are extremely rare. Grieving parents may believe vaccines caused their baby’s death, but the timing is often a coincidence, since any baby who dies would likely have been vaccinated recently.
The latest venue for Evee's story has been California, where anti-vaccination activists have been protesting legislation that closed medical exemption loopholes in the state's vaccine law. This month, Clobes posted in opposition to the bill, sharing a photo of Evee in her casket alongside a claim that there's been ""a huge cover-up"" surrounding her death.
Last week, California state Sen. Richard Pan, a pediatrician who led the bill's push, got into a Twitter spat with the actor Rob Schneider, who argued against the legislation by sharing Clobes' post.
""Catie has my sympathy for the loss of her daughter Evee,"" Pan replied to Schneider on Twitter. ""Blaming her death on vaccination requires proof.""
Pan's remarks were seized on as heartless by Clobes' supporters, who accused him of attacking a grieving mother.
But Pan, who has been harassed, physically assaulted and most recently targeted by an anti-vaccination advocate who poured a red liquid on the California Senate floor, says sympathy shouldn't trump science when it comes to decisions that can affect public health.
""It's one thing for a family to say, 'My child died,'"" Pan told NBC News. ""But when you say, ""It was caused by vaccines, and now I want to change laws or stop laws in a way that will hurt children,' then it's not inappropriate to say: 'Where's the proof?'""","['target', 'crusaders', 'anti-vaxxers']"
"If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-brutalizing-protesters-would-save-him-he-was-wrong/,alternet,elections-2020,left,35.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['war', 'threatened', 'damage']"

"Some people have expressed concern that full cancellation could reward wealthier—and whiter—people, who are less in need than others. But full cancellation will reduce the racial wealth gap. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/06/bernie-got-it-right-full-student-debt-cancellation-is-the-best-approach/,alternet,student-debt,left,35.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, together with Representatives Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal, has introduced a dramatic reform package on college affordability. It goes far beyond anything proposed so far, both in its scope and in its potential to reshape the way Americans think about their society and government.
One bill in the package, Rep. Omar’s Student Debt Cancellation Act, would cancel all outstanding student debt. That’s a $1.6 trillion burden affecting more than 45 million people. This bill will benefit people in all demographic groups, communities, and walks of life. That fact is illustrated by the fact that, as Sen. Sanders introduces the bill in the Senate, eight representatives of color (including Rep. Omar) will simultaneously introduce it in the House.
The reform package also includes Sen. Sanders’ College for All Act, which provides tuition-free higher education to every qualified American without any additional work requirements, restrictions, or tests for family financial eligibility.
An Unfair Deal
Both ideas are transformative. But, of the two proposals, it is student debt cancellation that’s likely to trigger the most vigorous debate. That’s a good thing, because it can lead to both a teaching moment and an opportunity for reflection.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for partial student debt cancellation began a productive national conversation. But the Omar/Sanders proposal, with its full and universal cancellation for tens of millions of people trapped by student debt, gives us an opportunity: to re-examine our social contract, our awareness of the public good, and our fundamental ideas about equity and fairness.
Some people’s first response to the idea of canceling all student debt is to think that it’s a step too far. Why not just cancel part of the debt, for some of the debt holders, as Sen. Warren’s proposal does? Freedom to Prosper, an activist group that was instrumental in laying the groundwork for full debt cancellation*, offers useful data and analysis on the benefits of full cancellation on its website.
But the most important argument for full cancellation is a moral one. Low-cost or tuition-free higher education was available for many years in the United States, in many parts of the country. A series of public policy choices shifted this cost onto individual students, who were promised that their “investment” would pay off in higher earnings.
Neither the policy change nor the promise was fair to students or their families. It was wrong to shift society’s shared responsibility of educating its citizens onto individuals. And it was wrong to make them a promise that, as we now know, never came true. As Julie Margetta Morgan and Marshall Steinbaum wrote for the Roosevelt Institute, “More education has not led to higher earnings over time.”
A Plan for Everyone
President Obama put it well in his final State of the Union address when he said, “No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.” Partial cancellation would leave millions trapped in the red for the foreseeable future.
Some people have expressed concern that full cancellation could reward wealthier—and whiter—people, who are less in need than others. But full cancellation will reduce the racial wealth gap. Economist Marshall Steinbaum concluded that the elimination of all student debt would reduce that gap in younger households from a 12:1 advantage for whites to 5:1—a ratio that is still unconscionably and immorally high, and must be addressed by other policies. But this figure shows that full cancellation lessens the harm. When taken as a whole, this college affordability reform package is likely to significantly improve racial injustice in our economy.
In that case, why not target the program to lower-income people, as Warren’s plan would? First, because truly wealthy people don’t generally have student debt. They write checks for college tuition. If they become wealthy after graduation, their financial advisers will almost certainly tell them to pay off student debt in full. After all, student debt terms are far less favorable than those available to “high net worth individuals.”
Why cancel debt for everyone? First, because many of us have long believed those things we hold most precious—our parks, our security, and our access to knowledge—should be freely available to all. These borrowers were denied that access. That’s an historical injustice we should make right.
Secondly, everyone who holds student debt has been wronged by our country’s shift away from tuition-free public education, and by the false promises that accompanied that shift.
Making it right will benefit more than the 45 million borrowers and their families. A report from the Levy Institute showed that full student debt cancellation will create more than a million jobs, and significant economic growth, over a period of several years.
That number becomes considerably smaller, by hundreds of thousands of jobs, under a limited plan like Sen. Warren’s. In effect, the limited program deprives thousands of blue-collar Americans of jobs they would otherwise have under full cancellation. That’s a price they shouldn’t have to pay, especially if it’s motivated by an exaggerated fear that somehow, somewhere, a well-to-do orthodontist is getting a break she doesn’t deserve.
The Policy and the Politics
The politics of this issue are compelling. Polling on full cancellation is surprisingly strong, as seen in a recent survey conducted by Data for Progress (DFP) and published by Freedom to Prosper. And full cancellation, of the kind proposed by Rep. Omar and Sen. Sanders, helps more people. In general, the broader the population affected by policies—in this case, by full cancellation and tuition-free higher education—the larger the “army” willing to fight for them.
These proposals also benefit from their simplicity. Democrats, as is well known, tend to over-engineer their policies. They make you, in the words of an old Godfather joke, an offer you can’t understand.
In the case of student debt cancellation, they also force people to make painful choices: Does a young couple put off getting married to get their student debt reduced? Do they wait another year before taking good jobs, so that they qualify? Must a struggling young person stay away from his parents’ home and couch-surf for a year to obtain the benefit?
Conclusion
The clear and simple structure of this plan will make it easier to explain to the public. It will help more people, and it will help them more thoroughly. And it will give progressives the opportunity to remind Americans of a time when the country understood the value of the public good—when it was understood that the government looked to unite society through common investment in, and benefit from, publicly provided goods and services.
There may be pushback among Democrats. If so, I hope the ones doing the pushing will reconsider. We have treated our younger generations, and many older people, unjustly. The act of recognizing an injustice we hadn’t seen before makes us more human and refines us as moral beings.
This moral context, along with the inexorable mathematics of social and economic justice, makes the Omar/Sanders bill an important and profound proposal that deserves broad support.

It’s been about two months since the New York Times published a striking portrait of a Guatemalan immigrant named Victorina Morales, who entered the United States illegally many years ago, and in 2013, began working at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump assured voters he hadn’t hired “illegal immigrants.” Morales wanted the world to know that wasn’t true.
At first, this looked like a story about a brave woman, coming forward despite the risks to her personally, and a craven politician, exploiting anti-immigrant animus to advance his ambitions, despite his own personal record on the issue. But as regular readers know, it wasn’t long before it became clear that Morales’ experiences are part of a larger controversy.
Indeed, that original NYT report suggested that the management at Trump’s club in New Jersey was well aware of the fact that it employed undocumented immigrants, and it deliberately took steps to obscure the fact that it broke the law – repeatedly, over the course of several years.
The scope of the issue is still coming into focus. The Washington Post reported overnight:
President Trump’s company has fired at least 18 undocumented workers from five golf courses in New York and New Jersey in the past two months, part of a purge set in motion after a series of reports about the clubs’ employment of workers without legal status. Eric Trump, the president’s son, confirmed the firings to The Washington Post on Monday. Those dismissed included three undocumented workers at the Trump National Golf Club Colts Neck near Montrose, N.J., and three more at the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia in Pine Hill, N.J. Another was dismissed from Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley in Hopewell Junction, N.Y…. There have also been firings at the Trump course in Bedminster, N.J., which his son did not address.
It’s worth emphasizing that these figures came by way of Eric Trump, not independent sources. What’s more, the dismissal of these undocumented workers is the result of a recent audit, and it’s possible the number of firings may yet grow.
The timing of these revelations could be better for the president.
Donald Trump is, after all, leading an aggressive campaign against illegal immigration, even as we learn about his business having hired quite a few immigrants who are in the United States illegally.
The scope and scale of the problem is striking in its own right, and it’s equally amazing that Trump’s business waited until the third year of Trump’s presidency to address the issue.
But let’s also not forget that the story may yet advance further. A recent Washington Post report noted that Trump’s Bedminster club has drawn “scrutiny” from federal and state investigators, who are examining the venue’s employment practices.
The article added that the materials collected thus far “indicate that investigators may be launching a probe into the hiring practices of the president’s golf club.”","['deliberately', 'obscure', 'repeatedly']"
"The result was a mess: car manufacturers, which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, faced the prospect of having to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/blow-trump-auto-manufacturers-reach-deal-california,msnbc,environment,left,36.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"When it comes to pollution standards, this isn’t the news the Trump administration wanted to see.
Four automakers from three continents have struck a deal with California to produce more fuel-efficient cars for their U.S. fleets in coming years, undercutting one of the Trump administration’s most aggressive climate policy rollbacks. The compromise between the California Air Resources Board and Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America came after weeks of secret negotiations and could shape future U.S. vehicle production, even as White House officials aim to relax gas mileage standards for the nation’s cars, pickup trucks and SUVs.
While the original plan involved Trump administration officials negotiating with California, some of the leading auto manufacturers ended up quietly going around the White House and talking to Sacramento directly. Now, as the Washington Post’s report added, the industry is hoping the administration will join the deal it failed to negotiate.
If you’re new to this story, let’s review how we got here. To address the climate crisis, the Obama administration created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.
Manufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.
Then Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.
The president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. What the White House didn’t anticipate was the fact that auto manufacturers concluded that Trump’s anti-climate plans went too far.
In fact, in early June, most of the industry urged the administration to change course, because its plan would produce “untenable” instability.
Why? Because Trump’s plan to gut pollution safeguards was so drastic that many states announced plans to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.
That includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.
The result was a mess: car manufacturers, which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy, faced the prospect of having to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.
Not surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.
The White House briefly tried to work out a deal with California, with the intention of creating national standards that everyone could live with. Those talks failed and the administration broke off negotiations with California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and his team months ago.
And so, manufacturers decided to open a dialog of their own with the Golden State, which now appears to have produced results.
There’s clearly a lot of work left to be done, in part because of the car companies that weren’t part of the talks – today’s deal covers roughly a third of the industry – and in part because the administration may very well move forward with its plan, regardless of the new agreement.
In terms of the specifics, these are the top-line numbers to keep in mind:
* Obama plan: fleets would average ~52 miles-per-gallon by 2025
* Newly negotiated California plan: fleets would average ~51 miles-per-gallon by 2026
* Trump plan: fleets would continue to average 37 miles-per-gallon, freezing the status quo indefinitely
It’s worth emphasizing that the auto manufacturers are partly responsible for the disarray: they asked the Trump administration for a break on the Obama-era standards. But by most accounts, they expected the Republican White House to tweak the policy, not kill it. Now the companies are scrambling to put things right.

"But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-brutalizing-protesters-would-save-him-he-was-wrong/,alternet,elections-2020,left,36.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.
That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.
This isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.
Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.
Even before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.
The Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)
Trump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.
In this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.
A president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.
This is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.
Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.
Any normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.
He has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.
Across the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?
And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.
The message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.
Trump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.
Meanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.
In one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.","['quack', 'unbridled', 'buffoonery']"
"The New York Times recently published a fairly detailed fact-check of these Trump World arguments that democrats don’t mind executing babies after birth, and not surprisingly, the rhetoric is irresponsibly wrong.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-line-abortion-becomes-even-more-incendiary,msnbc,abortion,left,37.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Last week, the House Judiciary Committee moved forward with plans for an expansive investigation into Trump World abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release a rather intemperate press statement.
The congressional investigation, Donald Trump’s chief spokesperson said, is intended to “distract” the public from the Democratic agenda – which she said includes “killing babies after they’re born.”
In other words, according to the White House press secretary, Democrats support murdering children.
Yesterday, Sanders went a little further. Asked about the virtues of possibly lowering the rhetorical temperature in D.C., the president’s chief spokesperson decided to do the opposite.
“Look, I think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable of coming together and agreeing on the fact that they’re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother’s womb or killing a baby after birth.”
The use of the word “comfortable” was of particular interest – as if Democrats agree with the White House press secretary’s incendiary rhetoric.
This comes just two weeks after Donald Trump declared via Twitter, “The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth.”
The New York Times recently published a fairly detailed fact-check of these kinds of arguments, and not surprisingly, the rhetoric from Trump World is irresponsibly wrong.
But it’s also a recipe for heightened tensions and conflict. What are the prospects of cooperative governing at the federal level when the White House accuses its rivals of being pro-infanticide?
For that matter, how concerned should the public be about the White House creating potentially violent conditions with over-the-top rhetoric likely to fuel angry reactions from Trump’s far-right base?","['irresponsibly', 'wrong', 'executing', 'babies']"
As the ranks of Democratic Party 2020 presidential hopefuls continue to swell and Trump’s chaotic lawlessness proliferates it’s easy to miss a deepening crisis that’s already taking a toll on millions of households and is about to get much worse.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/05/the-real-moral-hazard-is-ignoring-the-student-debt-crisis-and-its-devastating-effect-on-the-economy/,alternet,student-debt,left,37.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As the ranks of Democratic Party 2020 presidential hopefuls continue to swell and Trump’s chaotic lawlessness proliferates it’s easy to miss a deepening crisis that’s already taking a toll on millions of households and is about to get much worse.
It has metastasized way beyond a talking point on a candidate’s laundry list. Left unaddressed it will consign generations to poverty, further accelerate wealth and income disparity and knee-cap the nation’s economic prospects as even fewer adults can afford to form a family.
Student debt that was at $521 billion in 2006, has now spiked to $1.57 trillion, more than a 200 percent increase. That puts it second only to the nation’s aggregate mortgage debt and a half-trillion more than America’s total credit card bill.
According to the Urban Institute, every fiscal quarter another 250,000 student borrowers see their loans go into default, that’s one million a year. Currently, 11.5 percent of the nation’s student loans are in default but the Urban Institute is projecting by 2023, in just four years, that default rate will approach a near catastrophic 40 percent.
A college loan default becomes even more ruinous when the student drops out before getting a degree. Currently, 56 percent of students drop-out by year six. At that point, a young adult life is economically underwater since dropouts earn 35 percent less, that’s an average $21,000 less a year, than their classmates that persevered to graduation are earning.
In many ways, this deepening crisis builds on the Great Recession when Americans lost $20 trillion in household wealth. That erosion of an economic foundation that had taken generations to build and its harvesting by Wall Street was most keenly felt by African-Americans.
Now, the data shows there is an aftershock in the form of the looming tsunami of student debt defaults that will hit communities of color the hardest, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics and Demos, a progressive think tank.
“Not only are students of color more likely to borrow more for a degree, and borrow in higher amounts for the same degree, but they’re more likely to struggle to repay student loans than white students,” Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst for Demos told Student Loan Hero. “Students of color are also overrepresented at for-profit colleges and universities which account for a very large proportion of student loan defaults.”
“Among black students who started school in 2003, one in two defaulted on student loans within the following 12 years,” reported Student Loan Hero.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Jerome Powell testified that it was “not something you can pick up in the data right now” but, he added, the student debt overhang casts a real shadow over the nation’s economic future.
“You do stand to see longer-term negative effects on people who can’t pay off their student loans. It hurts their credit rating, it impacts the entire half of their economic life,” Powell testified. “As this goes on and as student loans continue to grow and become larger and larger, then it absolutely could hold back growth.”
“As young adults struggle to pay back their loans, they’re forced to make financial concessions that create a drag on the economy,” reported Bloomberg. “Student debt has delayed household formation and led to a decline in home-ownership. Sixteen percent of young workers age 25 to 35 lived with their parents in 2017, up four percent from 10 years prior, shows Bloomberg Intelligence.”
But this is not just exclusively an issue for twenty- or thirty- somethings. Thanks to former Vice President Joe Biden, who as Delaware’s Senator did the banks’ bidding and made student debt non-dischargeable via bankruptcy, no generation escapes the student loan indenture.
It’s a predatory policy that even a conservative like Powell was hard-pressed to explain in his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. “Alone among all kinds of debt, we don’t allow student loan debt to be discharged in bankruptcy,” Powell testified. “I’d be at a loss to explain why that should be the case.”
In February the Wall Street Journal reported that Americans over 60 were saddled with $86 billion in student loan deb, a spike of 161 percent from 2010 and 2017.
Often the loans were the result of either borrowing for their children’s education or borrowing they racked up to put themselves through college or graduate school.
The Journal reported that a few years back the government resorted to attaching social security benefits and income tax refunds belonging to 40,000 seniors 65 or older for loan repayment, more than a three-fold increase 362 percent just ten years ago.
According to research by the Interdisciplinary Association for Population Health Science there are millions of parents too young to retire with little set aside, but who have taken on substantial borrowing for their children’s education.
“Meanwhile, the average near-retirement household has only about $12,000 in retirement savings, indicating that they are unprepared not only for retirement, but also for unexpected financial shocks,” wrote Dr. Katrina Walsemann, Director of Health Promotion, Education, and Behavior at the University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health. “Add more debt to these households, and parents may find themselves suffering undue financial stress. The potential negative impact of such stress is well documented, particularly as it relates to psychological well-being.”
She continues, “For example, financial debt has been linked to poorer mental health, greater anxiety, and shorter sleep.
Perhaps equally pressing are the health-related economic trade-offs that parents may make as they transition to retirement and fixed incomes. Paying down student loans may force parents to choose, for instance, between paying their loan and paying for medication or even food.”
Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren released a $1.25 trillion proposal to cancel most student loan debt and provide tuition-free public college.
Under her proposal up to $50,000 in student loan debt would be zeroed out for every person with a household income of less than $100,000 and borrowers with incomes between $100,000 and $250,000 would be eligible for some college debt relief.
“This touches people’s lives,” Ms. Warren told the New York Times in an interview. “This is a chance to talk about what’s broken and how we fix it. This is the American dream.”
In her first-person post on Medium Warren recounted her own experience pursuing higher education in a time and place when “tuition was just $50 a semester” and got her degree enabling her to become a teacher for students with special needs.
“Higher education opened a million doors for me,” she wrote.
“It’s how the daughter of a janitor in a small town in Oklahoma got to become a teacher, a law school professor, a U.S. Senator, and eventually, a candidate for President of the United States.”
But she rightly notes it is “virtually impossible for a young person to find that kind of opportunity.”
Up until now, any call for serious consideration of student debt relief has been drowned out by the voices of those who paid off their student loans and see the delinquency of others as a sign of the debtor’s moral defect. And, as with any multi-billion-dollar meltdown, there’s plenty of blame to go around.
Yet, as she often does so well, Warren flags the systemic failures that are the real drivers of the crisis.
“As states have invested less per-student at community colleges and public four-year colleges, the schools themselves have raised tuition and fees to make up the gap,” Warren wrote. “And rather than stepping in to hold states accountable, or to pick up more of the tab and keep costs reasonable, the federal government went with a third option: pushing families that can’t afford to pay the outrageous costs of higher education towards taking out loans”.
And she recounts how every step of the way was determined by public policy choices co-opted by monied interests that bought our politics.
“We got into this crisis because state governments and the federal government decided that instead of treating higher education like our public-school system — free and accessible to all Americans — they’d rather cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations and offload the cost of higher education onto students and their families. The student debt crisis is the direct result of this failed experiment.”
In response to Warren’s proposal the editorial board of the Los Angeles Daily News warned that her proposal risked “moral hazard” by encouraging current students to “borrow as much as you can and wait for the debt to be canceled during the next presidential primary campaign.”
Hmm. When did we last hear about the dreaded perils of “moral hazard?”
As it turns out Warren’s proposal is a veritable bargain compared to the $14.4 trillion dollars it cost for the Bush-Obama Wall Street bailout.","['lawlessness', 'proliferates', 'chaotic', 'crisis']"
"Indeed, just this week, Donald Trump, who once said the climate crisis was a hoax concocted by the Chinese, marveled at cold temperatures throughout the Midwest, convinced that the frigid weather is evidence of … something.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-national-security-team-rejects-his-climate-stance-too,msnbc,environment,left,37.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Some of the nation’s top officials on national security – including the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of the FBI and the CIA – testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday, and shared fairly sensible observations on many of the United States’ most serious threats. Unfortunately for the White House, those assessments were wholly at odds with practically everything Donald Trump has said on the same subjects.
The list wasn’t short. The top U.S. officials contradicted Trump on ISIS. And North Korea. And Iran. And border security. And Russian election interference. At times yesterday, it seemed the top national security officials and the president were serving in entirely different administrations.
But there was another issue that may have been lost in the shuffle yesterday, which Yahoo News highlighted.
In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that climate change remains a national security threat. “Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond,” Coats said in the U.S. Intelligence Community’s annual “Worldwide Threat Assessment” report. “Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security. Coats added: “Extreme weather events, many worsened by accelerating sea level rise, will particularly affect urban coastal areas in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Damage to communication, energy, and transportation infrastructure could affect low-lying military bases, inflict economic costs, and cause human displacement and loss of life.”
This comes just two weeks after Trump’s Defense Department issued a related report, noting that climate change is a global security threat.
All of which serves as an important reminder: the president isn’t just ignoring scientists and related policy experts; he’s also ignoring his own administration.
Indeed, just this week, Donald Trump, who once said the climate crisis was a hoax concocted by the Chinese, marveled at cold temperatures throughout the Midwest, convinced that the frigid weather is evidence of … something.
“What the hell is going on with Global Waming?” the American president wrote. “Please come back fast, we need you!”
Yes, he called it global “waming.” Maybe it was a typo, maybe Trump’s sense of humor is indecipherable.
In either case, if the profoundly confused Republican wants to understand what’s “going on” with the ongoing environmental catastrophe, he apparently need only reach out to top officials in his own administration.","['crisis', 'hoax', 'marveled']"
"When did vaccines become politicized? Amid a measles outbreak, suddenly Republicans support anti-vaxxers.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/when-did-vaccines-become-politicized-amid-a-measles-outbreak-suddenly-republicans-support-anti-vaxxers/,alternet,vaccines,left,38.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Republicans are opposing Democratic legislative efforts to tighten childhood vaccination laws across the country despite a rising number of measles outbreaks around the United States.
Bills to restrict exemptions for immunizations passed through legislative committees in Washington, Colorado and Maine this month without a single Republican supporter, Politico reports. Washington is currently dealing with one of the biggest measles outbreaks in the country. Democratic lawmakers are seeking to limit immunization exemptions on religious and philosophical grounds.
Republicans in New York, New Jersey and Arizona are also opposing Democratic-sponsored bills that would make it harder for parents to get exemptions from vaccinating their kids. Republicans in Mississippi and West Virginia have instead introduced bills that would expand vaccine exemptions in those states, Politico reported.
Congressional Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky have also come out against mandatory vaccines. While there are certainly those on the left who oppose vaccines, like activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaxxer movement has been heavily criticized by Democrats while being praised by President Trump. Trump wanted Kennedy to lead a White House commission on vaccine safety before ultimately scrapping the plan, Kennedy told The Daily Beast.
Though Trump has not been as outspoken on vaccines as president as he was in the past, he has repeatedly falsely suggested that vaccines cause autism. “Massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism,” he wrote in 2012. “Autism WAY UP — I believe in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots. Too much for small child to handle. Govt. should stop NOW!” he wrote in 2014.
Officials are worried they are “three Trump tweets away” from the issue becoming even more polarized, according to MIT political scientist Adam Berinsky.
“There’s a credulity gap between the parties in regard to science that wasn’t there 25 years ago,” Berinsky told Politico, which noted that right-wing media figures like Tucker Carlson, Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones have voiced skepticism about vaccinations. At least three Republican gubernatorial candidates publicly voiced skepticism about immunizations on the campaign trail in 2018.
In the past, the government acted swiftly when faced with measles outbreaks like the kind we are seeing now. In 1972, officials barred unvaccinated children from school during a measles epidemic. The move was seen as a success and led to efforts around the country to implement stricter vaccine laws. The federal government also responded swiftly after 89 people, mostly children, died in a measles epidemic in 1990. The government spent millions to provide vaccines to poor communities and the disease stopped circulating in the United States within 10 years. Every case since 2000 has been linked to overseas travelers who infected unvaccinated Americans who then spread the virus to others.
Some experts worry that a government response in the current political climate could do more harm than good.
“My concern is that tightening requirements through the political process risks politicizing an issue that we can’t allow to be politicized if we’re going to maintain public health,” University of Michigan political scientist Brendan Nyhan told Politico.
Many Republicans have said they support vaccinations but oppose government mandates to require them. Other Republicans have rejected the idea that anti-vaxxers should be able to put others at risk as a matter of personal liberty.
Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is a physician, hit out at Paul’s claims that requiring children to be vaccinated to attend school would violate personal liberty for the “false sense of security” at a hearing last month. (In fairness, Paul is himself an ophthalmologist.)
“I have seen people who have not been vaccinated … who have ended up with terrible diseases for no other reason than they did not understand vaccination was important,” Cassidy said, later adding, “The requirement is just that you cannot enter school unless you’re vaccinated. Now, if you’re such a believer in liberty that you do not wish to be vaccinated, then there should be a consequence, and that is that you cannot infect other people.”",['anti-vaxxers']

Wendler, West Texas A&M University
Back in 2017, I started regularly leaving my office at West Texas A&M University in Canyon, Texas, to speak to high school students in the Texas Panhandle. This past fall, I did the same thing in the South Plains. These two areas are the northern most 46 counties in the state of Texas.
Driving a silver SUV owned by the university, I logged a total of 14,000 miles throughout these two regions over a total of 10 months. I visited 132 high schools with student populations of all sizes.
For instance, in the South Plains tour this past fall, I visited 66 schools that ranged in size from Lubbock High School, where I spoke to 975 juniors and seniors, to Dawson High School, where I spoke with all 12 high school students in ninth through 12th grades.
No matter where I went – and no matter if I spoke with students and families that had a concrete plan for college and others that were less certain – I heard concerns about the cost of higher education.
And my message and response was always the same: “Do not borrow money to attend West Texas A&M University (or any university) for the first two years. If you must borrow, attend community college, but don’t borrow a penny for community college either. Pay as you go.” And I should have added: Live with your parents rent-free as long as possible.
Planning for the future
You might think I was simply on a recruiting tour for the university where I serve as president. Yes, of course, I hoped that my visits helped make the university more appealing. My primary purpose, however, was not recruiting students, but helping them determine a long-range plan to enable them to become what I call “noble citizens” ready to work, engage, think and vote.
Of course, you can still be a noble citizen and have a lot of debt. It’s just a lot more difficult. If you are saddled with debt, you’re less able to contribute to the community, at least financially, or purchase a home. As I spoke with students, I shared a few statistics to help illustrate the point.
Seventy percent of college students graduated with debt in 2019 — on average, US$30,000.
Some of those graduates will still be paying off their student loans decades later, when they get Social Security checks – either voluntarily or by having those checks garnished. Of Americans over 60, 2.8 million have student loans. While 73% of those are cosigners paying for children or grandchildren, the rest are students paying off their own education loans.
Additionally, a growing number of aging Americans have college debt that they will not pay back before dying.
Default rates for borrowers over 65 are nearly 40%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Pell Grants, which are federal grants to help low-income students to pay for college, once covered 79% of tuition and fees in 1975 but only covered 29% by 2017 — a downhill slide caused by escalating costs and easy loans.
Mixed results on borrowing
Some studies suggest borrowing yields an increase in credits earned and academic performance. Despite those benefits, other research shows that student loan debt can have a negative, long-term effect on people financially and emotionally.
I told the students if they must borrow, to never borrow more than 60% of their anticipated starting salary of the first job. This is consistent with what I call the “60% Rule,” which a state higher education agency developed to make sure students don’t borrow more than their degree is worth.
For example, if someone wanted to teach in a small Texas community with a $40,000 starting salary, they should not borrow more than $24,000 to attain a bachelor’s degree. Similar – although more lenient – advice can be found in Forbes, which urged borrowers to never borrow more than their expected first year salary. (For information about the expected salary for a particular job, check the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)
In urging students not to take on too much student debt, I also highlighted other paths – aside from college – to noble citizenship: military service, certification programs or family businesses.
A duty to inform
I recognize the responsibility of university leadership to point out the challenges for students and families when borrowing for education. It is difficult for middle-income families to pay the increasing costs of a college education. Informed borrowing is the key issue for students. The need is highlighted for students who are first in their family to attend college and may accept the advice that any college degree is worth whatever it costs. It is not true. And, it is an unfair burden for university leadership to place on students.
But if students borrow for college, in my view, they should be aware that they are possibly being sucked into what I like to call a troubling triangle of treachery.
One side of the triangle is represented by elected officials who encourage everyone to go to college.
The second side is represented by lenders, who – in my view – do little to assess an individual’s ability to repay a student loan. If a student borrows to enroll in a program, limits placed on amounts borrowed are quite high when federal and private loans are combined. And they tend to treat all college degrees, and by inference, employment opportunities as equal. Yet, the employment marketplace reveals that is not the case.
The third side is represented by university leadership, which – in my view – has not done enough to let students know the pitfalls of borrowing.
A student’s indebtedness is eventually their own responsibility. Debt responsibility will not disappear for the student – or for parents who are helping them. It’s their responsibility too.
Just ask the 44 million Americans, many of whom did not graduate, who owe $1.5 trillion in student loan debt.
The tour was a learning experience. The value proposition of American higher education is changing. I saw it in the eyes of 20,000 students across 14,000 miles.

Numerous polls show that religious Americans, like most other Americans, disapprove of the president’s performance, and that could imperil his re-election chances, reported the New York Times.

Those losses could be offset by efforts from activist group’s such as Ralph Reed’s Christian Coalition, which plans to spend tens of millions of dollars to identify and register new religious conservative voters and rallying right-wing Christians.

Because Trump’s plan to gut pollution safeguards was so drastic that many states announced plans to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/blow-trump-auto-manufacturers-reach-deal-california,msnbc,environment,left,39.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"When it comes to pollution standards, this isn’t the news the Trump administration wanted to see.
Four automakers from three continents have struck a deal with California to produce more fuel-efficient cars for their U.S. fleets in coming years, undercutting one of the Trump administration’s most aggressive climate policy rollbacks. The compromise between the California Air Resources Board and Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America came after weeks of secret negotiations and could shape future U.S. vehicle production, even as White House officials aim to relax gas mileage standards for the nation’s cars, pickup trucks and SUVs.
While the original plan involved Trump administration officials negotiating with California, some of the leading auto manufacturers ended up quietly going around the White House and talking to Sacramento directly. Now, as the Washington Post’s report added, the industry is hoping the administration will join the deal it failed to negotiate.
If you’re new to this story, let’s review how we got here. To address the climate crisis, the Obama administration created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.
Manufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.
Then Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.
The president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. What the White House didn’t anticipate was the fact that auto manufacturers concluded that Trump’s anti-climate plans went too far.
In fact, in early June, most of the industry urged the administration to change course, because its plan would produce “untenable” instability.
Why? Because Trump’s plan to gut pollution safeguards was so drastic that many states announced plans to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.
That includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.
The result was a mess: car manufacturers, which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy, faced the prospect of having to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.
Not surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.
The White House briefly tried to work out a deal with California, with the intention of creating national standards that everyone could live with. Those talks failed and the administration broke off negotiations with California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and his team months ago.
And so, manufacturers decided to open a dialog of their own with the Golden State, which now appears to have produced results.
There’s clearly a lot of work left to be done, in part because of the car companies that weren’t part of the talks – today’s deal covers roughly a third of the industry – and in part because the administration may very well move forward with its plan, regardless of the new agreement.
In terms of the specifics, these are the top-line numbers to keep in mind:
* Obama plan: fleets would average ~52 miles-per-gallon by 2025
* Newly negotiated California plan: fleets would average ~51 miles-per-gallon by 2026
* Trump plan: fleets would continue to average 37 miles-per-gallon, freezing the status quo indefinitely
It’s worth emphasizing that the auto manufacturers are partly responsible for the disarray: they asked the Trump administration for a break on the Obama-era standards. But by most accounts, they expected the Republican White House to tweak the policy, not kill it. Now the companies are scrambling to put things right.

And according to a study by Nature Medicine released on Monday, increased heat will have deadly results.
Yessenia Funes, discussing the study in Gizmodo, notes that the effects of more hot days will go “beyond heat stroke and dehydration, which are commonly thought of as the drivers of heat-related death and illness.” Funes explains, “People tend to drink more when it’s warmer — a.k.a., summertime — and that may contribute to the higher rates of deadly car accidents during this time of year. Higher temperatures have also been linked with higher mortality from assault and suicide, though researchers don’t quite understand why that might be yet.”
Funes points out that according to Robbie Parks (a research associate at Imperial College London’s Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics), “There is a dearth of evidence about how warm temperatures impact injuries. Such injury deaths include suicide, assault, transport accidents, drownings and falls.”
The Nature Medicine study, Funes observes, finds that most deaths from rising temperatures would be from “transport injuries, which include accidents from any roadway vehicle, as well as flights, boats and trains. Suicide, unfortunately, comes in a close second for the highest number of deaths.”
Funes points out that as temperatures rise, even “leisure activities to beat the heat could end up killing people.” According to Funes, “The study reveals a whole host of new problems that come with a warming world that policymakers will need to consider.” And those “policymakers,” Funes notes, must “decide how they want to prevent more unnecessary deaths from happening. They can build out protections to keep Americans safer when things get real.”","['extreme', 'more', 'severe', 'accelerates']"

Conway recycled a right-wing talking point that falsely claims a bill designed to loosen certain restrictions on late-term abortions in Virginia is “infanticide” during her Monday appearance on “Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner.”,https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/595743792/0/alternet_all~Watch-Kellyanne-Conway-threatens-to-%e2%80%98perform%e2%80%99-abortions-%e2%80%98with-a-gun%e2%80%99-on-feminists-in-newly-resurfaced-video/,alternet,abortion,left,40.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"After Kellyanne Conway recently questioned why abortion rights are labeled “women’s issues” on Fox News, an old video of the counselor to President Donald Trump threatening to “perform” abortions on feminists using guns was resurfaced by a well-known media news outlet.
Conway recycled a right-wing talking point that falsely claims a bill designed to loosen certain restrictions on late-term abortions in Virginia is “infanticide” during her Monday appearance on “Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner.”
“You say most of the mainstream media being pro-abortion,” Faulkner began. “I’m sure some of them would definitely take exception to that, as they do their jobs objectively.”
“They’re going to say they’re pro-choice, but are they for this war against this?” Conway asked in response. “You can’t be pro-choice and no longer – and no longer own and claim these late-term abortions that are now being proposed as law in New York, in Virginia and in four other states. You can’t pick and choose.”
Faulkner was quick to point out to Conway that abortion was, in fact, a political issue – not a media issue. As she sought to shield her colleagues in the so-called “mainstream media” from the “shot” that was taken at them by Conway, the counselor to the president spoke over the Fox News host before eventually grinding the interview to a halt.
“I’m sorry. I have to say this: Why do they call it ‘women’s issues’ then?” Conway questioned Faulkner. “Why do we always have to hear that such-and-such politician is bad or good on ‘women’s issues?’ Don’t they really mean abortion? Because I’ve been in politics for 30 years, and I’ve never – not a single time – heard the phrase ‘men’s issues,’ because people believe men – male voters can handle all the issues.”
In the wake of Conway’s appearance, Mediaite on Monday resurfaced a 2007 speech Conway made before the College Republican National Committee. The July 13 appearance was captured by C-Span, whose website says the video “is not available at this time.”
“I always love to say to those gender studies people: If you say ‘abortion,’ or ‘stem cells’ or ‘guns’ one more time, I’m going to perform one of those on you,” Conway can be heard saying in the video. “Because, you know with a gun, because you, by implication, are suggesting that women can’t do the math.”
Here’s Kellyanne Conway threatening to “perform” an abortion on feminists “with a gun.” #adultsInTheRoom pic.twitter.com/zchqQbqeu5 — Tommy MMXIXtopher (@tommyxtopher) December 27, 2018
Conway argued during her Monday appearance on Fox that the news media had given “very little coverage” to the divisive Virginia bill known as the Repeal Act, which was put under a microscope after the bill’s sponsor incorrectly said it would allow the procedure to occur even after a woman went into labor. A state House subcommittee voted 5-3 to kill the bill, with all Republicans voting against it and all Democrats supporting it. The issue was ultimately overshadowed by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who came under widespread condemnation after his racist entry in his medical school yearbook from the 1980’s was released.
The legislation, which was sponsored by Democratic Del. Kathy Tran, immediately came under fierce backlash after the lawmaker incorrectly told a Republican colleague that her proposal would allow for an abortion to occur when a woman is in labor and about to give birth. Tran’s comments, made during a legislative hearing about the bill, were quickly clipped and circulated by Republican groups and went viral on social media, where Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL, also claimed the bill supports “legal infanticide.”
I never thought I would see the day America had government officials who openly support legal infanticide. https://t.co/VzM4FPO7QT — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 30, 2019
Tran issued a video statement last Thursday in an effort to explain the intent of the bill she introduced. “I introduced a bill to repeal the medically unnecessary and unduly burdensome barriers Virginia women face when they are accessing this healthcare service in consultation with their doctor,” she explained, referring to the Virginia law that mandates three doctors certify a third-trimester abortion.
“I presented my bill this week and I was really surprised at the line of questioning that I got,” she continued. “I want to be very clear by what’s currently allowed in Virginia law. Right now, women are able to access an abortion in the later stages of pregnancy under certain conditions with the approval of medical doctors. I’ve done nothing to change that. What I have done is try to make sure that women are able to make these decisions and access these services in a timely manner.”","['recycled', 'infanticide']"
Anti-vaccine groups take dangerous online harassment into the real world,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/anti-vaccine-groups-take-dangerous-harassment-offline-real-world-n1096461,msnbc,vaccines,left,40.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
In October, Dr. Eve Krief watched from the window of her Long Island, New York, pediatrics practice, as around 20 women gathered on the lawn.
Armed with signs and banners with messages like, “We spread truth not disease,” the women — a group of anti-vaccine activists from New York and California — had come to protest Krief over her recent support for the 2019 state law that removed religious exemptions for vaccines.
Some of the protesters sat with signs, while others stuck anti-vaccine propaganda under car windshield wipers in the parking lot. Several approached parents entering the building with their infants, asking, ""Are you vaccinating your baby?""
Krief had experience with these particular women. She recognized the group's leader, a local mother who had followed her to her car after a community meeting about proposed vaccine legislation a few weeks earlier. Krief said the bill's passage led to more intense protest from people who had been using the religious exemption to mask their personal preference not to vaccinate. They had also infiltrated her Yelp and Health Grades accounts, posting negative reviews, although they weren't patients at her practice.
But the in-person protests and the interaction with patients was another level.
""It's unsettling,"" Krief said, adding that her office is beefing up security measures in response.
For the anti-vaccination organizers, Krief’s unease was an indicator of their success.
“Needless to say,” one wrote on her Facebook page, “we rattled her cage just a bit yesterday with our presence.”
New outbreaks and new laws
Opposition to immunizations was once largely limited to online bullying, but now opponents are increasingly taking their harassment tactics into the real world: aggressively following legislators and doctors and, in some cases, using physical violence.
The degree to which the anti-vaccine extremists takes this is in excess of any other group.
But as opposition to vaccination has risen in recent years, so have cases of measles. Major outbreaks occurred in California and New York have spurred lawmakers in those states to strengthen vaccine mandates for school children. Reaction from anti-vaccine groups was swift and violent.
Online conspiracy theorist Austin Bennett livestreamed himself physically shoving the author of California's law, state Sen. Dr. Richard Pan. Bennett was later charged with a misdemeanor. The next month, Rebecca Dalelio, a participant at a protest at the California state Capitol, was charged with assault and vandalism when police say she threw a menstrual cup full of blood on lawmakers in the gallery.
Pan, who is also a pediatrician, suspects he was Dalelio's target.
""Everyone around me was hit"" when the blood splattered on the legislative floor, he said.
Pan said anti-vaccine groups have stalked him at conferences, speaking engagements, even the March for Science in Washington.
As legislators, ""we deal with all sorts of contentious issues — guns, abortions, lots of issues people are very passionate about,"" Pan said. ""But the degree to which the anti-vaccine extremists takes this is in excess of any other group.""
'An awful new normal'
The main target of the anti-vaccine community is the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. False links between the vaccine and a variety of conditions, including autism and sudden infant death syndrome, have been widely circulated on social media. These alleged links have been fully debunked.
On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that overall, there's been a 66 percent drop in measles cases worldwide since 2000, largely thanks to vaccination. The report estimates 23.2 million lives have been saved around the world because of the MMR vaccine.

But the downward trend of measles cases is showing worrisome signs of reversal. In the United States this year, 1,261 measles cases have been reported in 31 states — the largest number in almost three decades, according to the CDC.
During an infectious diseases conference in New York in November, Dr. Peter Hotez was followed throughout a hotel by several aggressive anti-vaccination protesters who filmed while pelting him with questions predicated on vaccine hoaxes. Hotez is a vaccine scientist, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, and author of the recent book, ""Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism.""
Hotez tweeted from the event, thanking hotel security for “getting me out safe.”
“I've been targeted by them for 20 years,” Hotez said. But the real-life harassment is part of “an awful new normal.”
For years, people opposed to vaccines have flooded Hotez’s social media accounts, calling him a shill for the pharmaceutical industry, though he’s never been paid by a drugmaker. That harassment has increased as the anti-vaccination movement has grown, first on social media, and then assisted by the sale of books and videos through Amazon, Hotez said.
The handful of doctors and scientists targeted by the movement have been largely left to combat misinformation and weather the subsequent harassment on their own, he added.
The CDC, the surgeon general and, until recently, even major medical societies and doctors, have been slow to counteract misinformation spread by vaccine protesters, Hotez said. That unwillingness to engage the anti-vaccination crowd could have disastrous consequences, he said.
“Future measles outbreaks, deaths from the flu,” Hotez said. “We’re condemning a generation of women to cancer,"" he said, referring to the HPV vaccine, which protects against cervical cancer, as well as cancers of the anus, penis and throat.
At the center of these aggressive protests and actions is Joshua Coleman, who claims a vaccine injury confined his son to a wheelchair. Coleman — who was charged with willful cruelty to a child in 2015 related to a fight over a parking spot at a local elementary school — organizes events like the one that targeted Hotez, and provides templates for the black and red signs emblazoned with vaccine misinformation that have been a staple of recent protests.
Vaccine advocates have likened the newer protests to publicity stunts from the Westboro Baptist church — offensive signs and sometimes costumes, paired with harassment of passers-by at events the media is already covering. Events in Times Square, at Disneyland, and at the premiere of the movie Frozen II, which stars the actress Kristin Bell, an outspoken supporter of vaccinations, have been counted as successes and shared widely by the anti-vaccine community on their Facebook and Instagram pages. Bell is a favorite target; activists recently crashed the unveiling of her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and interrupted her appearance on The Jimmy Kimmel show.
Going offline
The real-world attacks on doctors, scientists and vaccine supporters seem to be a direct response to this year’s actions by Facebook and YouTube to rein in vaccine misinformation on their platforms. Videos and posts with content the platforms label as vaccine misinformation aren’t being seen and shared like they were in 2016.
“'I’m not able to communicate online through videos anymore and actually have people see it,” Coleman said. “That's kind of what started the whole concept of taking it to the streets and being out there with signs and with flyers.”
The threat of in-person violence has always been there.
Coleman travels extensively; in November, he was in New York, California and Hawaii. That travel is supported by people who donate their airline miles, take up collections, or provide free lodging, in exchange for his help planning and documenting their protests, Coleman said.
He dismisses claims of harassment.
“These guys are making a big deal out of nothing,” Coleman said.
When presented with examples, such as the woman who threw blood at Sen. Pan, Coleman distanced both himself and the greater movement. “I’m just as horrified as anybody else,” he said. “It really isn't indicative of the behavior of most of our people.”
Indeed, Coleman and other prominent anti-vaccine groups says the perpetrators were not associated with the larger movement.
But Coleman’s signs were on display outside a Thanksgiving turkey drive at a school in Sen. Pan’s district where flu shots were being administered to low-income residents. One activist livestreamed on Facebook from inside the school gymnasium. In the video, she mocks Pan and his aide, while telling parents attending the drive that vaccines cause harm.
A chilling effect
The continued harassment could have a chilling effect among public health advocates and parents, said Leah Russin, executive director of the parent advocacy group, Vaccinate California.
“The threat of in-person violence has always been there,” Russin said. “But I think the reality of it has escalated. My fear is that it’s going to drown out and shut down public health advocates.""
The anti-vaccine vitriol has proven effective in Florida.
State Sen. Lauren Book filed a bill that would have removed the religious exemption for vaccinating school children in the state. Anti-vaccination parents and groups soon filled public hearings, insisting that legislators reject the measure.
Book was also the target of a social media smear campaign filled with profanity from anti-vaccine groups, as well as images of Book mocked up to look like Adolf Hitler. Book is Jewish.
The legislature declined to hear debate on the bill, rendering it dead on arrival.
""I knew this was a very serious group of folks, but I don't know that I knew the voracity with which they advocate,"" Book said. ""There is no conversation. There is no common ground.""
""It's been a very, very difficult road,"" she added.
Both Pan and Book say they want to have a dialogue with people who have earnest questions or concerns about bills, but draw the line at violence.
""If we make policy based on conspiracy theories, that's not good for our country. That's not good for society. Policy needs to be grounded in truth,"" Pan said. ""We need to be clear: bullying and intimidation of this kind is unacceptable.""
Krief, the Long Island pediatrician, said that getting patients to vaccinate and discussing parents’ questions is her ""biggest responsibility.""
""We’ve saved millions of children’s lives because of vaccination. But we live in an age where people haven’t seen the harm and death that these diseases caused in the past,"" she said.
""Because they haven’t lived it, they don’t understand.""

"In Washington, three key issues seemed to galvanize most of the protesters: climate change, immigration and reproductive rights.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/women-s-march-draws-thousands-rallies-across-county-n1118416?cid=public-rss_20200119,msnbc,environment,left,40.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

WASHINGTON — Thousands gathered in cities across the country Saturday as part of the nationwide Women's March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration.
Hundreds showed up in New York City and thousands in Washington, D.C. for the rallies, which aim to harness the political power of women, although crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. Marches were scheduled Saturday in more than 180 cities.
The first marches in 2017 drew hundreds of thousands of people to rallies in cities across the country on the day after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. That year's D.C. march drew close to 1 million people.
In Manhattan on Saturday, hundreds of people who gathered at separate events in Foley Square and Columbus Circle planned to converge at Times Square as part of a “Rise and Roar"" rally.
“Today, we will be the change that is needed in this world! Today, we rise into our power!” activist Donna Hill told a cheering crowd in Foley Square.
In downtown Los Angeles, thousands of men, women and children filled several blocks as they made their way from a plaza to a park adjacent to City Hall, where a rally featured speeches by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Mayor Eric Garcetti, Rep. Maxine Waters and others.
Jennifer Siebel Newsom reflected on the progress women have made “in the four years since a predator-in-chief took office.” She credited women for mobilizing against gun violence, creating the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and discrimination, and taking back the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.
“In 2020, I have no doubt that it will be women who will lead again, rise up and move this country forward on a path toward justice,” she said.
L.A.'s event was also expected to feature women's rights attorney Gloria Allred, actor Rosanna Arquette and reality television personality Caitlyn Jenner.
Missing from the stage was the founding chapter of Black Lives Matter, the national organization that has brought renewed attention to police shootings of African Americans. The group, which has bitterly opposed the leadership of Mayor Eric Garcetti, a scheduled speaker, said it wasn't invited.

""Maybe they should rebrand themselves the #WhiteWomensMarch,"" it said on Twitter.
The ACLU of Southern California and scheduled speaker June Diane Raphael, an actor and writer, said they were pulling out of the Los Angeles event in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.
BLM co-founder Melina Abdullah said rifts with the Womens March have also appeared in Chicago, Houston and Washington.
""The exclusion of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles is shameful,"" she said. ""It seems that the Womens March really wants to practice what we call celebrity style leadership.""
The Womens March Foundation said in a statement that it hoped BLM would march at the event.
""While we support Black Lives Matter and its work, since this is an important election year, our speaking program for Women's March LA 2020 is focused on highlighting organizations and individuals who have a mission to register and encourage people to vote,"" the foundation said.
Organizers of the Washington march faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize.
“Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter this week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”
In Denver, organizers opted to skip the rally after the march and instead invited participants to meet with local organizations to learn more about issues such as reproductive rights, climate change, gun safety and voting.
Several thousand came out for the protest in Washington, far fewer than last year when about 100,000 people held a rally east of the White House. But as in previous years, many of the protesters made the trip to the nation’s capital from cities across the country to express their opposition to Trump and his policies. From their gathering spot on Freedom Plaza, they had a clear view down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol, where the impeachment trial gets underway in the Senate next week.
In Washington, three key issues seemed to galvanize most of the protesters: climate change, immigration and reproductive rights.
“I teach a lot of immigrant students, and in political times like this I want to make sure I'm using my voice to speak up for them,” said Rochelle McGurn, 30, an elementary school teacher from Burlington, Vermont who was in D.C. to march. “They need to feel like they belong, because they do.”
Peta Madry of New London, Connecticut, was celebrating her 70th birthday in D.C. by attending her fourth Women’s March with her sister, Cynthia Barnard, of San Rafael, California. Both women were wearing handknitted pink hats that date from the first march. With pained expressions, they spoke about Trump’s determination to reverse the policies of his predecessor Barack Obama and his treatment of women.
“Look what he’s doing to Greta Thunberg,” Madry said, referring to the teenage climate activist. “He’s the biggest bully in the world.”
Melissa McCullough of Georgetown, Indiana, said when she recently turned 50 she promised herself that she would get more involved politically. “I’m here to protest Trump, as a woman,” she said.
Her daughter, 19-year-old University of Cincinnati student Elizabeth McCullough, chimed in to say that most women’s issues are human issues, and they talked about the need to protect immigrants.
“You have to push to protect everyone or no one’s safe,” Melissa McCullough said.
The protesters planned to march around the White House, but Trump wasn’t there. He is spending the holiday weekend at his resort in Florida.",['galvanize']
"In practice, that means it's hard to trust Bezos' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal. ",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-climate-change-philanthropy-has-quite-few-hidden-strings-ncna1143791?cid=public-rss_20200228,msnbc,environment,left,40.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"On Feb. 17, Amazon CEO and occasional richest-man-in-the-world Jeff Bezos announced he was committing $10 billion — 7 to 8 percent of his massive fortune — to an initiative to combat climate change, dubbed the Bezos Earth Fund. Exactly how the funds will be distributed remains to be seen, but Bezos claims money will start flowing this summer in the form of grants to scientists, activists and nonprofit groups for ""any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world."" It's quite a reversal for the billionaire, who once declared, ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.""
Bezos' change of heart aligns him with other powerful people. Last year, former Republican New York mayor and current candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Mike Bloomberg pledged $500 million to shut down coal plants across the United States. Goldman Sachs, the reviled investment bank, said it will invest $750 billion in ""sustainable finance projects"" over 10 years. And earlier this month, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has around $47 billion in its ever-growing endowment, added climate change to its philanthropic priorities.
It might seem that having wealthy individuals and multinational corporations promising so much money for climate initiatives would be a good thing. But it's much more complicated than just rich people trying to make the planet a better place. Anand Giridharadas, author of ""Winner Takes All,"" has emerged as one of the chief critics of this recent spate of billionaire philanthropy. Giridharadas writes that for all their talk of changing the world through charitable giving, what elites offer is a ""fake change"" that seeks ""to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix — and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.""

In practice, that means it's hard to trust Bezos' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal. Its push for ever-faster delivery times, as little as one to two days in parts of the country, also comes with an environmental cost.
Then there's the bigger question of why philanthropists are suddenly focusing on the environment. Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action. In the United States, President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, rolled back plenty of environmental regulations and opened Alaska's wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, among other backward measures, but even officials at the lower levels of government aren't doing enough.
Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors is that government has failed to take bold action.
But U.S. officials are far from the only offenders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got some good press for implementing a carbon tax, but his government isn't on track to meet its Paris targets, either. Canada also nationalized a pipeline that would increase emissions and facilitate an expansion of Alberta's oil sands, and it is still dealing with crippling rail blockades after federal police forced indigenous land defenders out of the way of yet another pipeline. Meanwhile, politicians in Australia's right-wing government continue to oppose climate action, even in the face of record fires, and the European Union is funding new gas projects despite declaring a climate emergency.
But this lack of vision is not inherent to the public sphere. Rather, Giridharadas argues, it's the product of a broken system captured by notions of ""business fundamentalism"" and ""market worship,"" in which even those in the public sector believe that the capitalist class must chart the path forward. This is largely the product of a mindset promoted by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and brought into the Democratic Party by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which devalues the role of government in favor of the private sector.
In 2019, the 500 richest people in the world increased their wealth by $1.2 trillion, an increase of 25 percent in a single year. Also relevant: The richest 10 percent of people worldwide are responsible for nearly half of global emissions. Yet the tax rate paid by American billionaires fell below that of the working class in 2018 — and all their philanthropy actually reduces the tax they pay. Amazon, one of the most valuable companies in the world, paid no federal tax in 2018, instead receiving a $129 million tax refund.
That transfer of wealth has limited the ability of government to respond to social problems while increasing the economic power of billionaires. To some, that may seem like a good thing — we've been told for decades that the private sector is more efficient. But as Giridharadas says: ""There is enormous moral difference between five guys deciding to do something and a city deciding to do something. This is something I think you wouldn't have had to explain to people 100 years or 200 years ago when we actually had more faith in the idea of democratic action."" By leaving so much to billionaires, democracy is eroded.
The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations. In the past, large-scale social and economic transformations have always required government action, whether it was $500 billion to build the Interstate highway system, the creation of the Federal Housing Authority to subsidize homeownership and the suburbanization of the country or, as Sen. Bernie Sanders talked about recently at CNN's Nevada town hall, the restructuring of the U.S. economy to defeat fascism in World War II. These kinds of massive structural changes could not be accomplished by the private sector alone; Bezos' $10 billion wouldn't even cover the cost of New York City's Second Avenue Subway line, let alone a large-scale transformation of the entire country.
This is because, as Giridharadas writes, ""changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up."" That something is the power and wealth billionaires have derived from an economy that privileges growth at all costs and has caused inequality to soar and accelerated the climate crisis. But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society. They profit from the world as it is, not as it could be.
That's why billionaires' donations will never be enough. The highways, the suburbs and the victory against the Nazis — just to provide a few examples — are products not of the private sector but of government action. Through state spending, regulatory powers and the tax code, the government set the framework and priorities that businesses then responded to — and if we have any hope of cutting emissions in half by 2030, as the scientists tell us we need to do, we'll need the government to use its power to reset the rules once again.
The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place. For that, we need the government to redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, change the tax code to penalize unsustainable industries, alter regulations to encourage denser development and ultimately set a framework that's more favorable to workers and communities that have been left behind these past few decades. That's why, regardless of what billionaires do, we need a Green New Deal to chart the path forward.","['aggressively', 'courting', 'hard', 'to', 'trust', 'threatened']"
"Smith’s announcement Sunday at the all-male, historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia provoked impassioned calls for both making higher education free across the country and canceling student debt.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/05/commencement-speaker-pays-off-40-million-in-student-debt-a-burning-indictment-of-our-higher-ed-system/,alternet,student-debt,left,41.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Commencement speaker Robert F. Smith garnered widespread praise Sunday when the billionaire investor announced he will wipe out an estimated $40 million in student debt for Morehouse College’s nearly 400 graduating seniors—but the move also sparked intense criticism of the cost of higher education in the United States.
“Two things are simultaneously true about this story: 1. This is a very cool thing to do,” tweetedCurrent Affairs editor Sparky Abraham. “2. That this is so cool and necessary and has such a huge impact on the students’ lives is a burning indictment of our higher ed system.”
“The Morehouse graduating class has $40 million in student debt,” he continued. “That is an enormous tragedy.”
Smith’s announcement Sunday at the all-male, historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia provoked impassioned calls for both making higher education free across the country and canceling student debt.
Abraham, in a piece for Current Affairs last month, argued: “Free college is the efficient, non-stigmatizing way to open up college access for everyone without the burdens of means-testing. It doesn’t have to be regressive and, with any luck, it will follow the path of free high school: In short order it will be nearly universally accepted as a public good and a huge boon to everyone, especially those from poorer and working class backgrounds.”
Responding to Smith’s donation on Sunday, Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats tweeted, “Taxing billionaires and Wall Street would allow every American to go to college for free while also canceling almost all student debt.”
﻿
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) suggested in a series of tweets that this could serve as a “natural experiment” to demonstrate how lack of student debt impacts graduates’ lives.
“It’s important to note that people shouldn’t be in a situation where they depend on a stranger’s enormous act of charity for this kind of liberation to begin with (aka college should be affordable),” the congresswoman added.
It’s important to note that people shouldn’t be in a situation where they depend on a stranger’s enormous act of charity for this kind of liberation to begin with (aka college should be affordable), but it is an incredible act of community investment in this system as it is. ? — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 19, 2019
“I’ve been teaching [at] Morehouse for 3 years now and I see firsthand the burden of costs for an education has on black folks,” David Dennis Jr., a writer and adjunct professor of journalism at the college, said in a series of tweets. “Getting rid of their student loan debt is going to literally change the lives of every single graduate. Incredible.”
Dennis also called attention to the banks and predatory lenders that will receive the estimated $40 million:
He saved at least 3 generations (parents, students and the students future kids) from an unending pile of crippling debt. At the same time I can’t ever get over that 400 black men graduating from an HBCU on one Sunday represented so much money for so many predators — David Dennis Jr. (@DavidDTSS) May 19, 2019
One graduating Morehouse student interviewed by The Associated Press, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom, racked up $200,000 in loans, which eight of his family members co-signed so he could make it through four years of schooling.
Mitchom said that prior to Smith’s announcement, he used a spreadsheet to figure how long it would take to pay off his debt—per his calculations, it worked out to 25 years at half his monthly salary.
Describing his reaction at the ceremony on Sunday, Mitchom told the AP: “I don’t have to live off of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I was shocked. My heart dropped. We all cried. In the moment it was like a burden had been taken off.”
Linking to the AP report that features Mitchom, New York Times writer Astead Herndon tweeted, “Yes, the Morehouse story is a beautiful moment provided by an unequal system.”",['impassioned']
Though  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was by no means the first to describe migrant detention centres as concentration camps — disgraced Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio boasted his “tent city” in the Sonora Desert was just that — her comments ignited a firestorm of controversy.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/concentration-camps-have-deep-roots-in-liberal-democracies/,alternet,immigration,left,41.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Aidan Forth, MacEwan University
The New York Times recently reported that U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to authorize shooting Central American migrants in the legs and building snake- and alligator-infested moats to stop them from entering the United States.
Instead, his administration continues to house them in overcrowded detention camps on the southern border.
United States congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the Trump administration for running “concentration camps” earlier this year.
Though she was by no means the first to describe migrant detention centres as concentration camps — disgraced Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio boasted his “tent city” in the Sonora Desert was just that — her comments ignited a firestorm of controversy.
Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney complained concentration camp comparisons “demeaned the memory” of six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust and she urged AOC to learn some “actual history.”
The U.S. Holocaust Museum also issued a statement rejecting analogies between the Holocaust and other events, prompting more than 500 historians to petition the museum to reverse its “radical” and “ahistorical” position: “Similarities across time and space” were essential to learning lessons from the past, they argued.
An American Holocaust survivor even recently compared her childhood in a concentration camp in German-occupied Poland to the separation of migrant families in the southern United States.
And so looking back on a summer of heated and often misleading debate, two important points bear repeating.
British work camps
First: Concentration camps are by no means only synonymous with Nazi terror or totalitarianism. In fact, concentration camps have deep roots within the culture and politics of Anglo-Saxon liberal democracies.
In Victorian India, for example, Britain concentrated millions of “migratory people” fleeing drought and famine in a system of work camps designed to prevent unwanted populations from entering colonial towns.
And the term “concentration camp” itself dates back to the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), when Britain detained a quarter million civilians, mostly women and children, displaced by scorched-earth warfare.
Heeding advice from a young Winston Churchill, the United States soon established its own camps during the Philippine War (1899-1902), contributing to an American tradition — already prevailing in the form of guarded Indigenous encampments — of concentrating unwanted groups behind barbed wire.
Some decades later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt revived this well-established practice when he ordered Japanese immigrants and their descendants into what he called “concentration camps” (like the one at Fort Sill, recently proposed as a migrant detention facility).
The Anglo-Saxon world therefore has a long history of concentrating “undesirables” in facilities historically known as “concentration camps.”
Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric denigrating asylum seekers as “criminals,” “rapists” and “disease carriers” may well resemble Nazi statements directed at Jews, but it also revives a longer discourse of colonial racism in Britain and the United States.
South African refugees, British officers maintained, were a “dirty, careless, lazy lot” who spread disease, crime and poverty.
As America carried the “white man’s burden” across Latin America and the Pacific, it articulated a familiar language when detaining “semi-civilized” “half-breeds” in Philippine camps.
Stemming from racist tropes rooted in Euro-American settler expansion, meanwhile, concentration camps during the Second World War were aimed at preventing Japanese newcomers from “taking over” American jobs.
The crisis mentality in the U.S. following Pearl Harbor facilitated longstanding ideas about racial cleansing. In this context, it’s hardly surprising that Trump’s White House has used militarized language to present migrant flows as an “invasion” and “national crisis.” It revives an Anglo-American practice of suspending civil rights and constitutional protections under the guise of a declared emergency.
Trump routinely violates democratic norms, but his statements and policies sit within an established continuum —an “American way” — of establishing concentration camps.
Parallels and lessons
History provides both parallels and lessons.
Like today’s migrant shelters, British concentration camps in South Africa were hastily improvised, often with impermanent canvas tents, and administrators struggled to cope with a mass influx of inmates amid limited resources.
Statements from leaders like Lord Kitchener lambasting refugees as “savages with only a thin white veneer” framed official attitudes. Private letters deprecating the homes inmates left behind as “fit only for pigs” further served to justify appalling conditions.
South Africa, according to the British at the time, was a “shithole country” (to use Trump’s modern-day lexicon) and its residents deserved only the most basic facilities.
As with U.S. migrant camps, British concentration camps did not provide soap or sanitary facilities, and they were hopelessly overcrowded.
Worse still, inhuman conditions resulted in the outbreak of epidemic diseases — measles and typhoid in particular — that killed thousands of inmates. With modern vaccinations, America is unlikely to see similar death rates, yet Britain’s crowded camps are ominous portents as mortality rates rise at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency’s standing-room-only cells.
What not to do
Britain’s concentration camps demonstrate what not to do. But they also offer lessons in the virtues of engaged journalism and open democracy.
As images of detained and suffering children infiltrated London newspapers, humanitarian activists like Emily Hobhouse, who travelled to South Africa to personally visit the camps, and opposition politicians like Liberal Party leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who condemned the camps as “methods of barbarism,” mobilized civil society.
After months of complaints about “hysterical women” meddling in politics — Hobhouse was no more popular than Ocasio-Cortez — daily revelations about “prison camps” surrounded by “barbed-wire fences” eventually forced action.
War Secretary St. John Brodrick appointed an independent commission to report on camp conditions, and he rapidly accepted its recommendations.
In doing so, the government drastically reduced camp mortality and silenced its critics. More importantly, High Commissioner Alfred Milner conceded the camps had been a tragic mistake —the “one black spot of the war” —and rapidly disbanded them as soon as inmates could viably return home.
Britain went on to develop future camps —most controversially in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion. But in the immediate future, lessons from South Africa helped prevent Britain from interning German women and children during the First World War, a policy lauded as a moral and political success
If Trump wishes to mitigate further fallout from migrant detention, he might forsake his fantasies of terrorizing migrants as they attempt to enter the U.S. and listen instead to activists, journalists and lawyers.
Far from peddling “fake news,” their oversight, historically, has offered an important check on detention camps.

"Unbelievably, with all they had seen their child suffer, his parents not only refused the doctor’s suggestion that he receive another DTaP vaccination they also declined all the other scheduled vaccinations the boy had missed.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/parents-see-their-unvaccinated-child-suffer-the-agonies-of-tetanus-yet-theyre-still-anti-vaxxers/,alternet,vaccines,left,41.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While playing, a six-year-old boy in Oregon cut his head on some farm machinery. His parents cleaned and stitched the wound. Six days later his back and neck arched and he jaw began clenching. He had to be medevaced to a pediatric hospital where he was diagnosed with a severe case of tetanus.
He rapidly declined. At first he was alert. Then he had to be sedated and intubated as spasms interfered with his breathing. He was given an anti-tetanus immunoglobulin for his wound, as well as the DTaP vaccine, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. He was kept in a dark room with earplugs to reduce the intensity of his spasms. His scalp wound was cleaned by people who were trained to clean wounds.
The arching of the boy’s neck and back worsened. His blood pressure shot up. He became feverish. Doctors inserted a tube in his windpipe so a ventilator could help with his breathing, and treated him with neuromuscular-blocking drugs to reduce his muscle spasms. He would remain in the ICU for 47 days.
He then spent 2½ weeks in rehab. And it took another month before he returned to normal activities.
The cost for his treatment — excluding the medevac and rehab — amounted to $811,929. It is not clear who footed the bill. If the parents had instead given their child the recommended five doses of the DTaP vaccination the cost would have been $125-150. And their child wouldn’t have had to go through the agony of the disease.
Unbelievably, with all they had seen their child suffer, his parents not only refused the doctor’s suggestion that he receive another DTaP vaccination they also declined all the other scheduled vaccinations the boy had missed.
It is hard to see how this isn’t child endangerment.
Fortunately for the rest of the community, tetanus is not a contagious disease. So, in this case, the stupidity of the parents only put their own child at risk. But so many anti-vaxxers add selfishness to their faults and put innocent children, who because of age or immune system deficiencies cannot be vaccinated, in danger.
There may be some readers of this diary who maintain that vaccinations are risky and they are justified in ‘not injecting poison into my kid’. Sorry, there is no science which supports that position. There is, however, overwhelming evidence of the benefits of vaccinations — just ask all the kids who don’t have polio, smallpox, diphtheria, meningitis, rubella, hepatitis A & B, et al.
People who live in a society have an obligation to that society. I am forbidden from driving drunk. If I were to argue that I have ‘science’ to show that drinking doesn’t impair my ability to drive; or that I needed to drink to survive; or my religion mandates that I drink and drive, people would think I was nuts. And at the very least would demand I stay off public roads.
So if you chose not to vaccinate your child, please have the decency to keep your children away from other parents’ kids.",['Unbelievably']
"Donald Trump announced at the time that the Environmental Protection Agency would be led, at least temporarily, by Andrew Wheeler – a former lobbyist for, among others, Murray Energy, one of the nation’s largest coal companies and former chief counsel for Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the nation’s preeminent climate deniers.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/senate-republicans-rally-behind-coal-lobbyist-lead-the-epa,msnbc,environment,left,42.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"When a series of head-shaking scandals and investigations forced Scott Pruitt to resign as the EPA administrator last summer, those concerned with the environment breathed a sigh of relief. As regular readers may recall, that exhale ended the moment they saw who’d take Pruitt’s place.
Donald Trump announced at the time that the Environmental Protection Agency would be led, at least temporarily, by Andrew Wheeler – a former lobbyist for, among others, Murray Energy, one of the nation’s largest coal companies. Wheeler also served as chief counsel for Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the nation’s preeminent climate deniers.
The New Republic’s Emily Atkin explained a while back, “Wheeler is not just the figurative embodiment of the swamp, but the literal embodiment of it. The coal industry is responsible for 72 percent of toxic water contamination in the United States, making it the nation’s largest water polluter. That’s according to the agency where Wheeler is about to be second in command – the agency that is charged with protecting clean water.”
As of this afternoon, he’ll now lead the entire agency.
The Senate confirmed Andrew Wheeler as EPA’s fifteenth administrator Thursday, cementing the authority of one of President Donald Trump’s most effective and prolific de-regulators. He was confirmed by a vote of 52-47. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.) was the only Republican to vote against him; no Democrats voted for him. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) did not vote.
The only Republican who balked at Wheeler’s nomination was Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).
Some may be tempted to assume that Wheeler’s leadership of the EPA won’t be much worse than Pruitt’s. I continue to think that assumption is misplaced.
Pruitt wasn’t just accused of widespread corruption; he was also hopelessly incompetent. In many respects, environmentalists got lucky in this regard. I’m reminded of this New York Times report from April:
[L]egal experts and White House officials say that in Mr. Pruitt’s haste to undo government rules and in his eagerness to hold high-profile political events promoting his agenda, he has often been less than rigorous in following important procedures, leading to poorly crafted legal efforts that risk being struck down in court. The result, they say, is that the rollbacks, intended to fulfill one of the president’s central campaign pledges, may ultimately be undercut or reversed…. Six of Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to delay or roll back Obama-era regulations – on issues including pesticides, lead paint and renewable-fuel requirements – have been struck down by the courts. Mr. Pruitt also backed down on a proposal to delay implementing smog regulations and another to withdraw a regulation on mercury pollution. Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard, told the Times, “In their rush to get things done, [Pruitt and his team are] failing to dot their i’s and cross their t’s. And they’re starting to stumble over a lot of trip wires, They’re producing a lot of short, poorly crafted rulemakings that are not likely to hold up in court.”
Wheeler, in contrast, knows what he’s doing.
Under Mr. Pruitt, who resigned July 5 under a cloud of ethics investigations, the agency pushed for ambitious but fast-paced rollbacks of environmental rules. At least a half-dozen of those have been struck down by federal courts. Mr. Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who served as Mr. Pruitt’s deputy, has brought a more disciplined approach to dismantling environmental rules. It is an approach that may take longer, but it may be more effective in standing up to the inevitable legal challenges. Prof. Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University, said Mr. Wheeler was “trying to be more careful and less sloppy” than his former boss. “By taking time to improve the quality of the legal justifications, Wheeler may ensure that E.P.A. won’t be subject to losing on certain types of policies,” Professor Revesz said.
Given Wheeler’s vision and agenda, his competence at using the levers of power is not good news for those concerned about the environment.","['preeminent', 'climate', 'deniers']"
It is a monumental ode to human stupidity that the wealthiest nation in the world teeters on the edge of a dangerous measles epidemic at the same time that poor nations are struggling to vaccinate their residents. ,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/anti-vaxxers-are-just-as-bad-as-climate-deniers/,alternet,vaccines,left,42.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"There have been at least 555 confirmed cases of the highly contagious measles virus since January alone, prompting officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to call this sudden eruption the worst outbreak of the disease in nearly 20 years. The story about measles spreading across the U.S. is unfolding alongside a parallel and troubling trend of increased measles infection rates globally. The World Health Organization issued a report at the same time as the CDC, finding that measles cases worldwide have surged by nearly four times the average number in the first three months of the year.
But the national and global trends spin a tale of two separate realities. An irrational fear of vaccines among well-educated and largely white Americans has fueled an utterly preventable and dangerous disease that had been considered “eliminated” by scientists. Reuters explained that “[a] growing and vocal fringe of parents in the United States oppose measles vaccines believing, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in the vaccines can cause autism or other disorders.” Michelle M. Mello, a professor of law at Stanford Law School and a professor of health research and policy at the Stanford University School of Medicine explained to me in an interview that while there have been pockets of low vaccination rates in minority communities—like Somali Americans in Minnesota or Orthodox Jews in New York City—“On a national level, overwhelmingly, the demographic is educated, relatively affluent white families” that are choosing not to vaccinate their children. The epicenters of measles outbreaks are in liberal states such as California, New York, Oregon and Washington.
Meanwhile, as an example of how the rest of the world struggles with a dangerous infectious disease, the East African island of Madagascar is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in history. More than 115,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed in a country of 25 million, and at least 1,200 people have so far died. The dead are mostly children under the age of 15. Less than 60% of that nation’s residents are vaccinated, but not because of a fear that vaccines cause autism. Instead they face a more traditional obstacle: poverty.
In Madagascar, mass malnutrition has helped the virus spread faster among young people with compromised immune systems. According to Associated Press, although the measles vaccine is free, “Simply reaching a clinic for help can be a challenge. Many people in Madagascar cannot afford to see a doctor or buy medicine, and health centers often are understaffed or have poorly qualified workers.”
It is a monumental ode to human stupidity that the wealthiest nation in the world teeters on the edge of a dangerous measles epidemic at the same time that poor nations are struggling to vaccinate their residents. It is worth contrasting the first-world problems of misinformed American parents who are literally organizing “measles parties” for their children with poverty-stricken families in nations like Madagascar.
Measles is not a disease to be taken as lightly as the so-called “anti-vaxxers” would have you believe. Mello explained, “This is not a disease where your [unvaccinated] kid has to share saliva or snot with another kid to get infected. You just have to be in a room where another person with measles has passed through in the last couple of hours to have a 90% chance of infection.” Although mortality rates from measles are low in a nation like the U.S., there can be long-lasting damage to health, including severe hearing loss. Yet there are hordes of American parents who are more terrified of vaccines than they are of measles.
There has been much hand-wringing in the U.S. about how best to approach the fiercely defended views of the anti-vaxxer crowd. Study after study conducted by reputable scientists and published in peer-reviewed journals confirm the same thing: Vaccines do not cause autism. Worse, an examination of how best to convince parents about the safety of vaccines had a depressing conclusion that “existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate.” In other words, anti-vaxxers are fact-resistant and, when presented with reality, dig their heels in even harder to maintain their fantasy.
If any of this sounds familiar, there is an analogy to be made between anti-vaxxers and climate-change deniers. Both groups place faith in a gut-level sense of their rightful position on an issue that has far-reaching existential implications. And both groups refuse to acknowledge the vast body of sound scientific literature proving them wrong. But on the issue of climate there is an encouraging trend showing that a significant percentage of Americans who once believed global warming wasn’t real are now accepting the science. One report found that about a fifth of those who had recently seen the light did so because they personally felt the impacts of climate change.
Where vaccination rates are concerned, we see the opposite trend. Federal officials released data late last year showing that the percentage of unvaccinated toddlers in the U.S. increased four-fold in the last 17 years. It is no wonder we are seeing outbreaks of a disease like measles. Mello explained that “In order for us to stop the spread and slow it to the rate where the outbreak actually extinguishes itself in relatively short order, we need about 95% of the population to receive the [measles] vaccine.” She issued a dire warning that “If it goes any lower than that, the very high rate of spread will cause the outbreak to take on a wildfire aspect.” Just as some have suggested that “climate-change deniers are a danger to our security,” there is a strong case to be made that anti-vaxxers are a threat to our collective health.
Perhaps it is a testament to the effectiveness of vaccines in the U.S. that has fueled the ignorance of just how necessary they are. We had more or less eliminated measles from the U.S. and have had similar levels of success in eradicating other infectious diseases through vaccinations. We no longer live in a world where a parent’s worst nightmare is their child contracting smallpox. But as vaccination rates drop, diseases are returning. The question is: Do we really need to wait for hardcore anti-vaxxers to come around once they see the fatal impacts of their choices?
Just as combating climate change requires strong policy solutions and laws to stop runaway warming, laws are needed to maintain the herd immunity our society relies on. The state of California passed a mandatory vaccination law banning parents from refusing vaccines based on their personal beliefs. While this has encouragingly led to increased vaccination rates, the rate of medical exemptions has also increased, suggesting that some physicians and parents are taking advantage of a loophole. More recently, New York City officials have taken even stricter measures—requiring mandatory vaccinations and barring unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the disease from being in public places.
There are, of course, limits to the analogy of climate change denialism and the beliefs of anti-vaxxers. But there is also a terrifying link. As our planet warms, scientists predict that infectious diseases like measles are more easily transmitted. In other words, two waves of ignorance could be colliding at this very moment to produce the kind of mayhem we have not seen in our lifetimes. At a time when we have so much information at our fingertips, could humanity’s downfall really be marked by such incomprehension and thick-headedness?","['stupidity', 'monumental', 'ode', 'human']"
"Protecting pregnant women, new mothers and children is about more than scoring political points with anti-choice legislation.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/mitch-mcconnell-s-efforts-restrict-abortion-won-t-end-until-ncna1143786?cid=public-rss_20200228,msnbc,abortion,left,42.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"This week the Senate will not be taking up legislation to lower health care or prescription drug costs. Nor will we be allowed to vote on bills to combat the opioid epidemic.

Instead, Republican leader Mitch McConnell prioritized a series of votes (that ultimately failed) aimed at limiting women's access to abortion and jailing doctors who provide constitutionally protected health care services for women around the country.
Yes, you read that right: The GOP wanted to jail doctors who perform abortions. The bills, if they had become law, would have allowed judges to sentence doctors to up to five years in prison.
Yes, this is happening in the United States. Yes, you should be outraged.
It is perfectly clear what's really at work here. These bills are dangerous and extreme and are part of a larger ongoing effort by the Trump administration to overturn Roe vs. Wade. And while they were authored by a pair of Republican senators from Nebraska and South Carolina, the proposed laws would affect every woman in every state.

Proponents of these efforts try to hide their motives by arguing that this type of legislation is necessary to prevent infanticide. That's a far cry from the truth, because — let's be very clear — infanticide is already illegal under federal law, as it absolutely should be. Anyone who says different is not telling the truth.
The first bill on so-called abortion survivors, introduced by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., was essentially a disinformation campaign disguised as legislation. If this bill had become law, it would have added medical uncertainty to the laws that are already on the books that outlaw infanticide, and it would have significantly complicated options for medical procedures to save the lives of mothers.
Abortions that are performed later in pregnancy are most often done as a result of severe fetal diagnoses and the serious risks that a pregnancy poses to the life of the woman. Getting an abortion under those circumstances isn't a decision any woman or family wants to be in a position to make; it is tragic, and it is heartbreaking. Yet this bill could subject doctors to up to five years in prison for helping patients during this time.
The second bill, introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would have banned all abortion access for women who have been pregnant for 20 weeks or more, and any doctors who violated the ban would have been sent to prison for up to five years. This is a clear violation of a woman's constitutionally protected right to receive abortion services, and courts have struck down similar bans.
Protecting pregnant women, new mothers and children is about more than scoring political points with anti-choice legislation. It's about ensuring that women have access to maternity care and affordable health care coverage.
We should be working together to invest in maternal and child health. The United States is one of the only developed countries where the maternal mortality rate is worse than it was 25 years ago. More than 700 moms in America die every year because of complications with a pregnancy, but more than 60 percent of those deaths are preventable. More than 21,000 infants die in the United States every year, and many of those deaths are preventable, too.
These numbers are heartbreaking, and we need to do better.
We should be improving access to quality maternal care and creating emergency protocols so any woman facing complications during pregnancy gets the care she needs. Medicaid health care programs are vitally important to low-income women, but unfortunately right now they cover moms for only 60 days after they give birth. That's not enough to support new moms or their children. We need to expand that coverage for new moms so they are covered for the entire first year.
Critically, we also need to crack down on junk health insurance plans, because these plans are not required to cover maternity care and can deny patients coverage because of their pre-existing conditions.
These measures could make a significant difference for American families. Unfortunately, Mitch McConnell won't let any of our bills that address these challenges come up for votes — just like he refuses to allow votes on so many important issues facing American families. Instead, he is championing these two bills that undermine women's reproductive health.
If this infuriates you, fight back. Donald Trump told us exactly what he was planning during his first campaign in 2016. ""There has to be some form of punishment"" for a woman who receives an abortion, he told MSNBC. A day later, he said punishing doctors who perform abortions should be the focus. And his allies in the Senate are doing everything they can to make that dangerous vision a reality.
The best defense against these abortion bans — and others like them — even passing is to replace the man in the White House and take back the Senate from Mitch McConnell. That's the only way to stop this assault on women's rights. Because at the end of the day, it really is this simple: Reproductive health decisions should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor and her family and not by Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump or the government.","['scoring', 'anti-choice', 'political', 'points']"
The failure to act to ameliorate global warming exposes the myth of human progress and the illusion that we are rational creatures. ,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/a-professor-of-astrophysics-explains-why-humans-are-on-the-path-to-self-destruction-not-the-first-time-theres-been-a-civilization-in-the-universe/,alternet,environment,left,42.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Editor’s note: The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed a former oil and mining industry lobbyist as secretary of the interior. President Donald Trump’s nomination of David Bernhardt, a government official during the George W. Bush administration, easily survived challenges by environmentally minded senators and others. It came amid rapidly mounting scientific evidence that global warming is an existential threat to huge numbers of species, including Homo sapiens.
In the reposted column below, first published on Truthdig on Aug. 19, 2018, Chris Hedges writes about climate change and interviews a scientist who is among the many warning about what they call the monumental damage that human-made emissions are causing to the atmosphere and the planet. Hedges will return with a new column next Monday.
The spectacular rise of human civilization—its agrarian societies, cities, states, empires and industrial and technological advances ranging from irrigation and the use of metals to nuclear fusion—took place during the last 10,000 years, after the last ice age. Much of North America was buried, before the ice retreated, under sheets eight times the height of the Empire State Building. This tiny span of time on a planet that is 4.5 billion years old is known as the Holocene Age. It now appears to be coming to an end with the refusal of our species to significantly curb the carbon emissions and pollutants that might cause human extinction. The human-induced change to the ecosystem, at least for many thousands of years, will probably make the biosphere inhospitable to most forms of life.
The planet is transitioning under our onslaught to a new era called the Anthropocene. This era is the product of violent conquest, warfare, slavery, genocide and the Industrial Revolution, which began about 200 years ago and saw humans start to burn a hundred million years of sunlight stored in the form of coal and petroleum. The numbers of humans climbed to over 7 billion. Air, water, ice and rock, which are interdependent, changed. Temperatures climbed. The Anthropocene, for humans and most other species, will most likely conclude with extinction or a massive die-off, as well as climate conditions that will preclude most known life forms. We engineered our march toward collective suicide although global warming was first identified in 1896 by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius.
The failure to act to ameliorate global warming exposes the myth of human progress and the illusion that we are rational creatures. We ignore the wisdom of the past and the stark scientific facts before us. We are entranced by electronic hallucinations and burlesque acts, including those emanating from the centers of power, and this ensures our doom. Speak this unpleasant truth and you are condemned by much of society. The mania for hope and magical thinking is as seductive in the Industrial Age as it was in pre-modern societies.
Ate and Nemesis were minor deities who were evoked in ancient Greek drama. Those infected with hubris, the Greeks warned, lost touch with the sacred, believed they could defy fate, or fortuna, and abandoned humility and virtue. They thought of themselves as gods. Their hubris blinded them to human limits and led them to carry out acts of suicidal folly, embodied in the god Ate. This provoked the wrath of the other gods. Divine retribution, in the form of Nemesis, led to tragedy and death and then restored balance and order, once those poisoned with hubris were eradicated. “Too late, too late you see the path of wisdom,” the Chorus in the play “Antigone” tells Creon, ruler of Thebes, whose family has died because of his hubris.
“We’re probably not the first time there’s been a civilization in the universe,” Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester and the author of “Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth,” told me when we met in New York.
“The idea that we’re destroying the planet gives us way too much credit,” he went on. “Certainly, we’re pushing the earth into a new era. If we look at the history of the biosphere, the history of life on earth, in the long run, the earth is just going to pick that up and do what is interesting for it. It will run new evolutionary experiments. We, on the other hand, may not be a part of that experiment.”
Civilizations probably have risen elsewhere in the universe, developed complex societies and then died because of their own technological advances. Every star in the night sky is believed to be circled by planets, some 10 billion trillion of which astronomers such as Frank Drake estimate are hospitable to life.
“If you develop an industrial civilization like ours, the route is going to be the same,” Adam Frank said. “You’re going to have a hard time not triggering climate change.”
Astronomers call the inevitable death of advanced civilizations across the universe “the great filter.” Robin Hanson in the essay “The Great Filter—Are We Almost Past It?” argues that advanced civilizations hit a wall or a barrier that makes continued existence impossible. The more that human societies evolve, according to Hanson, the more they become “energy intensive” and ensure their own obliteration. This is why, many astronomers theorize, we have not encountered other advanced civilizations in the universe. They destroyed themselves.
“For a civilization to destroy itself through nuclear war, it has to have certain emotional characteristics,” Frank said. “You can imagine certain civilizations saying, ‘I’m not building those [nuclear weapons]. Those are crazy.’ But climate change, you can’t get away from. If you build a civilization, you’re using huge amounts of energy. The energy feeds back on the planet, and you’re going to push yourself into a kind of Anthropocene. It’s probably universal.”
Frank said that our inability to project ourselves into a future beyond our own life spans makes it hard for us to grasp the reality and consequences of severe climate change. Scenarios for dramatic climate change often center around the year 2100, when most adults living now will be dead. Although this projection may turn out to be overly optimistic given the accelerating rate of climate change, it allows societies to ignore—because it is outside the life span of most living adults—the slow-motion tsunami that is occurring.
“We think we’re not a part of the biosphere—that we’re above it—that we’re special,” Frank said. “We’re not special.”
“We’re the experiment that the biosphere is running now,” he said. “A hundred million years ago, it was grassland. Grasslands were a new evolutionary innovation. They changed the planet, changed how the planet worked. Then the planet went on and did things with it. Industrial civilization is the latest experiment. We will keep being a part of that experiment or, with the way that we’re pushing the biosphere, it will just move on without us.”
“We have been sending probes to every other planet in the solar system for the last 60 years,” he said. “We have rovers running around on Mars. We’ve learned generically how planets work. From Venus, we’ve learned about the runaway greenhouse effect. On Venus the temperature is 800 degrees. You can melt lead [there]. Mars is a totally dry, barren world now. But it used to have an ocean. It used to be a blue world. We have models that can predict the climate. I can predict the weather on Mars tomorrow via these climate models. People who think the only way we can understand climate is by studying the earth now, that’s completely untrue. These other worlds—Mars, Venus, Titan. Titan is a moon of Saturn that has an amazingly rich atmosphere. They all teach us how to think like a planet. They have taught us generically how planets behave.”
Frank points out that much of the configurations of the ecosystem on which we depend have not always been part of the planet’s biosphere. This includes the Gulf Stream, which carries warm water and warm air up from Florida to Boston and out across the Atlantic.
“Hundreds of millions of people in some of Earth’s most technologically advanced cities rely on the mild climate delivered by the Gulf Stream,” Frank writes in “Light of the Stars.” “But the Gulf Stream is nothing more than a particular circulation pattern formed during a particular climate state the Earth settled into after the last ice age ended. It is not a permanent fixture of the planet.”
“Everything we think about the earth just happens to be this one moment we found it in,” he told me. “We’re pushing it [the planet] and we’re pushing it hard. We don’t have much time to make these transitions. What people have to understand is that climate change is our cosmic adolescence. We should have expected this. The question is not ‘did we change the climate?’ It’s ‘of course we changed the climate. What else did you expect to have happened?’ We’re like a teenager who has been given this power over ourselves. Just like how you give a teenager the keys to the car, there’s this moment where you’re like, ‘Oh my God I hope you make it.’ And that’s what we are.”
“Climate change is not a problem we have to make go away, in a sense that you don’t make adolescence go away,” Frank said. “It is a dangerous transition that you have to navigate. … The question is are we smart enough to deal with the effects of our own power? Climate change is not a pollution problem. It’s not like any environmental problem we’ve faced before. In some sense, it’s not an environmental problem but a planetary transition. We’ve already pushed the earth into it. We’re going to have to evolve a new way of being a civilization, fundamentally.”
“We will either evolve those group behaviors quickly or the earth will take what we’ve given it, in terms of new climate states, and move on and create new species,” he said.
Frank said the mathematical models for the future of the planet have three trajectories. One is a massive die-off of perhaps 70 percent of the human population and then an uneasy stabilization. The second is complete collapse and extinction. The third is a dramatic reconfiguration of human society to protect the biosphere and make it more diverse and productive not for human beings but for the health of the planet. This would include halting our consumption of fossil fuels, converting to a plant-based diet and dismantling the animal agriculture industry as well as greening deserts and restoring rainforests.
There is, Frank warned, a tipping point when the biosphere becomes so degraded no human activity will halt runaway climate change. He cites Venus again.","['myth', 'illusion']"
Inhibiting travel and commerce—not to mention making consular interviews deeply intrusive on a gendered basis—by imposing restrictions on pregnant women is an alarmist reaction to a small issue.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/how-the-birth-tourist-became-trumps-latest-bogeyman/,alternet,immigration,left,42.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"This analysis was originally published by the Niskanen Center.
In January, the Trump administration adopted a new rule that would establish the presumption that pregnant women visiting the United States are “birth tourists” — women whose primary intention in visiting the country is to get U.S. citizenship for their babies. While the new presumption is rebuttable, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove that is not, in fact, her intention. It will undoubtedly make it more difficult for many women to visit the United States for legitimate reasons.
So just how prevalent is “birth tourism”? The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimated that there were approximately 33,000 “women who came to America specifically to have a child and then left once the child was born” between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2017. That figure (or their similar estimate for an earlier year) found its way into the New York Times, the Washington Post, the BBC, and many other mainstream outlets.
The trouble is, this figure is an egregious overestimate. There are good reasons to doubt CIS’s method for estimating birth tourism in the first place. But if we are going to use CIS’s proposed method, then we should think the number of birth tourists is less than 2,000.
How did CIS arrive at 33,000?
CIS arrived at the 33,000 figure in 5 steps:
1. First, they used the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) to estimate the number of foreign-born women in the United States on July 1, 2017, who gave birth in the preceding 12 months.
2. Second, they estimated the number of births to foreign-born mothers over the same interval using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adjusting the CDC’s annual figures for foreign-born mothers in 2016 and 2017 with the monthly variations in total birth rates.
3. Third, they took the difference between the numbers from steps 1 and 2, reasoning that if the CDC figure is higher, it is because some mothers had left the country and were thus not counted in the census survey.
4. Fourth, they used the ACS to determine what proportion of women in step 1 were U.S. citizens.
5. Finally, they adjusted their estimate from step 3 downwards using the proportion found in step 4 to eliminate mothers who cannot possibly be birth tourists on account of being citizens.
The values CIS reported on each step are summarized in the second column of the table below:
CIS’s reported valuesReplicating CIS’s methodExcluding new mothers with at least 2 years of U.S. residence
1. NACS854,896870,970870,970
2. NCDC897,223897,223897,223
3. N=NCDC-NACS51,327*26,25326,253
4. ρ.35.36.93
5. (1-ρ)N33,36316,845†1,811†
* Note: 51,327 is the figure reported by CIS. The actual difference is 42,327, which would make the final estimate in the last row 27,512 rather than 33,363.
†Also note: final estimates may not exactly equal (1-ρ)N for the reported value of ρ because of rounding
What went wrong?
Attempting to replicate CIS’s calculations raised a number of issues. An arithmetical error was made in step 3, when they use 51,327 as the difference between 897,223 and 854,896; the correct difference is 42,327. While assuredly an honest mistake, this alone causes their final estimate of over 33,000 to be over 20 percent higher than what it would have otherwise been (27,513).
In addition, I have been unable to replicate the number CIS gave as the ACS estimate for foreign-born mothers of children born between July 1st, 2016 and July 1st 2017. This is not necessarily a problem if CIS can provide more information that will allow us to replicate their ACS estimate. However, based on the existing information provided by CIS on the calculation, my analysis of ACS data finds 870,970 foreign-born women who gave birth in the preceding year, rather than 854,896. This would lead to a final estimate of 16,845, about half of CIS’s reported estimate.
Most importantly, the CIS estimate includes mothers who arrived in the United States long before they became pregnant. In fact, new mothers who CIS identifies as potential birth tourists had already been in the United States for 13 years, on average. The ACS shows that less than 40 percent of new mothers were citizens, the only basis CIS uses to exclude foreign-born mothers who are not birth tourists. But the ACS also reveals that over 90 percent had already been in the United States for at least two years — necessarily over a year before they became pregnant — and therefore cannot possibly be birth tourists. Excluding new mothers who are long-term residents of the United States would mean an estimate of fewer than 2,000 potential birth tourists, only about one-twentieth of CIS’s figure.
Inhibiting travel and commerce—not to mention making consular interviews deeply intrusive on a gendered basis—by imposing restrictions on pregnant women is an alarmist reaction to a small issue.

"There may be pushback among Democrats. If so, I hope the ones doing the pushing will reconsider. We have treated our younger generations, and many older people, unjustly. The act of recognizing an injustice we hadn’t seen before makes us more human and refines us as moral beings.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/06/bernie-got-it-right-full-student-debt-cancellation-is-the-best-approach/,alternet,student-debt,left,43.0,4.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, together with Representatives Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal, has introduced a dramatic reform package on college affordability. It goes far beyond anything proposed so far, both in its scope and in its potential to reshape the way Americans think about their society and government.
One bill in the package, Rep. Omar’s Student Debt Cancellation Act, would cancel all outstanding student debt. That’s a $1.6 trillion burden affecting more than 45 million people. This bill will benefit people in all demographic groups, communities, and walks of life. That fact is illustrated by the fact that, as Sen. Sanders introduces the bill in the Senate, eight representatives of color (including Rep. Omar) will simultaneously introduce it in the House.
The reform package also includes Sen. Sanders’ College for All Act, which provides tuition-free higher education to every qualified American without any additional work requirements, restrictions, or tests for family financial eligibility.
An Unfair Deal
Both ideas are transformative. But, of the two proposals, it is student debt cancellation that’s likely to trigger the most vigorous debate. That’s a good thing, because it can lead to both a teaching moment and an opportunity for reflection.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for partial student debt cancellation began a productive national conversation. But the Omar/Sanders proposal, with its full and universal cancellation for tens of millions of people trapped by student debt, gives us an opportunity: to re-examine our social contract, our awareness of the public good, and our fundamental ideas about equity and fairness.
Some people’s first response to the idea of canceling all student debt is to think that it’s a step too far. Why not just cancel part of the debt, for some of the debt holders, as Sen. Warren’s proposal does? Freedom to Prosper, an activist group that was instrumental in laying the groundwork for full debt cancellation*, offers useful data and analysis on the benefits of full cancellation on its website.
But the most important argument for full cancellation is a moral one. Low-cost or tuition-free higher education was available for many years in the United States, in many parts of the country. A series of public policy choices shifted this cost onto individual students, who were promised that their “investment” would pay off in higher earnings.
Neither the policy change nor the promise was fair to students or their families. It was wrong to shift society’s shared responsibility of educating its citizens onto individuals. And it was wrong to make them a promise that, as we now know, never came true. As Julie Margetta Morgan and Marshall Steinbaum wrote for the Roosevelt Institute, “More education has not led to higher earnings over time.”
A Plan for Everyone
President Obama put it well in his final State of the Union address when he said, “No hardworking student should be stuck in the red.” Partial cancellation would leave millions trapped in the red for the foreseeable future.
Some people have expressed concern that full cancellation could reward wealthier—and whiter—people, who are less in need than others. But full cancellation will reduce the racial wealth gap. Economist Marshall Steinbaum concluded that the elimination of all student debt would reduce that gap in younger households from a 12:1 advantage for whites to 5:1—a ratio that is still unconscionably and immorally high, and must be addressed by other policies. But this figure shows that full cancellation lessens the harm. When taken as a whole, this college affordability reform package is likely to significantly improve racial injustice in our economy.
In that case, why not target the program to lower-income people, as Warren’s plan would? First, because truly wealthy people don’t generally have student debt. They write checks for college tuition. If they become wealthy after graduation, their financial advisers will almost certainly tell them to pay off student debt in full. After all, student debt terms are far less favorable than those available to “high net worth individuals.”
Why cancel debt for everyone? First, because many of us have long believed those things we hold most precious—our parks, our security, and our access to knowledge—should be freely available to all. These borrowers were denied that access. That’s an historical injustice we should make right.
Secondly, everyone who holds student debt has been wronged by our country’s shift away from tuition-free public education, and by the false promises that accompanied that shift.
Making it right will benefit more than the 45 million borrowers and their families. A report from the Levy Institute showed that full student debt cancellation will create more than a million jobs, and significant economic growth, over a period of several years.
That number becomes considerably smaller, by hundreds of thousands of jobs, under a limited plan like Sen. Warren’s. In effect, the limited program deprives thousands of blue-collar Americans of jobs they would otherwise have under full cancellation. That’s a price they shouldn’t have to pay, especially if it’s motivated by an exaggerated fear that somehow, somewhere, a well-to-do orthodontist is getting a break she doesn’t deserve.
The Policy and the Politics
The politics of this issue are compelling. Polling on full cancellation is surprisingly strong, as seen in a recent survey conducted by Data for Progress (DFP) and published by Freedom to Prosper. And full cancellation, of the kind proposed by Rep. Omar and Sen. Sanders, helps more people. In general, the broader the population affected by policies—in this case, by full cancellation and tuition-free higher education—the larger the “army” willing to fight for them.
These proposals also benefit from their simplicity. Democrats, as is well known, tend to over-engineer their policies. They make you, in the words of an old Godfather joke, an offer you can’t understand.
In the case of student debt cancellation, they also force people to make painful choices: Does a young couple put off getting married to get their student debt reduced? Do they wait another year before taking good jobs, so that they qualify? Must a struggling young person stay away from his parents’ home and couch-surf for a year to obtain the benefit?
Conclusion
The clear and simple structure of this plan will make it easier to explain to the public. It will help more people, and it will help them more thoroughly. And it will give progressives the opportunity to remind Americans of a time when the country understood the value of the public good—when it was understood that the government looked to unite society through common investment in, and benefit from, publicly provided goods and services.
There may be pushback among Democrats. If so, I hope the ones doing the pushing will reconsider. We have treated our younger generations, and many older people, unjustly. The act of recognizing an injustice we hadn’t seen before makes us more human and refines us as moral beings.
This moral context, along with the inexorable mathematics of social and economic justice, makes the Omar/Sanders bill an important and profound proposal that deserves broad support.

Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old” — the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.
Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season — already poisoned by last year’s Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal — is up for grabs. Certainly, the proposed plan to turn stadiums in the Phoenix, Arizona, area into the sports equivalent of a vast movie set for the games of all 30 major league teams (to be played without fans) seems far-fetched at best.
But football, now the true national pastime, is another matter.
In sports terms, as in so much else in coronaviral America, these are desperately deprived times, even for casual fans. There will be intense pressure — and not only from the president’s base — for that sport’s return. For many people, mostly men, it’s the sustaining soap opera that has always carried them into the next week and the one after that, a porn-ish escape hatch from work and family, a currency of communication with other men, an eternal connection to a non-demanding hive.
Games for Lives?
Without professional (or even college) sports right now or realistically in the near future, fans feel even more unmoored in lives that, for all of us, are distinctly adrift. As they become edgier, it’s a reasonable bet (or at least my hope) that they will also become more open to questioning Trump’s mismanagement — or, to put it more bluntly, sacrifice — of their lives. Recent polls already seem to reflect this, with the latest Gallup Poll showing the steepest approval decline of his presidency.
The president, I suspect, fears just this, though perhaps, in the end, the hole in everyday life where sports once was may only reinforce fans’ sense (like the president’s) that the games are too important not to bring back, safety be damned. Certainly, Trump and other Republican politicians have already been willing enough to forfeit lives to boost their reelection chances.
The values and sensibilities of football are, of course, Trumpist in nature. That’s why former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s demonstration against racism — performed in a kind of public isolation — elicited such a harsh reaction from the president in the now-distant pre-pandemic era. That’s why the sport’s billionaire owners, predominantly Trump donors, shunned Kaepernick (although some of their teams could have used his skills). They didn’t dare to, or care to, give him another platform, not in an era when “president” and “racism” were becoming synonymous.
Even more tellingly, in an understandable but still disappointing me-first display, few of Kaepernick’s fellow players, most of whom are also African-American, supported him publicly. After years of being celebrated as America’s “warriors” and “role models,” they came up desperately short when it counted. Compare them to healthcare workers and other front-line heroes of this pandemic and you’ll realize just how far short they fell of even the most modest form of everyday bravery.
Not that, when it comes to pro sports, football was such an outlier. As activism goes, baseball, a sport that once produced transcendent progressive heroes like Jackie Robinson, Jim Bouton, and Curt Flood, has been eerily quiet in recent years. It’s a sport that the president has paid relatively little attention to — except for suggesting recently that Pete Rose, banned from baseball for life for betting on the Cincinnati Reds while he was that team’s manager, should be allowed into its Hall of Fame.
How Trumpian was that? Such betting is, of course, strictly forbidden for active players and managers who are obviously privy to inside information. But, hey, does disregarding inconvenient rules to profit from a privileged position ring any bells these days in Washington?
Trump has, in fact, been uncharacteristically silent on the recent revelation that during the 2017 season, the World Series winners, the Houston Astros, concealed a video camera in center field to steal the pitching signs of opposing teams. That’s also illegal. Major League baseball punished the team by suspending its manager and general manager for a year, imposing a $5 million fine on its owners, and taking away its first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021.
For some fans and commentators, the Astros’ punishment was too severe or too mild. Opposing players, feeling victimized by the scheme, thought specific Astros should have been penalized, too. Yet such cheating is hardly new. In 1951, the “shot heard round the world,” a famed home-run that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants and sent them to the World Series, was linked to the stealing of signs from the Brooklyn Dodgers through a hand-held telescope. Only the technology has improved.
A Changing National Pastime
Once baseball’s opening day passed without a pitch this April, proof that the plague was winning, the Phoenix Plan was floated. It would require all major league players and employees to be sequestered in that area and continually tested at a moment when tests might still not be universally available. But, hey, haven’t VIP Jocks always gone to the head of the line? (Actually, a massive study of 10,000 Major League Baseball employees, from players to popcorn vendors, being conducted by Stanford University and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory to find out how many contracted and may have recovered from the virus has already gotten access to such testing kits at a time when even some front-line workers can’t get them!)
For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As the country reeled from the revelation of President Bill Clinton’s sexual liaison with a White House intern and with his impeachment just around the corner, a feel-good legend was born. A white man and a brown man rose in friendly rivalry to break the 37-year-old record of 61 home runs by Roger Maris, who, in turn, had bested Babe Ruth’s famed 60 in 1927.
The good-natured competition between Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals (who won with 70 homers) and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs (66) was, at the time, celebrated as a balm that should soothe the country. And perhaps for many fans it did indeed serve as a comforting distraction in a difficult political moment.
But that summer’s golden glow soon faded as both players were reported to have taken steroids to muscle up. McGwire would admit it years later; Sosa would not. (A dark-skinned Dominican, he further complicated his legend by bleaching his skin to whiten himself, as if in anticipation of the Trumpian racial preferences to come.) Their contemporary, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, would eventually become the single-season home run leader with 73, but has never shaken rumors that he, too, used steroids.
Nor did baseball ever fully recover its sense of primacy as the national pastime or its sense of righteousness as one of America’s first major institutions to integrate. In fact, the sport is still overwhelmingly white and skewed toward an older audience, as well as slow and outdated in an era of tweeting speed.
Which is why, whether or not baseball opens this season in a vast sports self-isolation experiment, the key to President Trump’s future lies in his perverse relationship with the National Football League. That goes back more than 30 years to the moment he tried unsuccessfully (as with so many other business ventures) to elbow his way into the sport. Give him credit, though: ever attuned to the public mood, he did sense the rise of a new national pastime.
Bet On This
One reason for the NFL’s growing popularity is the way it uses college football as its minor leagues and early showcase for pro players (though possibly not this fall). For a passionate pro football fan, it’s a pleasure to see the stars of tomorrow in the making. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. In a recent commentary in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Nathan Kalman-Lamb of Duke opines that high-revenue men’s football and basketball “will become more valuable than ever as an enticement to lure steep tuition from students.”
And here’s an innovation that the president would glory in, one that would make post-pandemic football an even greater success: the addition of real-time nationwide legal gambling on games. Just imagine the sort of Trump-donor dollars that would be stacked up to support such a future industry. After all, estimations are that illegal gambling on pro and college football is already a $93 billion business. Legal or not, it’s an integral part of the fan experience (though in the post-pandemic world there will be a lot less money in so many pockets to gamble with).
The dream of easily accessible, high-tech legal gambling has been lurking on the sidelines for years. All that’s necessary to make it come true is for Congress to reverse the 1992 Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act, the federal law that bans it in most states. And the pandemic moment may prove perfect for just that, for “reopening” football in a new and even more Trumpian way, allowing fans to sit at home and bet what money they have left on games in progress: Will that field goal attempt split the uprights? Will Tom Brady in his new Tampa Bay Buccaneers uniform make that crucial third-down conversion?
However, to reopen pro football, as the president would wish, to make life seem “normal” again, stadiums might have to remain empty (or partially empty). Imagine, for instance, if San Francisco had actually beaten Kansas City (which it didn’t) in the Super Bowl on the first Sunday in February and the expected championship parade had followed a few days later, drawing a million people to that city’s streets. It might have proved an early version of Mardi Gras (a 2020 coronaviral disaster of a get-together).
Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time. From the huddle to tackling, the game is, in every way, a potential disease transmitter. The only example of social distancing (besides Kaepernick kneeling alone) I can even remember might have been the 1958 West Point football team, which fielded a “lonesome end,” Bill Carpenter. On every play, he set himself up near the far sideline in an innovative formation. He never even joined the huddle and that team went undefeated.
If it proves impossible to stage football games, given social-distancing rules, the inevitable sport of the future is already waiting in the wings. Just under the radar of most of the middle-aged and elderly, especially those without access to children, is a fiercely contested, already commodified, fan-friendly industry with championships, heroes, endorsement contracts, and a ready market for expensive gear. I’m thinking, as you may have guessed, of competitive online video games, or esports. (Think of it as the revenge of the nerds.) No matter what Donald Trump does, sooner rather than later they’re likely to replace the old up-close-and-contagious live games.
It’s not hard to imagine a future in which individual competitors, regional and national teams, leagues, or even some version of the Olympics, would be watched by millions on streaming platforms on home screens and, once social distancing becomes a historical footnote, on the screens of sports bars as well, if not theaters and arenas. While combat games like Fortnite and Call of Duty, along with sports knock-offs like Madden and NBA Live, currently dominate esports, the future will undoubtedly include brainier fare that will turn art, architecture, banking, diplomacy, music, and maybe even poetry into online competitions even Nike and Google could sponsor.
Esports already supports ESPN-style commentary. There might even be room someday for a new reality show about them hosted by a motor-mouthed, pumpkin-headed former one-term president.
Who needs football after all? It would, in fact, be the definition of madness to launch a football season in a coronaviral world. But that doesn’t mean Donald Trump won’t push for just that. The advisory board he appointed for the reopening of sports includes, as my colleague Dave Zirin points out, “a group of brigands defined by their lack of care in normal times for the safety and well-being of their employees.”
It’s Trump’s dream team because, to win in November, he needs an America in which the National Football League is back in business big time. For him it’s open arms for the NFL, which could mean open season on the rest of us.

"But there’s also an intensifying global climate crisis, which carries life-changing risks for billions of people.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/team-trump-keeps-taking-the-climate-conversation-backwards,msnbc,environment,left,43.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Now that Andrew Wheeler has made the transition from energy lobbyist to head of Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, he has a few priorities. If his remarks at the National Press Club yesterday were any indication, changing public perceptions is near the top of his to-do list. Here’s how Wheeler began his remarks:
“Since this is the National Press Club I would be remiss not to use this opportunity to address my friends in the media. “Every year since 2001, Gallup has conducted polling on the same question do you think the quality of the environment and the country as a whole is getting better or getting worse. Every year since 2001, more people have said getting worse than getting better often by large margins. We need to fix this perception and we need the help of the press. The public needs to know how far we’ve come as a nation protecting the environment and here are a few environmental indicators that need to get more attention.”
The former lobbyist added that American news organizations do “a disservice to the American public and sound policymaking by not informing the public of the progress this nation has made.”
Wheeler concluded with a top-five list of things “the press consistently gets wrong.” First up, according to the conservative EPA chief, is that “the environment is getting worse.”
Wheeler’s emphasis was on improvements to air quality, and on this, he’s correct. Air pollution was a more serious problem in the United States in the recent past, and efforts to address pollution have been largely successful.
For those of us who breathe, that’s certainly good news. It’s also evidence of the kind of benefits that result from concerted governmental action.
And if Americans’ environmental concerns were related solely to air quality, Trump’s EPA would have reason to brag. But there’s also an intensifying global climate crisis, which carries life-changing risks for billions of people.
It was not, however, the central point of Wheeler’s remarks. That’s probably because the Trump administration doesn’t much care about climate change and routinely downplays its existence.
Indeed, the president met yesterday with Prince Charles, who takes the climate crisis seriously, and who apparently tried to persuade Trump to do the same. Those efforts, according to the president himself, were in vain.
Trump described the conversation during an interview with Piers Morgan, who asked what Prince Charles said. “What he really wants and what he really feels warmly about is the future,” Trump responded. “He wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good climate as opposed to a disaster. And I agree.”
So far, so good.
But Trump then added, “I did say, well, the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are, based on all statistics, and it’s even getting better. Because I agree with that. I want the best water, the cleanest water. Crystal clean, has to be crystal clean air.”
In other words, the president is clumsily trying to do what Andrew Wheeler has tried to do: confronted with a global environmental crisis, Trump and his team would prefer to change the subject to something more pleasant.
The problem, however, is that the president’s pitch is effectively incoherent. Asked about climate change, Trump talked about air and water quality. Obviously, air and water quality are important, but they’re also beside the point.
When Morgan tried to press Trump on whether he understands the most basic elements of the climate crisis, and whether the American president “accepts” the scientific consensus, the Republican replied, “I believe that there’s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways.” Trump added that “climate change” used to be called “global warming” but “that wasn’t working.”
As a Washington Post analysis noted in response, “This isn’t true and doesn’t make much sense.”
We don’t appear to have time for such nonsense.","['intensifying', 'life-changing']"
A slew of other world leaders and senior officials lined up to express their dismay over what they said was Trump's willingness to hamper the WHO just when the world needs it the most.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/global-criticism-grows-trump-move-end-who-funding-amid-pandemic-n1184146,msnbc,coronavirus,left,44.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
President Donald Trump's move to halt funding to the World Health Organization has been met with severe criticism at home and abroad, with the United Nations secretary-general saying ""now is not the time"" for such a drastic move while the coronavirus pandemic is gripping the globe.
Trump made the announcement Tuesday pending a review of the WHO's response to the initial coronavirus outbreak in China. He claims the agency has been too close to Beijing and covered up for its mistakes.
Congressional Democrats are disputing the president's authority to do this. Republican lawmakers are planning their own investigation, examining the early response by the WHO and the Chinese government.
""Now is a time for unity in the global battle to push the COVID-19 pandemic into reverse, not a time to cut the resources of the World Health Organization, which is spearheading and coordinating the global body's efforts,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement Tuesday.
China expressed ""deep concern"" about Trump's announcement, its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said at a news briefing.
""As the most authoritative and most professional organization, the World Health Organization has played an irreplaceable role in global public health crisis,"" Zhao said. ""The decision of the U.S. will undercut the ability of the WHO and damage the global cooperation of fighting the epidemic.""
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted similar misgivings.
Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to @WHO. There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain & mitigate the #coronavirus pandemic. Only by joining forces we can overcome this crisis that knows no borders. — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) April 15, 2020
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov slammed Trump’s move as ""a very selfish approach."" He told the TASS news agency, ""We urge the United States to abandon further attacks on the WHO and pursue a responsible line.""
And Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the African Union Commission, called the decision ""deeply regrettable.""

It's not just governments and international organizations that have lined up to express dismay at Trump's move. Experts, entrepreneurs and others have also been quick to condemn the announcement.
Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told his 50 million Twitter followers that halting the WHO's funding was ""as dangerous as it sounds.""
""Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped, no other organization can replace them,"" Gates tweeted. ""The world needs the WHO now more than ever.""
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Reuters, ""The move sends the wrong message during the middle of a pandemic."" While the WHO has made mistakes in the past, he added, ""it's not the middle of a pandemic that you do this type of thing.""
And Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, described Trump's move as ""a crime against humanity."" He tweeted that ""every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.""
A slew of other world leaders and senior officials lined up to express their dismay over what they said was Trump's willingness to hamper the WHO just when the world needs it the most.
The U.S. is the world's largest financial contributor to the organization, accounting for roughly 15 percent of its budget. Trump has said that amounts to some $500 million each year.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that ascribing blame ""does not help"" because ""the virus knows no borders. We have to closely work together.""
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that ""at time like this when we need to be sharing information and we need to have advice we can rely on, the WHO has provided that.""
Not everyone was quite so scathing. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he sympathized with some of Trump's criticisms of the WHO, but nevertheless said now was not the time ""to throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and hobble the agency at a time of global crisis.

Trump has accused the WHO of ""severely mismanaging and covering up"" the coronavirus crisis, specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. He also claimed that the WHO ""pushed China's misinformation about the virus ... and there was no need for travel bans.""
He took particular issue with the agency's criticism of his order to temporarily deny entry to the U.S. by most foreign nationals who had recently been in China. The order was issued Jan. 31, when China was the center of the outbreak.

The agency was informed of the first cases Dec. 31. The next day, it requested information from Chinese officials, and the Wuhan market where the outbreak is believed to have originated was closed for disinfection, according to a WHO report.
Then, on Jan. 30, it declared a global health emergency as the number of cases hit 10,000.
Trump's move to halt funding for the agency that oversees international public health has raised questions about whether it could affect efforts by other countries to curtail coronavirus cases.
Dr. Patrice Harris, the president of the American Medical Association, excoriated the president in a statement Tuesday for making the move ""during the worst public health crisis in a century.""
""Cutting funding to the WHO — rather than focusing on solutions — is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world,"" Harris said. ""The AMA is deeply concerned by this decision and its wide-ranging ramifications, and we strongly urge the President to reconsider.""","['hamper', 'dismay', 'willingness']"
"Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/worse-than-a-preschooler-donald-trump-is-failing-the-marshmallow-test/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,44.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Fifty years ago, in a now-classic experiment, Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel and his colleagues presented preschoolers with a plate of treats and a dilemma: They could have one marshmallow now or wait 20 minutes and get two marshmallows later.
The kids who managed to wait (despite a plateful of temptation in front of them) turned out to be generally more successful than their more impatient peers. Their grades were better, their SAT scores were higher, they were healthier and socially better-adjusted. The experiment set off an explosion of scholarship on the benefits of delayed gratification, perseverance, and “grit.” It’s one reason “self-mastery” and “self-control” are part of almost every kindergartener’s curriculum today.
America is now facing something like a national Marshmallow Test. Many states are pushing to reopen their economies, even with plentiful evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As summer beckons and restrictions loosen, citizens will have to judge just how far they’ll reach for a taste of pre-pandemic normalcy, whether it’s a trip to the salon, a carefree cookout with friends, or a night out at the theater. More challenging, people will have to maintain the discipline of social distancing until the virus is genuinely under control. It might be tantalizing to forego some of the summer’s most sought-after activities—like a trip to the beach—but the most abstemious countries will have greater rewards down the line. No doubt, those that persevere in taming the virus will claim the prize of lasting economic stability.
President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. Worse than the preschooler who succumbs to a single marshmallow, Trump would stuff his face and then smash the plate.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. Barely two weeks after declaring a national emergency in mid-March, he said he hoped to see “packed churches” by Easter and started urging the return of professional sports with full stadiums. As cases mounted a month later, Trump tweeted to “liberate” three states from lockdown restrictions, encouraging rebellions against governors’ efforts to stop the spread of infection. Then, in late May, as U.S. deaths edged toward the ominous threshold of 100,000, Trump called on churches to hold in-person services, contradicting state bans on mass gatherings, declaring them “essential.”
Consistently, he has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly hasn’t spoken to Trump in two weeks. All of these comments and actions have delayed the day when true normalcy will arrive, if not sabotaged it altogether.
For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.
Public health officials have repeatedly warned against the lifting of restrictions prematurely, especially when many states still lack the testing and contact tracing infrastructure necessary to tamp down inevitable outbreaks. Adding to these worries is the possibility of a new wave, sparked by this week’s mass protests and the gatherings over Memorial Day weekend. The worst-case scenario, scientists say, is a resurgence of the virus this fall in combination with the seasonal flu. The coming months, as ousted vaccine official Rick Bright recently told Congress, could be the “darkest winter in modern history.” Nevertheless, states are vaulting over the federal government’s metrics for a safe reopening in a race to restart their economies. As of June 3, 16 states were reporting a rise in new infections, a number that’s likely to tick upward.
Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Rather than tackle immigration reform, Trump opted for the cheap optics of “building a wall,” a colossal waste of tax-payer money. Rather than negotiate a sensible agreement with China over its unfair trade practices, he levied a series of ill-considered tariffs and set off a trade war that has put U.S.-China relations on its worst footing in decades. And instead of investing in the painstaking work of tamping down COVID-19, he’s scapegoated the World Health Organization and repeatedly touted an anti-malaria drug that doesn’t treat the disease and is now shown to increase the likelihood of death.
The next few months will pose a crucial test of our national resolve and set the country’s trajectory for years to come. Americans need a leader who is honest about the difficulties that lie ahead, undaunted by the scale of the task, and willing to do take on the arduous job of navigating the nation’s recovery. In other words, they need the exact opposite of Trump.
In his speech announcing the moon shot, President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Rebuilding a post-pandemic America will be one of the hardest tasks the nation has ever had to face. Unlike the moon shot, with its aspiration and glamour, the goal will be the simple restoration of a life with some semblance to what we had before.
Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.","['hampered', 'restlessness']"
"But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trumps-refusal-to-wear-a-mask-isnt-just-vanity-its-a-manifestation-of-his-fascism/,alternet,coronavirus,left,44.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Despite knowing full well the furor that Vice President Mike Pence raised by not wearing a mask during a Mayo Clinic visit in late April, Donald Trump refused to wear a mask when visiting Honeywell factory in Arizona earlier this week — a factory that makes masks. This wasn’t just a symbolic nose-thumbing at people’s reasonable desire to be safe. Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were putting the lives of Honeywell employees in danger.
After all, masks are not primarily meant to protect the mask-wearer, but to protect others, since there’s clear evidence that people who are infected but have no symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Trump is regularly exposed to the virus, in fact — one of his personal valets just tested positive — and is a prime candidate to be such a carrier.
Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.”
“The president said doing so would make it seem like he is preoccupied with health instead of focused on reopening the nation’s economy,” the AP reporters write.
This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear. But there’s also good reason to believe that the Trump-Pence antipathy to wearing masks signals to something deeper and darker.
Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, in her friendly competition with fellow host Tucker Carlson to see who can be the most obnoxious, has started to demonize mask-wearing by claiming that public health advisories are somehow a conspiracy to sow “fear and intimidation.”
(Considering that mask-wearing to protect others took off in Asia long before Trump even ran for president, Ingraham’s conspiracy theory doesn’t possess even the most remote logical consistency.)
Between Trump and Fox News, the practice of mask-wearing is swiftly becoming another culture-war flashpoint. But the question is why. After all, masks seem to make people feel more comfortable with going out in public and going to work, and those are both things Trump dearly wants Americans to return to doing.
But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation. (Many have noted that this same argument could be made against the practice of wearing pants.)
Ultimately, the rejection of mask-wearing really goes back to the fact that Trump, Ingraham and their most faithful followers are guided by fascist impulse, even when they don’t or can’t articulate a fully fleshed-out fascist ideology. Above all other things, the fascist personality is one that rejects even the possibility of sickness. To wear a mask is to publicly admit that one’s body is suspectible to illness, which is coded as “weak” and therefore unacceptable.
Natascha Strobl, an Austrian political scientist who is an expert in far-right organizing and rhetoric, had an important English-language Twitter thread in early April about why the far right was embracing the view that the coronavirus should simply be allowed to run wild. From the beginning, this has been the view Trump clearly prefers on an emotional level and has pushed federal policy toward all along. While Strobl didn’t mention masks, her observations also help explain why these same folks are repulsed by mask-wearing.
The fascist narrative, Strobl explained, is that “men aren’t men anymore, but nervous, urban, overly intellectualized and (here it comes) sickly weaklings.
“Weakness is never worthy of protection and has to be cast out. This is fascism,” she continues. The fascist believes that those viewed as “weak” have an obligation to die “without protest for the greater good” and that if “they don’t do it, they are weak and the weak drag everyone else down and therefore must be done away with.”
To wear a mask, in other words, indicates a belief that your personal body can become infected. A fascist-minded person like Trump cannot admit such a thing, either because he genuinely believes he is too strong to be affected by the virus or because he fears looking weak in public. Just as important, wearing a mask indicates care and concern for others, especially those who are high-risk. But the fascist-minded person doesn’t want to protect those viewed as “weak” — in fact, those people are expected to die so as not to be a burden on others. As Strobl points out, the far right believes that by becoming seriously ill or dying in service to some warped conception of the greater good, the “weak” can prove themselves strong through their sacrifice.
Trump hasn’t exactly concealed his impulse to see the coronavirus as a force that culls the herd of its weakest members, or to perceive that the “weak” can be redeemed through this morbid, sadistic ritual sacrifice. This week, he repeatedly insisted that Americans should think of themselves as “warriors” who bravely go forth and face the virus for the cause of, well, his re-election, which he is convinced depends on reopening the economy without bothering with the testing protocols, contact tracing and other precautions that could make doing so both safe and feasible.
(Even if people are willing to die for a noble cause, it’s worth pausing here and observing gently that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is not such a cause.)
Moreover, Trump has always made a point of presenting himself as the fascist version of the Übermensch, even as he is likely too dim to know that word or what it signifies. Trump is forever bragging about his alleged “good genes,” which he often invokes as being so powerful as to render him a genius-level expert in any number of subjects, from medicine to economics to military strategy, without any need to do anything as weak and effeminate as learning stuff. Wearing a mask would go against his effort to present himself as possessing near-supernatural genetic powers to repel the sorts of viruses with which mere mortals must contend.
Of course, Trump doesn’t actually believe his own lies on this subject (nor on many others). As NBC News has reported, when Trump found out that a White House valet had the coronavirus, he became “lava level mad” at his staff and accused them of not doing enough to protect him. His public bravado is, as with all things Trump, a thin mask plastered over a deep well of insecurity. He may want you to believe his immune system is superhuman, but he knows full well that his obese and shattered 73-year-old physique puts him in the category of the high-risk people he and his fellow Republicans are treating as weaklings better off culled from the herd.
Unfortunately, because face masks have become such a potent symbol to far-right culture warriors of values they reject, such as equality and compassion, we can only expect the symbolic clash over masks to escalate. More and more conservatives, especially men, will try to prove their superior masculine strength and power by refusing to wear them. This is childish, selfish and entirely counterproductive, of course. What else can we expect from Trump and his followers, who are the real weaklings in this unhappy social equation?","['repulsed', 'affront', 'to', 'God’s', 'creation']"
"The man-made Amazon fires are for clearing the land of its forests and indigenous people. The benefits are for Jair Bolsonaro’s cronies, while producing a climate disaster for the world.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/white-nationalism-and-crony-capitalism-are-the-sparks-that-started-fires-in-the-amazon/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,44.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"The man-made Amazon fires are for clearing the land of its forests and indigenous people. The benefits are for Jair Bolsonaro’s cronies, while producing a climate disaster for the world.
The Amazon fires in Brazil have become worldwide news. Explaining the fires recently, Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said that “August 2019 stands out” as a month with a far higher number of fires than any preceding year since 2010.
This is similar to what Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) had reported earlier. The head of INPE, Ricardo Galvao, was fired on August 2 this year after INPE came out with figures based on satellite imagery that showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon had increased by 40 percent in two months over a similar period last year.
That it is largely man-made can be seen from looking at where the fires have started in Brazil: mostly along the major highways and spreading into the forest. Clearly, it is an attempt to clear the forests for economic exploitation—logging, cattle ranching, commercial farming and mining—that lies at the heart of President Bolsonaro’s policies.
Speaking to reporters in the last week of August, Bolsonaro said, “It is too much land for so few Indians.” While he has declared a temporary moratorium on land-clearing due to the fires, the thrust of his policies is still to dismantle all obstacles to handing over the Amazon to big corporate and landed interests in Brazil.
Amazon forests are the world’s biggest store of carbon as well as its largest global sink. If it goes up in smoke, it will produce climate change on a scale not seen before. And this change could soon become irreversible, as once a forest starts dying, after a point, it becomes almost impossible to stop its downward plunge.
Apart from acting to fix atmospheric carbon, Amazon forests also help in the hydrological cycle that produces rainfall. The loss of forest cover in the Amazon would affect not only the world’s climate, but also the local climate in Brazil and neighboring countries, leading to less rainfall, and adversely affecting its agriculture.
While Brazil has taken the lead in a direct attack on the Amazon, with Bolsonaro adding a racial element to his attack on indigenous people, the pressure to open the Amazonian forests to agriculture, logging and mining is not just limited to Brazil. Obviously, why should other countries, which have finished their forests, argue that countries with forests keep them permanently for global benefit? Who pays and who gains is very much a part of the climate change negotiations—the Paris Accord—from which Trump and the United States have walked out.
This pitch—who pays and who gains—could indeed be a nationalist pitch for Brazil. But this is not Bolsonaro’s argument. For him, the only issue is that fires lit for clearing the Amazon should not burn without control: he must be shedding tears about all those logs that could have been sold for money going up in smoke.
He is asking President Trump, a fellow climate change disbeliever and another white nationalist, for help with dousing the fires. He has no sympathy for Brazil’s indigenous people—“Indians,” he calls them—bemoaning the failure of the Brazilian cavalry in “clearing” its indigenous people, unlike the U.S. cavalry, which was so much more efficient in its “extermination of the Indians.”
Before we address the complex issue of climate justice, indigenous rights and economic development, we need to address one misunderstanding on the role of Amazon forests. Amazon forests do not produce 20 percent of the oxygen the world needs, as is commonly said. It is the largest producer of oxygen on land, producing about 6-9 percent of the total oxygen that is produced globally, including from the oceans. Still, we cannot talk of producing oxygen without also asking how much of it the Amazon consumes. So we must see the net oxygen that the Amazon produces, meaning, subtract the oxygen consumed by it from what it produces. Once we do that, we find that the Amazon’s net output of oxygen is near zero, as it is also the largest consumer of oxygen. The Amazon’s value is in fixing atmospheric carbon, and its loss will mean the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere with devastating consequences.
Is it possible to use the forest lands economically such that we do not have deforestation with both local and global consequences? The argument is yes, this can be done using scientific methods and technology, such that we can get short-term developmental benefits as well as meet long-term goals. This would be different from the colonial models promoting mono-cultures and claiming forests on behalf of the Crown, but would mean involving the forest communities in protecting forests. It would mean culling forests, but within limits of its regeneration and using a mix of trees that are natural to the Amazonian environment. It would mean, if mines and other projects are allowed in them, to minimize their impact and leave large areas as untouched natural reserves.
Of course, this would require a policy for indigenous people that respects their identity while allowing them to choose how they integrate themselves; not as living museum pieces, but as communities living in harmony with nature and the rest of Brazilian society. These are complex i ssues and there is no one answer to these questions. Their answer would mean a democracy that allows for dialogue and a way to reconcile the goals of development and maintains peoples’ identities and cultural diversities.
Instead of taking this complex, democratic path, the logic of capital is quite simple. It prioritizes the interest of the capitalists—not capital but capitalists—over other sections of the people. For the capitalist, there is a simple way of looking at any issue: what return can I get if I can get the state to follow a certain policy? Giving away of land, forests and mineral resources to capitalists by the state is what Marx called primary—or primitive—accumulation. In the language of the commons, it is “enclosure” of the commons, and in this case, the Amazon forests are the commons.
If Bolsonaro can hand over forest lands—its trees, its minerals and their use after clearing forests for cattle-ranching or soybean-farming—to his capitalist cronies, they make big bucks. This is the crux of Bolsonaro’s policies. This is similar to what Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing in India with the recent modification to the Forest Rights Act.
Both Brazil and India are expropriating the people’s rights over natural resources on a grand scale. This is what capital and their ideologues call releasing the animal spirits of capital.
Capitalism not only has the Trumps, Modis and Bolsonaros determine that what is good for capital is good for the people, but also other ideologues. One of them, American economist William Nordhaus, has built an economic model that essentially “shows” that it is better to spend money, not on preventing climate change today, but mitigating it in the future. There are two fallacies in this approach. One is that those producing climate change—either directly, through their emissions, or by consuming products that produce carbon emissions—are going to be impacted far less than those who produce much lower carbon emissions.
Unfortunately, the impact of such climate change is going to be far more adverse in tropical and equatorial regions of the world, where the bulk of the poor live. They also produce much less carbon emissions. The other flaw in Nordhaus-type models is that they privilege benefits received today over adverse effects in the future, the same way a capitalist looks at his profits: this quarter’s profits matter more than the long-term sustainability of capitalism itself.
Are other approaches and models possible? Yes, of course. A number of approaches that address both these issues exist. But climate science today has little to do with science; it is politics and the interests of capital that are deciding our climate future. Upton Sinclair, the American writer, had written in the 1930s, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”
Denying global warming is not a scientific mistake that the global right makes; it is simply who is paying the bill that determines their belief.

“Our generation of American Jews are clearly encouraged by the progressive leadership of the members of Congress on this letter, who are modeling what it means to fight tooth and nail against annexation, and for the dignity and security of both Palestinians and Israelis,” Emily Mayer, political director for IfNotNow, said in a statement.
US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (@uscpr) calling on their members to call Congress to get their reps. to support AOC letter on annexation https://t.co/yPUTxcZNlI — Alex Kane (@alexbkane) June 30, 2020
The letter (pdf)—spearheaded by Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Betsy McCollum (D-Wash.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo—declares that if Israel goes forward with its controversial annexation plans, the lawmakers on the letter “will work to ensure non-recognition of annexed territories as well as pursue legislation that conditions the $3.8 billion in U.S. military funding to Israel to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are not supporting annexation in any way.”
“It’s critical that the United States take a clear stand and fully condemn any move by Israel to dangerously and illegally annex occupied Palestinian territory,” Jayapal said in a statement.
The three leading lawmakers are joined in the letter by fellow members of the House Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Raul Grijalva (D-N.M.), André Carson (D-Ind.), Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.), Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), Jesús “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.), Danny Davis (D-Ill.), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also signed onto the letter, saying in a statment that “American taxpayers shouldn’t be supporting policies that undermine our values and interests, in Israel, in Palestine, or anywhere.”

“At a time when Americans are taking to the streets to demand justice and equality before the law, we in Congress have a responsibility to oppose systemic injustice abroad,” said Omar. “Unilateral annexation is a violation of international law, a violation of Palestinian human rights, and directly counter to American values of democracy and self-determination.”
Tlaib charged that Israel is using U.S. funding to further its goal of an ethno-supremacist state.
“The Netanyahu government receives $3.8 billion in U.S. taxpayer-funded military handouts every year and with the backing of the impeached president, they are seeking to use that money to formalize an apartheid system,” said Tlaib. “The implementation of that system would mean our tax dollars—instead of being used to fund healthcare or replace lead water pipes—would be used to perpetuate and entrench human rights violations in Palestine, including limitations on freedom of movement, further expansion of illegal land theft, home demolitions, and cutting off access to critical resources like clean water.”
The letter is, unsurprisingly, opposed by lobbying group AIPAC, which tweeted that the proposal “explicitly threatens the U.S.-Israel relationship in ways that would damage American interests, risk the security of Israel & make a two-state solution less likely.”
To Democrats thinking about signing @AOC‘s courageous letter calling for conditioning military funding to Israel in response to annexation, but feeling unsure because of @AIPAC‘s opposition: Remember that AIPAC & its allies like DMFI dumped $3 million into a primary — and lost. — IfNotNow🔥 (@IfNotNowOrg) June 29, 2020
But 20 groups including IfNotNow, CODEPINK, Jewish Voice for Peace Action, Defense for Children International-Palestine, and the Center for Constitutional Rights expressed their support for the letter.
“As the people rise up across this country in protest of systemic anti-Black racism and demand a fundamental reprioritization of public investment—defunding police and investing in community safety and wellbeing—we must also work to ensure U.S. taxpayer funds are not perpetuating gross violations of human rights abroad,” said Nadia Ben-Youssef, advocacy director for the Center for Constitutional Rights, in a statement.
“We support actions by members of Congress that align U.S. foreign policy with their values of human rights, equality and self-determination, working to hold powerful actors accountable and taking necessary steps towards historic justice for Palestinians,” Ben-Youssef added.
Rebecca Hornstein, a rabbinical student who was one of the organizers behind a letter from alumni of various Jewish institutions supporting the lawmakers, said that with over 400 signatures, the alumni letter “shows that the future leadership of our community is ready to support real action that will hold the Israeli government accountable.”
“The time for empty rhetoric is over,” said Hornstein, “the time for real action is now.”",['ethno-supremacist']
"Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/follow-the-money-gop-senators-are-making-millions-off-trumps-tax-cuts-and-will-repay-him-by-betraying-their-oath/,alternet,middle-class,left,44.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"It’s long been obvious that Republican senators have little interest in serving as impartial jurors in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. While there is a raft of motivations for such historic perfidy — with several GOP senators politically benefiting from some of the same corrupting influences — one under-examined, non-Russian reason is personal greed.
A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. According to a Center for Public Integrity analysis, several Republican members of Congress directly cashed in on the multibillion-dollar windfall from the corporate tax cuts the GOP pushed through on a party-line vote. With the lowest effective tax rate in the last 40 years, America’s largest corporations proceeded to pour $1 trillion not into increased wages for workers but buybacks of their own stocks, causing stock prices to soar. Coincidentally, many Republican lawmakers who voted for the largest tax cut signed into law by Trump personally owned some of the same stocks whose values significantly increased as a result.
At least seven Republican senators owned stocks in companies that spent billions on buybacks, resulting in great personal profit, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The report came on the same day that former New York Rep. Chris Collins, who was the first sitting GOP congressman to support Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading.
It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate. With that, Trump’s fate in a Senate impeachment trial was all but sealed.
While the report is a less than shocking look into the kleptocratic ways of the modern GOP, it shows that the transactional core of the 2017 tax cuts has ramifications far beyond the $1.8 trillion increase in the national debt. Republican senators in purple states, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and David Perdue of Georgia, have personally reaped hundreds of millions from the tax law and are repaying the president by serving as his impeachment propaganda machine rather than impartial jurors — even as half of registered voters and a majority of independents in a Fox News poll released on Sunday said the Senate should convict Trump.
Now, in addition to running defense for Trump, McConnell’s repeating Trump’s empty promises of a middle-class tax cut in an election year.
“We’re talking a fairly substantial … middle-class tax cut that’ll be subject to taking back the House and obviously keeping the Senate and keeping the White House,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. He promised a plan would be revealed in 90 days.
Before the 2018 midterms, Trump actually admitted that his tax bill was never aimed at cutting middle-class taxes, promising to actually deliver in 2019. “We’re putting in a resolution some time in the next week and a half to two weeks [and] we’re giving a middle-income tax reduction of about 10 percent,” Trump told reporters at the time.
The first Republican rule of “middle-class tax cuts” is to speak about them but never actually pass them. They’ve been pulling the same bait-and-switch since at least 1980. But while they were cutting taxes for the rich and corporations, the GOP left in place the income taxes a majority of seniors pay on their Social Security income. Now they are again touting cuts to Medicare and Social Security to cover the payoff they gave to themselves.
“The president directed me to produce what we’re calling tax cuts 2.0,” senior White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow explained last week. “It will be published sometime during the campaign, as a message for future Trump economic growth policies, [with] particular emphasis on the middle class, in his second term. … We are looking at a variety of tax cuts, sometimes making permanent some existing tax cuts, some existing corporate tax cuts.”
That last part gives the game away. The promise of continued corporate tax cuts is how Trump builds his 2020 election war chest from the super-rich and buys the continued allegiance of Republican impeachment jurors, even in the face of ever more damning evidence of his public corruption.

"The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred.

ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['twisted', 'hatred', 'truthers', 'extremists', 'coronavirus']"

And for most of the network’s existence, Hillary Clinton has served as a perennial rogue, depicted as a villainous, criminal scoundrel who can’t be trusted with America’s future. With Clinton now receding from public life, Fox News has seamlessly transferred its vile attacks onto a new generation of Democratic women, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
“Fox News needs an opponent, a detractor, an enemy to add conflict and edge to its broadcasts,” noted the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple. In other words, Fox is in the business of scripted entertainment—under the guise of “news”—and needs long-running characters that it can return to again and again. It crafts targets of hate who rile up viewers and keep them tuned in to the different storylines.
For Fox, Clinton, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez represent perfect targets in terms of riling up its intolerant base: Clinton is a woman of a certain age, while Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are women of a certain heritage. And yes, there’s something in the Fox News DNA over the years that has meant that women political opponents spark a deeper sense of outrage and hate. You could make an argument that during eight years in the White House, it was Michelle Obama who suffered sharper, more personal Fox News attacks than did her husband. It’s all part of an endless, dehumanizing campaign to silence opponents, and specifically to silence and intimidate Democratic women.
This week, Fox News’ sister print outlet, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, published an incitement on the front page, which depicted the World Trade Towers bursting into flames and falsely claimed that Omar, who is Muslim, had belittled the Sept. 11 attack. The reckless pile-on has been relentless. Days earlier, Fox & Friendshost Brian Kilmeade questioned Omar’s loyalty, saying, “You have to wonder if she is an American first.” Over at Fox Business News, Lou Dobbs claimed, “She sounds like she hates America.” Those comments echoed those made by another Fox host, Jeanine Pirro, who suggested, “Omar wears a hijab. … Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?”
Pirro was actually suspended from hosting her Saturday night show for two weeks because of her tawdry attack on Omar. But her suspension has obviously done nothing to curtail the mindless, racist attacks on the Democratic congresswoman. All this has happened while threats against Omar’s life continue to escalate.
To date, Fox News’ obsession with Ocasio-Cortez, for the most part, hasn’t been as overtly dangerous as its smear campaign against Omar, but the negative attention has been unending.","['riling', 'intolerant', 'certain']"

James Mattis eviscerating Donald Trump has landed like a bomb in the Senate Republican caucus, sending members fleeing in all different directions.
While many Senate Republicans are doing their usual duck and dodge move, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made some truly notable remarks about Mattis’ contention that Trump is a threat to the U.S. Constitution.
“When I saw General Mattis’ comments yesterday I felt like perhaps we are getting to a point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally,” Murkowski said, calling Mattis’ words “true, and honest, and necessary and overdue.”
Murkowski said she was “struggling” with whether to support Trump, adding: “I think right now we are all struggling to find ways to express the words that need to be expressed appropriately, questions about who I’m going to vote for, not going to vote for, I think are distracting at the moment.”
Murkowski clearly isn’t done talking yet, noting that she was “working as one individual to form the right words.”
But Murkowski’s acknowledgment that she is virtually alone in her caucus is accurate. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is the only other Senate Republican so far to willingly remark on Mattis’ excoriation of Trump, called the retired Marine four-star general “an American patriot” and his letter “stunning and powerful.”
Practically every other Senate Republican is burying their head in the sand even as they refrain from criticizing a person of Mattis’ stature.
As he left the Senate floor, GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell silently brushed past reporters inquiring about the letter. That’s the second time this week McConnell has gone silent. He also couldn’t bring himself to comment on whether he supported Trump’s threat to use military force on American citizens.
Other members of the GOP caucus also shrank from questions. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa declined to comment. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered, “I didn’t see what he said.” Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, originally suggested Mattis had been duped and misquoted by the press. (Note: Mattis issued a lengthy statement of his own volition.) Told that Mattis actually wrote a letter and asked again whether he agreed with the content of it, Inhofe ducked. “I don’t agree that I should pass judgment on what he should be writing,” he said.
And then there’s the simply next-level stupidity of Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Asked about Mattis’ withering criticism of Trump forcibly clearing peaceful protesters for his bizarro photo op, Johnson offered: “I still haven’t seen any footage of how the crowd was cleared out.” Just a total news blackout over there in Johnson’s bunker. Johnson did, however, say Mattis was “free to express” his opinion. Bold.
Don’t expect any Senate Republicans to declare a meaningful break from Trump anytime soon. As conservative commentator George Will told MSNBC Wednesday, Senate Republicans have “outsourced their consciences.”
But Murkowski’s comments undoubtedly make life more difficult for vulnerable Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado. It’s why McConnell and Ernst, who are both up for reelection, chose to just keep their traps shut. And although nearly every Republican has sold their souls to Trump, none of them want to cross someone with the moral authority of Gen. Mattis, who counseled Americans in no uncertain terms to abandon Trump.
“We can unite without him,” Mattis wrote, an extraordinary comment for a man who spent 40 years deferring to the orders of U.S. presidents.","['eviscerating', 'bomb', 'bold']"

"Apparently, even many people within the gun rights movement are concerned and are working to prevent people from openly bringing weapons to the rally but with leaders like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump rooting them on, the “good people” who will descend on Richmond on January 20 may feel like they have approval to light a spark.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/pro-gun-protesters-actively-yearning-for-a-civil-war-set-their-sights-on-virginia/,alternet,gun-control,left,44.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Lois Beckett has an article in The Guardian on the growing backlash against the prospect of Virginia’s state legislature passing gun violence legislation this year. Apparently, opponents of gun control are surprising people, including their own organizational leaders, with the size and breadth of their activism.
The forcefulness of Virginia’s second-amendment movement has taken even longtime organizers by surprise. Government meetings across the state that typically attract a few dozen people have seen overflowing crowds of hundreds or even thousands showing up to protest against new gun laws… … Still, at least 125 counties, cities and towns across Virginia have passed some version of a second amendment sanctuary resolution since November, according to the Virginia Citizens Defense League. Just this week, the city council in Virginia Beach, the site of a major mass shooting last May, became one of the latest local governments to pass a resolution pledging to support citizens’ gun rights. “I’ve never seen anything like this in the second amendment movement,” echoed Cam Edwards, a Virginia resident and former NRA TV host, and the editor of Bearing Arms, a pro-gun website. The closest political analogy would be the Tea Party, he said, “but this movement is centered around a single issue.”
These sanctuary resolutions are pledges by local governments that they won’t enforce state law. The movement is reportedly being led less by the NRA than by the more radical Virginia Citizens Defense League and its president Philip Van Cleave:
Van Cleave sounded almost breathless in a mid-December interview as he described being overwhelmed with emails, phone calls, and membership requests. He said he expected VCDL’s membership to double over the course of that month, from 8000 to 16,000 members. “I’m telling you, people that have never committed a crime, that are law-abiding, and pay their taxes, do everything right, don’t even have a speeding ticket, are saying, ‘I’m not giving up my guns,’” Van Cleave said.
The group has organized a rally in Richmond for January 20, which is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The event is already attracting out-of-state pro-gun folks, including a potential horde of white nationalists.
White supremacist and anti-government groups are gravitating towards the standoff over gun rights in Virginia because they see it as a opportunity for radicalization and recruitment, said Daryl Johnson, a former lead analyst for domestic terrorism at the Department of Homeland Security.
They’re being mobilized by the usual suspects:
Virginia’s gun rights battle is already being covered widely in conservative media outlets. Donald Trump and the rightwing Arizona congressman Paul Gosar shared articles about it on Twitter. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson talked to a guest on his show about fears that local law enforcement in Virginia would be sent in to confiscate citizens’ guns. Carlson blamed the left for “trying to pick a fight, like a real fight, with rural Virginia”.
The movement is already steeped in bad information and conspiracy theories, and they’ve locked on Michael Bloomberg and his Judaism as a rallying cry.
White supremacist “accelerationists” have seized on the standoff as the potential beginning of a civil war that will destroy the United States and allow them to build a white nation in its ruins, according to Alex Friedfeld, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League. “The story they’re telling is that the Jews and immigrants are responsible for turning Virginia blue, and they’re coming to take your guns,” Friedfeld said. (Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and presidential candidate, is Jewish, and the gun violence prevention advocacy group he founded touted an investment of $2.5 million in Virginia’s 2019 elections to back local lawmakers who support gun control.) To white supremacists, Virginia looks like a perfect example of their ideology: “You’ve got white replacement. You’ve got what they’re calling Jewish gun grabbers, and the people rising up, saying the government is illegitimate.”
The prospect of a possible repeat of the violence we saw in 2017 in Charlottesville has local and state officials concerned.
So far, Ralph Northam, the state’s Democratic governor, has said that plans to pass new gun violence prevention laws will move forward despite the public backlash. “Everyone needs to work to turn the rhetoric down – at the end of the day, this is about keeping people safe,” Alena Yarmosky, a spokesperson for the governor, said.
The January 20 rally in the capital will be a challenge for law enforcement, especially because many of the protestors are actively yearning for a civil war that will destroy the country and allow them to set up a new nation based on white supremacy and anti-Semitism.
Apparently, even many people within the gun rights movement are concerned and are working to prevent people from openly bringing weapons to the rally. But with leaders like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump rooting them on, the “good people” who will descend on Richmond on January 20 may feel like they have approval to light a spark.","['rooting', 'good', 'people']"
It was at this point that Trump thought it’d be a good idea to start bragging.,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-response-the-latest-mass-shootings-came-short?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma,msnbc,gun-control,left,45.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural address included some memorable rhetoric, but it was the new president’s references to violence that stood out. The Republican lamented the crimes “that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”
Trump added, “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”
As the public once again tries to process the death toll from the latest American mass shootings, it’s painfully obvious that the “carnage” did not, in fact, “stop.” Complicating matters, in too many instances, the perpetrators of violence have justified their brutal crimes by echoing political rhetoric they heard from their president.
As a Washington Post piece put it yesterday afternoon, “After yet another mass slaying, the question surrounding the president is no longer whether he will respond as other presidents once did, but whether his words contributed to the carnage.”
It was against this backdrop that Trump briefly spoke to reporters yesterday afternoon, saying, “Hate has no place in our country and we’re going to take care of it.”
Likely aware of the critics who’ve tied his rhetoric to some of the shooters’ motivations, the president added, “This has been going on for years – for years and years – in our country.”
It was at this point that Trump thought it’d be a good idea to start bragging.
“We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it does – it’s not – really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done. “But this is also a mental illness problem. If you look at both of these cases, this is mental illness. These are people – really, people that are very, very seriously mentally ill. So a lot of things are happening.”
As the president spoke about doing “a lot” to address gun violence, while also emphasizing mental health, it was hard not to think of one of the first bills Trump signed into law.
In early 2017, congressional Republicans passed, and the new president signed, a measure to make it easier for the mentally impaired to buy guns. The White House’s budget plans have also proposed significant cuts that, if implemented, would’ve limited access to mental-health services for many Americans.
For that matter, Trump and his party continue to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, which would, among other things, strip many Americans’ access to mental-health services.
What’s more, let’s not accept the premise of the president’s rhetoric at face value. To hear Trump tell it, the perpetrators of mass shootings are sick, so the focus should be on mental health. As important as this element is, it’s an argument predicated on the idea that toxic societal elements aren’t significant, too.
I’m glad Trump believes “hate has no place in our country,” but given the number of dangerous radicals who find solace in his presidency, those seven words aren’t sufficient.
He’s scheduled to deliver additional remarks on the subject in a couple of hours. Watch this space.
Postscript: On Twitter this morning, Trump suggested tying a background-check bill to immigration reform. The connections between the two are tenuous, at best – the gunmen weren’t immigrants – and the chances of Congress packaging the issues are poor.
What was less clear, however, was whether Trump was drawing a conditional connection. Should we interpret this morning’s tweets as him saying he’ll sign a background-check bill only if Congress meets his demands on immigration policy?","['good', 'bragging']"
"More subtly, however, Pelosi is also using her gender to put Trump — who is visibly unnerved by having any woman around that isn’t clearly there to serve him, sexually or otherwise — on his heels. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/how-nancy-pelosi-is-using-trumps-sexism-against-him-and-totally-owning-him/,alternet,gender,left,45.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"From the moment Donald Trump was elected president, the face of the resistance has been female: the Women’s March, the #MeToo movement, the surge of women who ran (and won) as Democratic candidates, the women running Indivisible and other organizing groups around the country.
So it’s fitting that the face of the elected officials who are now empowered to check Trump — the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives — is a woman, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi is a compelling foil for Trump in many ways, bringing experience and intelligence to bear in a battle against a man whose overconfidence is only matched by his inexperience and incuriosity. But her gender adds an interesting dimension to the drama, creating a far different dynamic than would spool out if the Democratic leader were, as most members of Congress still are, a man. Many people in politics and media are still not used to female power, and Pelosi’s novel position, while creating some pointless problems for her, also gives her some surprising advantages.
This was made quite clear in this week’s showdown over the State of the Union address.
No doubt Pelosi’s prowess at Capitol Hill politics was on full display in her choice to deny Trump his chance at delivering the annual speech until he decides to end the shutdown. The move showcased Pelosi’s talent at reading people and figuring out what actually motivates them. Trump will never be moved with appeals to decency, as he has no decency and doesn’t even pretend to care about it. But taking away opportunities for him to preen and brag before a national audience hits him where it hurts.
More subtly, however, Pelosi is also using her gender to put Trump — who is visibly unnerved by having any woman around that isn’t clearly there to serve him, sexually or otherwise — on his heels. Trump is already a terrible politician with no discernible deal-making skills, and he’s clearly rattled by Pelosi in the same way that he was rattled by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential debates. So he’s avoiding direct conflict and hiding in the White House sending out tweets, rather than deal with this woman who unnerves him by merely existing and refusing to be subservient.","['gender', 'visibly', 'unnerved', 'subtly', 'serve', 'sexually']"
"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often compared to Donald Trump, especially when it comes to his anti-Muslim policies.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/india-builds-a-wall-to-hide-its-poor-people-days-before-trumps-visit/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,45.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often compared to Donald Trump, especially when it comes to his anti-Muslim policies. Now Modi has made international headlines for yet another similarity: He’s constructing a massive wall … but unlike Trump’s goal of keeping immigrants out, Modi’s wall was built to hide the country’s poverty from the gold-plated American president. Government officials in one of India’s largest states have built a barrier that’s over 1,000 feet wide and four feet high ahead of Trump’s visit to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, on Feb. 24. Thousands of his Indian supporters are estimated to be in attendance at the “Namaste Trump” event. The Trump visit is expected to cost the city over 800 million Indian rupees, or roughly $11 million USD.
“Since they are spending so much money on this wall, why not use that to improve our slum and provide better facilities for us,” Gujarat resident Keshi Saraniya told the Associated Press. “Why are they hiding us poor people?” While government officials claim the wall was built “for security reasons” and to beautify the area, critics argue the wall was constructed to conceal slums located near the venue hosting Trump’s event. Trump will be visiting the Motera Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, and in order to get there he must pass a slum area that is inhabited by over 2,000 people.
Several political leaders and activists have questioned the timing of the Ahmedabad wall and other development work Modi has been doing in the state (prior to becoming prime minister, Modi was chief minister of Gujarat for 12 years). The wall has faced widespread media attention and criticism for being built days before Trump’s upcoming event, and for leaving thousands homeless. “The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) government doesn’t want the world to see that poverty exists in Gujarat. They want Trump and others to see only the big buildings, roads and that everyone here has toilets and homes,” Mina Jadhav, general secretary of Majdur Adhikar Manch, a trade union in Gujarat, told Al Jazeera. “They (the BJP) want to hide the poor people living in slums, that is why it has sent the eviction notices to these families and built a wall to shield Trump from noticing another slum.”
BJP is a Hindu nationalist party that was formed to make India a “Hindu Rashtra,” or Hindu nation. The party is known to use violence and any other means to advance its agenda of ridding the country of anyone who does not follow what they claim is Hindu ideology or values.
At least 45 families living in slums near the stadium were issued eviction notices Monday. Residents said they were evicted because of the event, but Ahmedabad city officials have denied the allegations, insisting that the land belongs to the city and the evictions were carried out lawfully, the AP reported. “We have been living here for the last 20 years and now we are suddenly being told to vacate because some important leader is visiting this city for a day,” Sanjay Patani said. “This is injustice.”
Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra defended the wall on Twitter, claiming the decision was made prior to Trump’s plan to visit to “prevent encroachments on footpath and road” and that he had “personally visited the slum” to offer affordable housing to the residents. Residents told Al Jazeera that they are unsure what to do. “(T)he government is saying it is helping poor people in constructing new homes but here we are being evicted from a piece of land,” explained Tejabhai Meda, a laborer who lived in the area for over 22 years. “We are not asking the government for homes, we are saying ‘give us a piece of land where we can live.’”
The “Namaste Trump” event follows a controversial but well-attended “Howdy Modi” event held in Houston last September. Over 50,000 Indian Americans were said to have attended the event to welcome Modi to the U.S. The event, promoted by Trump, aimed to marshal Indian American support for his 2020 presidential campaign. “Namaste Trump” furthers this goal by showing Indian Americans that Trump cares about the relationship their home country has with the U.S. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group in the states and an influential voter base. The majority identify as Gujarati, or someone from the Indian state of Gujarat, the same as Modi.
Modi follows in Trump’s footsteps when it comes to disregarding residents while building a wall for unethical reasons. Last month, a portion of Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall fell over, with Mexican authorities quickly responding in order to avoid civilian casualties. In addition, both of the authoritarian administrations continue to pass anti-immigrant policies increasingly against Muslims, including Trump’s travel ban and Modi’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which targets asylum-seeking Muslims and restricts them from gaining citizenship.
The wall is just the latest part of Modi’s larger agenda of targeting poor and minority communities, allegedly in order to improve India’s image abroad. Similar to Trump’s 2016 campaign, Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party promoted itself on the premise of strong economic growth to the masses; however, people around the country are suffering both economically and systematically due to oppressive barriers. As a result of fear and insecurity coupled with poorly implemented policies over the past few years, the country’s growth has significantly slowed down over time. Right now India has the worst economy it’s experienced in 42 years.
Trump boasted last week that Modi promised “millions and millions” of people would honor him on his route to the stadium, Al Jazeera reported. Trump will likely enjoy the devotion he’ll encounter during his trip to India. Unlike his visits to England and states in his home country, the American president is unlikely to encounter discord or protesters in the state of Gujarat because of the state’s devotion to Modi. Those affected by the violence of BJP and opposed to Modi will be far from Trump’s vision, hidden behind a wall. As university protests against CAA and BJP sweep across the nation, Indian youth are the only hope India has to combat a right-wing leader like Modi and anyone else who puts the lives of minorities at risk.",['anti-Muslim']

"Palmer had been using the power of deputization to create a private armed force comprised of his political supporters—and he gave them tremendous powers, including the ability to harass his enemies.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/how-a-constitutionalist-oregon-sheriff-rules-his-rural-county-like-a-personal-fiefdom/,alternet,gun-control,left,45.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"As an Oregon Public Broadcasting report explored this week, Palmer’s continuing rule of the county has become a nightmare for anyone who dares oppose him politically, including a man named Gordon Larson, the former head of the Oregon State Patrol in the region and a fellow Republican—one who says he wants nothing to do with the sheriff’s political extremism.
For standing up to him, Palmer has made Larson pay. Anyone else who lives in the county—even dispatchers from the city of John Day police department—who has crossed him has tasted Palmer’s various forms of revenge.
Palmer came under investigation in 2016 for his role in the Malheur standoff. Due to his long history of involvement with the antigovernment “constitutional sheriff” movement—Palmer was “lawman of the year” in 2012 for Richard Mack’s Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, and made numerous speeches and appearances on CSPOA’s behalf in ensuing years—he was approached by leaders of the Malheur takeover about becoming involved, but he initially declined.
Mack’s organization—which has a long history of association with the Bundys—claims that the U.S. constitution grants sheriffs, and not federal or state officers, powers as the supreme law of the land. These powers include the ability to annul federal and state gun-control and land-use laws.
Despite rebuffing their initial plea, Palmer praised the occupiers as “patriots” in the local press, and met with some of them in a local café. He agreed to help organize a gathering of the Malheur militants, including leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy and others, in the town of John Day (the county seat) on the evening of Jan. 26. It was as those people were en route to that gathering that afternoon that they were arrested by an FBI-led law-enforcement operation, and militant LaVoy Finicum was shot to death while resisting arrest.
Palmer’s role—or lack thereof—in that operation first raised attention to his behavior: The John Day city dispatcher handling Palmer’s radioed request for information about the Malheur arrests hesitated initially, because Palmer was considered “a security leak, not only by local law enforcement including his own staff, but by the Oregon State Police and the FBI.”
“I felt uncomfortable knowing that I had to relay vital and confidential information to someone who may not be trustworthy,” the dispatch manager, Valerie Luttrell, later explained to her supervisor.
In fact, it shortly emerged that Oregon State Police had originally planned to make the arrest in Grant County, but moved the location of the planned traffic stop to Harney County to avoid dealing with Palmer.
Eventually, not only was Palmer cleared by the Department of Justice, he also was handily reelected sheriff, and his brother elected county commissioner. After the investigation opened, however, it emerged that Palmer had been using the power of deputization to create a private armed force comprised of his political supporters—and he gave them tremendous powers, including the ability to harass his enemies.
These “special deputies” were not officially cleared to receive secure law-enforcement information from the dispatch system, which caused a problem for John Day dispatchers. Sean Hart, a reporter for the local Blue Mountain Eagle, searched local records and found that Palmer had hired about 70 such “special deputies.”
Hart reported that public records showed Palmer had deputized seven people as deputies, seven as reserve, five as search and rescue, six as corrections, one as chaplain, nine as special deputies, three as land use deputies, 11 as public lands patrol, nine as public lands deputies, one as limited to concealed handgun license and 11 as a natural resource committee.
Gordon Larson, as OPB recounts, ran afoul of one of these “special deputies” while he was running for the county commission, against Palmer’s brother. Two of these “deputies” filed affidavits against his water rights, and Palmer himself accused Larson of timber theft. He lost by a wide margin.
At one time, the rural folk of Oregon were celebrated for their good common sense and their strong democratic values. In Grant County, at least, the bullies have taken over instead.","['tremendous', 'harass', 'enemies', 'power', 'armed', 'force', 'private']"
"Bear in mind that none of these moneyed elites did anything to earn these extraordinary bonanzas. They didn’t work any harder, didn’t get smarter, didn’t add anything of value to society but simply reclined in luxury and let their money make money. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/here-are-the-dirty-secrets-of-how-the-rich-become-the-uber-rich/,alternet,middle-class,left,45.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"As Ray Charles wailed in a song of true-life blues, “(T)hem that’s got are them that gets/ And I ain’t got nothin’ yet.”
While the workaday majority of Americans continue to be mired in our low-wage economy, the precious few at the tippy top soared out of sight in 2019. They started the year wallowing in wealth — and the more they had, the more they got. As tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, by year’s end, the 500 richest people saw their total haul jump by 25 percent, with $1.2 trillion added to their collective net worth! Indeed, the wealth of the wealthiest is growing so large so fast that a new category of ultra-richness has been coined: “centibillionaires,” those who have amassed more than $100 billion.
Mark Zuckerberg, the ethically challenged jefe of Facebook, is one of them, and he piled up and extra $27 billion in personal wealth last year. Bill Gates of Microsoft added $22 billion to his stash. And even though Amazon czar Jeff Bezos dropped $9 billion last year in a divorce settlement, his fortune multiplied so much that he’s still the world’s richest person.
Bear in mind that none of these moneyed elites did anything to earn these extraordinary bonanzas. They didn’t work any harder, didn’t get smarter, didn’t add anything of value to society. They simply reclined in luxury and let their money make money. That’s a dirty little secret of our rigged economic system: Unfettered inequality begets ever-expanding inequality.
Another dirty little secret is that billionaire-ism and centibillionaire-ism are hereditary. Right-wing media baron Rupert Murdoch, for example, saw his enormous level of riches fall by $10 billion in 2019 but only because he doled out that wad of wealth to his six children. So, voila! Thus were born six brand-spanking-new baby billionaires who did nothing to reach the top of the world’s financial heap except please Daddy.
Not only are the rich different from you and me but they’re also different from the filthy rich. It can take hard work, creativity, perseverance and luck to become a millionaire, but in today’s skewed wealth system, multibillionaires don’t need any of that — their money does all the work to lift them above everyone else.
I’m guessing that being rich is a comfortable feeling — no money worries; you’re set for life!
But is it possible that too rich can be too much, even discombobulating? Imagine being Mark Zuckerberg, who has become richer than Croesus by amalgamating vast troves of nearly everyone’s personal data and then using it piecemeal for global corporations, governments, political groups and who knows who else through his Facebook social media monopoly. Last year, his mass peddling of our privacy put another $27.3 billion in his pocket.
Imagine. On top of already having billions of bucks tucked away, suddenly, in a single year, here comes 27.3 more gushing into your treasury. Forget fundamental questions about whether you (or anyone) are worthy of such an excessive haul of the world’s wealth. How do you spend it? Mansions, yachts, jets, jewels, your personal island and other trinkets barely dent your multibillionous windfall. Funding political front groups and financing corporate-friendly candidates takes a little chunk of your change, as do some charity donations. And since the Trumpeteers slashed taxes for the corporate rich, far less of your extraordinarily good fortune is diverted to public need and America’s common good.
Thus, the bulk of your booty goes to making you even richer! You buy out other corporations and advanced technologies, and you dump billions into Wall Street, intentionally and artificially jacking up the price of stocks you own. Your wealth expands exponentially; inequality spreads further and faster; and the egalitarian ideals that hold our huge, diverse society together are stretched to the breaking point.
Interestingly, more and more of the uber-rich are comprehending the ultimate consequences of such extreme selfishness, so they’re responding with extreme consumerism. Specifically, they’ve created a boom in the sale of maximum-security, James Bond-ish armored vehicles. Priced in the half-million-dollar range, these rolling fortresses can come with 700 horsepower engines, tailpipe-to-grille anti-blast protection, door handles that can electrocute intruders, roof-mounted gun turrets and room for 10 fully equipped bodyguards.
With names like Marauder and Black Shark, these armored beasts have become the preferred rides of gabillionaires — not to flaunt their fortunes but to fend off the masses they’ve ripped off.

"Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with  Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/alexandria-ocaio-cortez-is-absolutely-right-there-shouldnt-be-any-billionaires/,alternet,middle-class,left,45.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to harness the news cycle hasn’t died down one bit now that the newly-elected New York congresswoman has settled into office. Most of the AOC coverage over the past week continues to be TMZ-ified, focusing on Aaron Sorkin’s stuffed-shirt scolding of younger members of Congress and exaggerating Ocasio-Cortez’s supposed conflict with other Democrats.
The congressional freshman from the Bronx continues to calmly and unapologetically use her fame for good, however. She used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.
On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez attended a symposium where author Ta-Nehisi Coates asked her if it was moral to have “a world that allows for billionaires.” Ocasio-Cortez swiftly said it was not. She hastened to note that individual billionaires, such as Bill Gates, may well be good people. But “a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.”
AOC continued to hammer this point home later the same night on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, explaining (yet again) that her proposed 70 percent marginal income tax rate would only be on money made above the first $10 million a year — and that a similar marginal tax rate reached 90% when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
“Do we want to live in a city where billionaires have their own personal Uber helipads,” she asked, “in the same city and same society as people who are working 80-hour weeks and can’t feed their kids?”
Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.
On his own, the barely literate imbecile with no redeeming qualities who sits in the Oval Office claiming to be a billionaire (even if he probably isn’t) creates a one-man argument against the premise that wealth flows from merit. But the numbers increasingly back up Ocasio-Cortez’s argument that our system unjustly concentrating massive amounts of wealth in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of society with little to show for all their hard work and social contributions.
On Monday, Oxfam published a report showing that a mere 26 individual billionaires now have as much wealth between them as the least wealthy half of the human population. Which is to say, these 26 people have more money combined than 3.8 billion of the world’s population.
The idea that those 26 people are somehow being fairly rewarded by that massively unequal equation defies all common sense, especially as most billionaires have built their wealth on the labor of people who only take home a fraction of the value they add to the companies they work for.
It’s not just a matter of sour grapes. The billionaires saw their wealth rise by 12 percent in one year — the same year that saw the poorest half of the population lose 11 percent of their wealth, a loss that people who are already struggling to afford food, shelter and basic necessities simply cannot tolerate.
It’s not just that there seems to be a direct correlation between how much money the rich make and how little everyone else gets. There’s also evidence that vast inequalities stifle economic growth, and that redistribution of the sort that Ocasio-Cortez proposes can kickstart the economy. Money in the hands of working people is spent, and stimulates the economy, much more than money being hoarded by the wealthy few, after all. Inequality also breeds crime and other forms of social instability.
But mostly, this is a moral issue, and one of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarkable gifts as a communicator is her ability to speak about this issue in moral terms. Most people, of all wealth and income levels are hard workers. The fact that only a select few are amply rewarded while most others go wanting is both unfair and immoral. And the worse the problem gets, the more unavoidable this unfairness becomes.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. This includes a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.
The problem conservatives must face is that the very inequality they are defending is a rhetorical obstacle in itself. Most people recognize that it’s unfair that rich people make so much more money than the rest of us, and does not necessarily prove they have worked harder. Getting people to sign off on the idea that they simply are less worthy than their wealthier fellow citizens is not an easy lift, which is why Republicans prefer to stick to culture-war distractions, like fear-mongering over immigration or abortion.
Since Ocasio-Cortez first mentioned the 70 percent tax rate on CNN, a number of mansplaining journalists have written harrumphing pieces explaining that the “real” problem is tax loopholes or capital-gains tax rates set too low. This approach fails to understand the nature and purpose of Ocasio-Cortez’s political rhetoric. Any tax plan that raised marginal rates that high would almost certainly have other provisions to close loopholes or tax investments more fairly. But before we can get to that point, there must be more political momentum to change the tax system.
By focusing on marginal tax rates — which are easier to explain to the general public than most other taxation strategies — Ocasio-Cortez can help build a moral and social argument against economic inequality. Blunt statements, like saying that it’s immoral that billionaires exist at all, can help people reimagine a world where resources are distributed more equitably and ordinary people who work hard and drive economic growth can see their effort reflected in their paychecks.
Because the truth of the matter is that she’s right: We shouldn’t have billionaires. Any system that has a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals, by definition, is not rewarding hard work and social contributions fairly, or anywhere close to it. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that. But the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. Most people know that’s true, whatever their official “politics” may be, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny it.","['Right-wing', 'discredit', 'Twitchy', 'ballbuster', 'implying', 'bimbo', 'genial']"

Yet, I don’t know how well I’d be doing even in better circumstances, because things are so confusing and out of control.
To read David Ignatius, our brave military leaders have finally found their backbone and stood up to President Trump. He wanted to use our armed forces to put down anti-police violence protests and they forced him to back down. That might be true to a certain extent, but then who are the soldiers milling about the capital without insignia or any transparent chain of command? Why is the attorney general seemingly in command?
Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, has had few options this week to hold back the overwhelming show of federal force in her city: the national guardsmen from outside D.C. whom she did not request, the Bureau of Prisons and Border Patrol officers the city rarely works with, the troops in unmarked uniforms who have upset residents. Attorney General William P. Barr has directed all of this, making the nation’s capital the primary stage for President Trump’s vow to “dominate the streets” to quell protests.
It seems to me like the Pentagon has largely extricated itself from this task, but not entirely since the National Guard is still involved. This looks more like covering their own asses than putting any kind of affirmative stop to what Trump and Barr have in mind. It Trump has to relent and allow the 82nd Airborne to demobilize from the DC area, he’s still got his border and prison cops, and his mysterious mercenary army. He may even revive his idea of federalizing the DC police force.
It a good thing that three former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have joined former Defense Secretary James Mattis in condemning Trump’s actions, and it’s encouraging that the current Defense Secretary and Joint Chiefs chairman have publicly revolted. But it’s unclear that this will be sufficient to prevent the president from finding the men he needs to “dominate the streets.”
Perhaps the pushback from the Pentagon will increase the political cost, but if congressional Republicans won’t break with the president, then he’ll probably be able to create the carnage he seeks without too much difficulty.
I don’t think anyone should be doling out backslaps or high fives. The risk is as high as ever, and if the military is going to protect the people, they’re going to have to do more than let it be known that they don’t approve.",['carnage']

In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, American cities are coping with strife and civil unrest comparable to 1968.
In an apparent attempt to divert attention from a lacklustre White House effort to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and a tone-deaf approach to racial injustice, President Donald Trump has entered into another of his many quagmires where he seems to have spoken first and contemplated later.
Despite Trump’s specious symbolic display involving clearing a park of protesters to pose to take photos in front of an empty church, the president’s words at his June 1 news conference were consequential.
He specifically named the Insurrection Act of 1807 as a possible remedy to the current crisis. Surprisingly, due to that obscure act, Trump may indeed have the power to send federal troops into states without a request from the governor, even as the Pentagon tries to distance itself from the threat.
Using military force domestically
In times of disaster, active-duty military troops can be ordered to perform actions to protect life, property and maintain order. In terms of U.S. federal legislation enabling the government to take action to respond to disaster, the Stafford Act authorizes the use of the military for disaster relief. In such cases, a state’s governor must make a request for the military to provide very specific support roles for disaster relief efforts.
However, in the American constitutional republic, there are direct limits on the support roles that the military can play in times of crisis.
Restrictions on the participation of the military in domestic law enforcement are interpreted through the Posse Comitatus Act. It’s been in force since 1878, when it was enacted as part of a backlash against the imposition of federal martial law in the former Confederate States during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era.
There are four statutory exceptions when the military can act in a domestic law enforcement capacity, in direct contradiction to the Posse Comitatus Act.
Three of the exceptions are based on enabling responses to contemporary threats to the United States, when only the federal government would be capable of mustering the resources necessary to respond to serious national security crises of grave concern.
Those situations pertain to fighting drug and transnational organized crime activities, assistance in the case of crimes involving nuclear material and emergency situations involving the use of weapons of mass destruction.
The Insurrection Act
The fourth exception is the Insurrection Act, which has had very little alteration since it was enacted on March 3, 1807.
The act permits the federal deployment of military force into the states to suppress insurrections and enforce federal law in three circumstances. These circumstances are clearly defined by the legislation.
Federal aid to state governments is the first circumstance that allows for federal military intervention to suppress an insurrection in a state, upon the request of that state’s governor or legislature.
During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, for example, President George H.W. Bush deployed federal troops at the request of the California governor to quell civil uprisings in south-central L.A.
Another section of the act, entitled “Use of Militia and Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority” permits the president, on his own initiative, to suppress rebellion or enforce federal laws. If the president believes that …
“Unlawful obstructions, combinations, assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any States by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings …”
… then armed forces of the federal government can be deployed to the states.
The origins for the domestic use of troops are found in the Calling Forth Act of 1792, which allowed for President George Washington to send federal to troops to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion despite disagreements with the governor of Pennsylvania.
The Calling Forth Act was extended into the 1807 Insurrection Act as the militia acts of the 1790s that first delegated sweeping emergency powers to the president expired.
A section of the Insurrection Act entitled “Interference with States and Federal Law” allows for the president to take any measures necessary to suppress, in a state, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy.
The 1957 deployment of federal troops by President Dwight Eisenhower to enforce school desegregation orders in Little Rock, Ark., was an example of the use of that provision.
A divider-in-chief
While Trump has stopped short of invoking the 1807 act to use the military to enforce laws domestically, he’s kept the option open, fomenting further unrest and division.
Rather than staging photo opportunities while awkwardly holding a Bible in Lafayette Square, Trump would have issued a formal proclamation calling on the insurgents to disperse if he’s serious about the application of the Insurrection Act.
Section 334 of the Insurrection Act states:
“Whenever the President considers it necessary to use the militia or the armed forces under this chapter, he shall, by proclamation, immediately order the insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their abodes within a limited time.”
In the event that Trump issues a formal proclamation to disperse, we can then assume that he and his legal team are going down the path of sending federal military forces to the states, with or without the request or permission of governors.
Words we have heard and actions we have witnessed are not those of a commander-in-chief, but a divider who is ill-informed about the appropriate methods and uses of emergency powers available to the executive branch. We dare not believe that the Insurrection Act of 1807 was intended to be a national call to war against the American people.

"A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/of-course-a-woman-can-beat-trump/,alternet,gender,left,46.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Polling for the Democratic nomination tells a depressing story for those seeking to break the glass ceiling and make the ultimate stand against patriarchy: the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are currently all white men. Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg lead in almost every poll; the closest female contenders, Warren and Harris, are stalled in single digits often tied with Beto O’Rourke. Which means that nationally known and highly qualified women Senators are tied with a failed Senate candidate and trailing the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, just a few short years after the party nominated its first female candidate for president and four years after the first Afircan-American president left office.
Part of the problem is that many Democratic women are no longer convinced that a woman can beat Trump, and are supporting white men for reasons of electability:
Across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, three of the first states to hold 2020 nominating contests, dozens of women told The Associated Press that they are worried about whether the country is ready to elect a woman as president. Their concerns are political and personal, rooted as much in fear of repeating Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss to Trump as in their own experiences with sexism and gender discrimination… Helen Holden Slottje, a 52-year-old New Hampshire attorney, noted the irony in women raising concerns about nominating a woman. “I fear for that with women, that it’s, ‘Well, we had our chance. We had Hillary. Hillary didn’t pan out. Best to just pick another 65-year-old plus white guy who has the best chance of winning,’” Slottje said.
This is a tragedy, and it’s simply not true. In most head-to-head polling, Senators Warren and Harris would both easily defeat Trump. There were many reasons that Trump defeated Clinton in 2016, and sexism was surely among them. But sexism wasn’t the sole determining factor. Racism played a big part. There was historic cheating and interference from Russia, Comey and much else. Democrats failed to accurately gauge the more populist mood of much of the country, and their views of the real economy beyond the traditional indicators. And Clinton’s campaign simply made a number of profound strategic mistakes.
But in the narrative that followed the 2016 campaign, much of the media and messaging targeted at Democrats repeated that Clinton had done essentially nothing wrong, that Democrats had run the best possible campaign under the circumstances, and that the blame for what happened in 2016 lay not with errors of judgment by the campaigns and those responsible for messaging and tactics at the highest levels of the party, but with the voters themselves. Much of this defense was erected in order to combat recriminations and complaints from the surging Sanders wing of the party–many of which have admittedly ill-founded.
But as I’ve warned in the past, the insistence that nothing could have been done to persuade many of those who voted for Trump without throwing disadvantaged communities under the bus is not only wrong, but carries a heavy price. If you believe that no amount of economic populism or strategic difference could have made a difference in keeping Trump out of the Oval Office, then the necessary and inevitable conclusion is that the public is simply too racist and sexist to elect a woman or person of color against an explicitly racist candidate like Trump. And then predictably, voters most concerned about driving Trump out of office will wind up supporting a white man for misguided strategic reasons.
And that is tragic. A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office.
Kamala Harris would easily be able to dispatch Trump. So would Elizabeth Warren. The polling already shows that, and much the public still has yet to get to know them better. Harris is still largely an unknown, and most voters who know Warren are most familiar not with her strengths but with her weaknesses. More exposure would help them both.
But if Democrats want to avoid setting up yet another older white man as their nominee, they have to be willing to acknowledge that things could have been done differently in 2016 to avoid defeat. Otherwise, the Democratic base is going to draw regrettable conclusions about the state of the electorate and act accordingly.","['cratering', 'pig-headed', 'patriarchy']"
Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they fear black people.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/how-far-will-republicans-go-to-destroy-democracy/#.XSY6699P5zg.twitter,alternet,gun-control,left,46.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Even before the latest Supreme Court decisions approving hyper-partisan gerrymandering and effectively allowing the addition of a citizenship question to the census, experts have wondered aloud whether Republicans remain committed to democracy. Toward the end of a recent plenary panel on Supreme Court reform at the American Constitution Society’s national convention, University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq suggested, “We don’t really know how committed the Republican Party is to the project of democracy.”
If the GOP still values the rule of law, then perhaps the danger to democracy will recede after President Trump leaves office. But if the GOP no longer cares about democracy, then our political system could be in peril. Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.
Unfortunately, the answer to Huq’s question is clear. The Republican Party is not at all committed to democracy, and GOP leaders and voters would happily tolerate alternative political arrangements. That is a worrisome claim, to be sure, but the evidence is indisputable. Republicans have abandoned any concerns they may have had for the integrity of our political system.
First, as is well understood, the GOP spent the past generation undermining the foundations of democracy — free and fair elections — so as to reinforce white rule. Thanks to the GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box. Due to the Supreme Court’s evisceration of campaign finance law, unlimited and unaccountable dark money floods our politics.
Sophisticated redistricting software enables Republicans to force Democrats to waste millions of votes, leading to highly skewed electoral outcomes. These decades-long assaults required systematically coordinated tactics, such as the 50-year campaign that led to the Supreme Court’s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. The evisceration of democracy is no accident.
Second, the GOP is structurally committed to lying. “Structurally committed” means that party leaders have little if any choice in the matter. They have to lie. And this has nothing to do with Donald Trump. One of the first things that Newt Gingrich’s Republican House majority did upon assuming power in 1995 was to undermine evidence-based policy by killing the Office of Technology Assessment and slashing the funding of the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office.
Why? Republicans must disavow factual evidence because neither wing of the party (the corporate wing or the resentment wing) can tell the truth about what it stands for. The corporate wing cannot admit that it cares exclusively about tax cuts for the rich and corporate deregulation, so it has to lie about what it does. That’s why the 2002 handout to oil, gas and coal companies was called the “Clear Skies Initiative.” That’s why the 2009-2010 health care debate was framed in terms of “death panels,”as if private insurance does not ration care. That’s why the 2017 tax cut for corporations and elites was sold as a middle-class tax cut.
Nor can the resentment wing of the GOP speak honestly about the paranoid basis of its preferences. (Interestingly, Donald Trump occasionally comes close, such as when he refers to Mexicans as “rapists.”) Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they fear black people. “Pro-lifers” cannot admit that they oppose abortion because they are afraid of what would happen if women controlled their bodies. (If they truly supported life, after all, they would fight climate change).
Anti-statists (of the Ruby Ridge or “Oregon standoff” variety) cannot admit that they oppose the public sector because they think government programs are for black people. Xenophobes cannot admit that they oppose immigration because they think brown people are dirty. (How often do you hear them oppose illegal immigration from Canada?) Religious extremists cannot admit that they oppose feminism and LGBTQ people because they are afraid of out-of-control sex. Neither the capitalist nor the resentment wing of the GOP can tell the truth, and that’s why the party is structurally committed to lying. As historian Timothy Snyder has explained, when a political party becomes unmoored from fact, anything is possible.
Third, the GOP has paved the way for the collapse of civilization due to climate change. While it is difficult, psychologically, to confront what’s at stake, some experts have concluded that we have already passed the point at which the collapse of humanity is inevitable, and that civilizational collapse will occur soon. The GOP, of course, has resisted mitigation of the climate crisis for decades. Even the most despicable regimes on earth, such as Syria’s, have signed onto the Paris agreement, but the GOP continues to do everything in its power to obstruct even modest reforms. The collapse of civilization will be worse than genocide, yet the GOP is happy to enable it. If a political party is willing to facilitate an outcome worse than genocide, then why would it oppose authoritarianism? The answer is that it would not.
President Trump, of course, poses an extreme threat to the rule of law. But President Trump is not the root of the problem. Nor is the GOP’s willingness to destroy “democratic norms” the root of the problem. Both Trump and GOP norm-breaking are symptoms, not causes. The root of the Republican radicalism is the triangular relationship among capital (e.g., the Koch brothers), the right-wing media (e.g., Fox News), and resentment voters (whom Hillary Clinton accurately labeled “deplorables”), the latter being the roughly 40 percent of the public who still believe Trump is doing a good job.
Long after Trump leaves the scene, Fox News will continue to manufacture paranoia to motivate resentment voters to vote for capitalists who will head to Washington to lower taxes, deregulate the economy and undermine democracy. The GOP’s capital wing cares about tax cuts and deregulation and, thanks to Fox News, has an unlimited capacity to manufacture paranoia. Its resentment wing cares about making scapegoats suffer, and has an unlimited capacity for consuming paranoia. Neither wing cares about anything else. Not fairness. Not national interest. Not democracy. Not the rule of law. From this perspective, Trump’s presidency is a gift that exposes how the machinery of the GOP works and what’s at stake in its operation.
Many progressives entertain a fantasy that the GOP can be de-radicalized at the ballot box. After all, only 40 percent of the electorate supports Trump. Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett summarized this view before last year’s midterms: “There is only one thing we can do, which is stamp out this form of Republicanism, defeat it completely and govern without them until they learn that there’s a price to be paid for the kind of politics they’ve practiced.”
Unfortunately, however, the GOP cannot be de-radicalized at the ballot box. Democrats already thrashed the GOP in wave elections in 1992, 2006, 2008 and 2018, yet after each election, the Republican Party became even more radical. After its 2012 defeat, the GOP even concluded in a self-administered autopsy that it needed to de-radicalize — and then lined up behind Trump just a few years later.
Even the most mild-mannered Republican, such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, must govern, once in office, as a radical, no matter how sweet their smile or how gentle their manner. They are just as captured by the triangular relationship between capital, right-wing media and resentment as their more explicitly frothy colleagues. Brett Kavanaugh, after all, hails from the genteel, country club wing of the GOP, yet it took no time at all for him to unveil his radicalism, in both style and substance, at his confirmation hearing.","['fear', 'black', 'people']"
"But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-shows-that-christian-white-nationalism-is-a-much-greater-threat-to-the-us-than-radical-islam/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,46.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On March 15, Politico reported that according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the terrorist group ISIS — in its al Naba newsletter — was advising its members to avoid traveling to Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic and offered tips on social distancing and ways to avoid becoming infected (including frequent handwashing). ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['dangerous', 'bitterly', 'white', 'nationalism']"

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — President Donald Trump accused Democrats of “politicizing” the deadly coronavirus during a campaign rally here on Friday, claiming that the outbreak is “their new hoax” as he continued to downplay the risk in the U.S.
“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” Trump said. “They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.”
“This is their new hoax,” Trump continued, adding that attacking the White House’s response to the coronavirus had become the Democratic Party’s “single talking point.”
Trump has weaponized the word “hoax” throughout his presidency, using it to belittle and discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference as well as his impeachment trial. He also has a long history of distrusting experts, most notably his own intelligence community and government scientists.
“Democrats will always say horrible things,"" Trump said. ""Democrats want us to fail so badly.”
Trump — who has been criticized for painting an overly rosy picture of the outbreak, often contradicting his own health officials — insisted on Friday that his administration was “magnificently organized” and “totally prepared"" to address the virus.

Trump faced bipartisan pressure after he requested $2.5 billion in coronavirus response funding, which lawmakers from both parties said wasn't enough. He later said that if Congress wants to grant additional funds, ""I'll take it.""
More than 83,000 people have been sickened by the coronavirus and at least 2,857 have died since the start of January when the virus was first discovered in China. As the virus spread rapidly across Europe and the Middle East this past week, Wall Street suffered its worst week since the financial crisis.

Trump, who ran on a promise to build a southern border wall, used the outbreak as another opportunity to attack Democrats' position on immigration and border security.
“We must understand that border security is also health security,” Trump added, as rallygoers chanted “build the wall.” “The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”
Trump’s rally in South Carolina comes on the eve of the Democratic primary here on Saturday, and it's the latest example of the president’s counterprogramming strategy to hold large events where Democrats are campaigning and voting, competing with them for media attention.",['misleading']

The Democratic candidates missed the opportunity last week in Nevada—a state with a 30 percent Latino population—to address the root causes of our immigration crisis. They predictably criticized the worst Trump administration immigration policies, such as families separated at the border and chronic uncertainty for undocumented people in the U.S., many of whom arrived decades ago as children. How we treat people at or inside our border certainly deserves attention, but we cannot ignore that many people come to the United States in the first place because our foreign policies—by both Democrats and Republicans—force them to leave their homes in Latin America and elsewhere.
The U.S. displaces its neighbors by displacing their governments. The Obama administration supported the 2009 coup d’état against Honduras’ elected President Manuel Zelaya by U.S.-trained generals. The Obama and then the Trump administrations supported repressive and corrupt governments that followed Zelaya’s ouster, giving a green light to assassinations of dissidents and journalists, government-linked drug trafficking, and spiraling crime. This repression continues to drive tens of thousands to seek asylum in the U.S. each year, regardless of the legal obstacles we erect. More recently, the Trump administration supported last November’s military coup d’état in Bolivia—with little opposition from Democrats—deepening that country’s political crisis.
United States aid and trade policies—often touted as helping our neighbors—also drive people from their homes to our borders. NAFTA opened markets for highly efficient and highly subsidized U.S. farmers by lifting tariffs. Less subsidized Mexican farmers could not compete, and overnight lost their livelihood, forcing many to seek replacement livelihoods in the United States. In Haiti, President Bill Clinton admitted—after he left office—to a “devil’s bargain” on rice tariffs that was “good for some of my farmers in Arkansas,” but destroyed rice farming and generated hunger and malnutrition in Haiti.
The failure of the United States to tackle climate change contributes to a global migration crisis. Catastrophic disasters—growing more frequent and severe —displace more than 20 million people each year. This includes Nicaraguans and Hondurans benefitting from Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States since 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, and hundreds of thousands in Central America’s “Dry Corridor,” now facing their sixth year of drought.
The burden of harmful U.S. foreign policies falls disproportionately on women. In African countries struck by droughts, girls are taken out of school to make the longer walk for their family’s water. Repressive governments we support in Brazil, Honduras, and the Philippines keep women “in their place” with regressive laws, and by committing and permitting attacks against women advocates. Women displaced from their homes and headed to our border face a high risk of sexual assault.
Congress recently demonstrated how bipartisan cooperation can achieve more principled and constructive policies. Last spring, both houses of Congress passed a bill by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) invoking the War Powers Resolution to stop U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen that has displaced 3 million people and killed more than 100,000. President Trump vetoed the bill, but Congress’ War Powers authority, neglected for decades, is now out of the toolbox: on February 13, Senate Republicans and Democrats passed a similar measure to constrain the president’s ability to attack Iran.
The Democratic candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday states, two of which, Texas and California, have 26 million Latinos—more than the total population of any other state. Many Latino voters know from personal and family experience how U.S. policies drive people from their homes. They deserve to know, as do all of us, how candidates will address these root causes of our immigration crisis.
Candidates can start to address the root causes by pledging to respect the choices made by voters in other countries—even if we disagree with them—and ensure that our tax dollars will support economic and social development rather than war. They can announce trade policies that help farmers farm on both sides of the border, and workers everywhere earn a living wage. They can vow to reduce hurricanes, floods, and drought by putting more solar panels on our roofs and less carbon into our atmosphere. In short, the candidates can show how the United States will help our neighbors live secure, dignified lives in their own communities. Because that is a foreign policy that will ultimately benefit all of us.

"Ocasio-Cortez used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/alexandria-ocaio-cortez-is-absolutely-right-there-shouldnt-be-any-billionaires/,alternet,middle-class,left,46.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to harness the news cycle hasn’t died down one bit now that the newly-elected New York congresswoman has settled into office. Most of the AOC coverage over the past week continues to be TMZ-ified, focusing on Aaron Sorkin’s stuffed-shirt scolding of younger members of Congress and exaggerating Ocasio-Cortez’s supposed conflict with other Democrats.
The congressional freshman from the Bronx continues to calmly and unapologetically use her fame for good, however. She used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.
On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez attended a symposium where author Ta-Nehisi Coates asked her if it was moral to have “a world that allows for billionaires.” Ocasio-Cortez swiftly said it was not. She hastened to note that individual billionaires, such as Bill Gates, may well be good people. But “a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.”
AOC continued to hammer this point home later the same night on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, explaining (yet again) that her proposed 70 percent marginal income tax rate would only be on money made above the first $10 million a year — and that a similar marginal tax rate reached 90% when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
“Do we want to live in a city where billionaires have their own personal Uber helipads,” she asked, “in the same city and same society as people who are working 80-hour weeks and can’t feed their kids?”
Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.
On his own, the barely literate imbecile with no redeeming qualities who sits in the Oval Office claiming to be a billionaire (even if he probably isn’t) creates a one-man argument against the premise that wealth flows from merit. But the numbers increasingly back up Ocasio-Cortez’s argument that our system unjustly concentrating massive amounts of wealth in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of society with little to show for all their hard work and social contributions.
On Monday, Oxfam published a report showing that a mere 26 individual billionaires now have as much wealth between them as the least wealthy half of the human population. Which is to say, these 26 people have more money combined than 3.8 billion of the world’s population.
The idea that those 26 people are somehow being fairly rewarded by that massively unequal equation defies all common sense, especially as most billionaires have built their wealth on the labor of people who only take home a fraction of the value they add to the companies they work for.
It’s not just a matter of sour grapes. The billionaires saw their wealth rise by 12 percent in one year — the same year that saw the poorest half of the population lose 11 percent of their wealth, a loss that people who are already struggling to afford food, shelter and basic necessities simply cannot tolerate.
It’s not just that there seems to be a direct correlation between how much money the rich make and how little everyone else gets. There’s also evidence that vast inequalities stifle economic growth, and that redistribution of the sort that Ocasio-Cortez proposes can kickstart the economy. Money in the hands of working people is spent, and stimulates the economy, much more than money being hoarded by the wealthy few, after all. Inequality also breeds crime and other forms of social instability.
But mostly, this is a moral issue, and one of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarkable gifts as a communicator is her ability to speak about this issue in moral terms. Most people, of all wealth and income levels are hard workers. The fact that only a select few are amply rewarded while most others go wanting is both unfair and immoral. And the worse the problem gets, the more unavoidable this unfairness becomes.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. This includes a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.
The problem conservatives must face is that the very inequality they are defending is a rhetorical obstacle in itself. Most people recognize that it’s unfair that rich people make so much more money than the rest of us, and does not necessarily prove they have worked harder. Getting people to sign off on the idea that they simply are less worthy than their wealthier fellow citizens is not an easy lift, which is why Republicans prefer to stick to culture-war distractions, like fear-mongering over immigration or abortion.
Since Ocasio-Cortez first mentioned the 70 percent tax rate on CNN, a number of mansplaining journalists have written harrumphing pieces explaining that the “real” problem is tax loopholes or capital-gains tax rates set too low. This approach fails to understand the nature and purpose of Ocasio-Cortez’s political rhetoric. Any tax plan that raised marginal rates that high would almost certainly have other provisions to close loopholes or tax investments more fairly. But before we can get to that point, there must be more political momentum to change the tax system.
By focusing on marginal tax rates — which are easier to explain to the general public than most other taxation strategies — Ocasio-Cortez can help build a moral and social argument against economic inequality. Blunt statements, like saying that it’s immoral that billionaires exist at all, can help people reimagine a world where resources are distributed more equitably and ordinary people who work hard and drive economic growth can see their effort reflected in their paychecks.
Because the truth of the matter is that she’s right: We shouldn’t have billionaires. Any system that has a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals, by definition, is not rewarding hard work and social contributions fairly, or anywhere close to it. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that. But the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. Most people know that’s true, whatever their official “politics” may be, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny it.","['evils', 'wealth']"
The destruction of the middle class is destroying democracies and paving the way for authoritarian rule.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/ronald-reagan-launched-an-attack-on-the-middle-class-we-must-reverse-it-to-save-our-democracy/,alternet,middle-class,left,46.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The destruction of the middle class is destroying democracies and paving the way for authoritarian rule.
In 2016, Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk published a paper in the Journal of Democracy showing how, in the era since Reagan led America out of classical economic policy and into neoliberalism (aka “trickle-down” and “supply-side” economics), many Americans have ceased to value democracy.
“In the United States,” they write, “among all age cohorts, the share of citizens who believe that it would be better to have a ‘strong leader’ who does not have to ‘bother with parliament and elections’ has also risen over time: In 1995, 24 percent of respondents held this view; by 2011, that figure had increased to 32 percent.” By the time the paper came out in 2016, fully 49 percent of Americans thought elites should make decisions, rather than “government.”
And the growing disillusionment with democracy as a way to protect the interests of average voters doesn’t just push them toward solutions hatched by the Heritage Foundation or the Cato Institute; increasingly, Americans would even consider a military junta ruling America, something that would shock the founders.
“In the past three decades,” Foa and Mounk write, “the share of U.S. citizens who think that it would be a ‘good’ or ‘very good’ thing for the ‘army to rule’—a patently undemocratic stance—has steadily risen. In 1995, just one in sixteen respondents agreed with that position; today, one in six agree.”
And it’s not just in the United States; democracies across the world are falling to the power of right-wing strongman leaders. Just in the past few decades we’ve seen this happen in Hungary, Poland, the Philippines, India, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and, most recently, Brazil. Arguably, it has happened here in the United States with the Electoral College’s selection of Donald Trump as president. Meanwhile, hard-right groups seeking such autocracy are rising fast across Europe, particularly in France, Italy, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In a recent article for the Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria notes this trend, along with Foa and Mounk’s research, and tries to analyze its cause.
“Why is this?” Zakaria writes. “The best I can guess is that we are living in times of great change — economic, technological, demographic, cultural — and in this swirl, people feel insecure and anxious.”
But America and the world have been in the midst of “great change” many times before, including during and after two world wars, but this trend toward authoritarianism has been happening uniquely since the 1980s.
That decade saw the adoption of the radical economic and political ideologies of Thatcherism and Reaganism—neoliberalism—which have since swept the world’s democracies. Even the European Union (with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993) has adopted neoliberal “reforms” that benefitted wealthy elites while forcing austerity on its poorer member nations, inflicting massive pain and inciting right-wing movements in Greece, Spain and Italy, among others.
In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher led the way in 1978. She rejected government ownership of parts of the commons like railways, busted unions, and later argued that, “There is no such thing as society… [only] individual men and women, and… families.”
Reagan came to power in 1980 with the help of vast amounts of money from corporations and the morbidly rich, made possible by the twin 1976 and 1978 Supreme Court decisions of Buckley v. Valeo and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, which said that billionaires and corporations owning politicians was “free speech.”
With a nod to his oligarch funders, in his inaugural address, his first day on the job as president, Reagan famously said, “[G]overnment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”
When Reagan flipped our economic system on its head, rejecting two generations of classical Adam Smith economics and replacing it with the Laffer Curve and “supply-side” economics, almost a third of Americans had union jobs and around 60 percent of American families lived in the economic “middle class.” But starting in 2015, as NPR noted, reporting on a Pew study, “middle-income households have become the minority.”
Since David Koch’s failed 1980 run for VP on the Libertarian ticket, American oligarchs have invested billions of dollars in the message that government is bad and can’t be trusted. The most obvious example was the faux-grassroots Tea Party “movement” funded by Koch front groups, causing thousands of Americans to protest “government-run” health care with slogans like, “Keep your goddamn government hands off my Medicare!”
Koch and his oligarch friends suggested, through their surrogates and think tanks, that instead of a functioning democracy we should have a government both owned and run by them and their billionaire buddies.
And that’s largely what we have now, with the Trump administration. As former Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently tweeted, “A corporate lawyer runs DOL, a pharma exec runs HHS, a coal lobbyist runs EPA, an oil lobbyist runs DOI, a Raytheon lobbyist runs DOD, a steel lobbyist is the US trade rep, and a banking exec runs USDT.” I’d add that a former Verizon lawyer runs the FCC, and midlevel positions across the federal government are now filled with lobbyists and lawyers from industry.
Prior to the Reagan Revolution, Americans usually got what they wanted from the government.
The successes of LBJ’s Great Society programs during the 1960s are a great example: Medicare, Medicaid, Voting Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, cutting poverty in half, Head Start, the National Teacher Corps, hundreds of billions in student college aid, PBS and NPR, Air Quality Act, Water Quality Act, Wilderness Act, National Trails System Act, creating the Cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Action Agencies, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Child Safety Act, mandating warning labels on cigarettes, the Immigration Act that ended race-based immigration quotas, food stamps, and massive investments in public schools and hospitals… among other things.
In the 1970s, Jimmy Carter followed up by creating the Department of Energy and passing energy programs that would have moved 20 percent of America’s electricity generation to solar by 2000 (it was ended by Reagan), establishing the Department of Education, massively expanding Head Start, passing major laws to regulate coal mining and make it safer, forcing polluters to clean up superfund sites, and doubling our public lands in Alaska. Not to mention winning the Nobel Prize for working out a peace deal between Egypt and Israel that holds to this day.
Before the 1980s, Western Europe and other democracies saw similar expansions of people-based government programs. But nearly all of it came to a screeching halt—and much was even reversed—with the neoliberal Thatcher and Reagan Revolutions.
Today’s standard-bearers for neoliberalism are the Republicans (and a few corporate-owned Democrats), and, as Americans figure out that the probability today of legislation passing that’s supported by the majority of Americans is today equivalent to random chance, they’re revolting.
And the oligarch billionaires have been waiting for just this moment, funding massive voter suppression, right-wing media, politicians who tell us that up is down, and efforts to keep their colleague, billionaire Donald Trump, in office. While the outreach to “very fine people” in the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements is a bit less visible, it’s there, too.
So long as the governments of America and other countries are captives of oligarchs and big corporations, and hang onto anti-worker, anti-middle-class neoliberal policies, citizens will continue to drift toward hard-right “populist” politicians.
Democracies will only begin to revive when we reverse the Reagan Revolution and return to the classical economic and political systems that existed in the Western world before the neoliberal 1980s.
And if that reversal doesn’t happen soon, the trend toward autocratic oligarchy will continue to speed up. As Foa and Mounk note in the conclusion of their research paper, “[W]hat was once unthinkable should no longer be considered outside the realm of possibility.”

"Consistently, Trump has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/worse-than-a-preschooler-donald-trump-is-failing-the-marshmallow-test/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,47.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Fifty years ago, in a now-classic experiment, Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel and his colleagues presented preschoolers with a plate of treats and a dilemma: They could have one marshmallow now or wait 20 minutes and get two marshmallows later.
The kids who managed to wait (despite a plateful of temptation in front of them) turned out to be generally more successful than their more impatient peers. Their grades were better, their SAT scores were higher, they were healthier and socially better-adjusted. The experiment set off an explosion of scholarship on the benefits of delayed gratification, perseverance, and “grit.” It’s one reason “self-mastery” and “self-control” are part of almost every kindergartener’s curriculum today.
America is now facing something like a national Marshmallow Test. Many states are pushing to reopen their economies, even with plentiful evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As summer beckons and restrictions loosen, citizens will have to judge just how far they’ll reach for a taste of pre-pandemic normalcy, whether it’s a trip to the salon, a carefree cookout with friends, or a night out at the theater. More challenging, people will have to maintain the discipline of social distancing until the virus is genuinely under control. It might be tantalizing to forego some of the summer’s most sought-after activities—like a trip to the beach—but the most abstemious countries will have greater rewards down the line. No doubt, those that persevere in taming the virus will claim the prize of lasting economic stability.
President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. Worse than the preschooler who succumbs to a single marshmallow, Trump would stuff his face and then smash the plate.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. Barely two weeks after declaring a national emergency in mid-March, he said he hoped to see “packed churches” by Easter and started urging the return of professional sports with full stadiums. As cases mounted a month later, Trump tweeted to “liberate” three states from lockdown restrictions, encouraging rebellions against governors’ efforts to stop the spread of infection. Then, in late May, as U.S. deaths edged toward the ominous threshold of 100,000, Trump called on churches to hold in-person services, contradicting state bans on mass gatherings, declaring them “essential.”
Consistently, he has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly hasn’t spoken to Trump in two weeks. All of these comments and actions have delayed the day when true normalcy will arrive, if not sabotaged it altogether.
For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.
Public health officials have repeatedly warned against the lifting of restrictions prematurely, especially when many states still lack the testing and contact tracing infrastructure necessary to tamp down inevitable outbreaks. Adding to these worries is the possibility of a new wave, sparked by this week’s mass protests and the gatherings over Memorial Day weekend. The worst-case scenario, scientists say, is a resurgence of the virus this fall in combination with the seasonal flu. The coming months, as ousted vaccine official Rick Bright recently told Congress, could be the “darkest winter in modern history.” Nevertheless, states are vaulting over the federal government’s metrics for a safe reopening in a race to restart their economies. As of June 3, 16 states were reporting a rise in new infections, a number that’s likely to tick upward.
Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Rather than tackle immigration reform, Trump opted for the cheap optics of “building a wall,” a colossal waste of tax-payer money. Rather than negotiate a sensible agreement with China over its unfair trade practices, he levied a series of ill-considered tariffs and set off a trade war that has put U.S.-China relations on its worst footing in decades. And instead of investing in the painstaking work of tamping down COVID-19, he’s scapegoated the World Health Organization and repeatedly touted an anti-malaria drug that doesn’t treat the disease and is now shown to increase the likelihood of death.
The next few months will pose a crucial test of our national resolve and set the country’s trajectory for years to come. Americans need a leader who is honest about the difficulties that lie ahead, undaunted by the scale of the task, and willing to do take on the arduous job of navigating the nation’s recovery. In other words, they need the exact opposite of Trump.
In his speech announcing the moon shot, President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Rebuilding a post-pandemic America will be one of the hardest tasks the nation has ever had to face. Unlike the moon shot, with its aspiration and glamour, the goal will be the simple restoration of a life with some semblance to what we had before.
Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.","['menacing', 'systematically', 'undermined']"
"The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen, the bloody war that Trump continued, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is farther than ever from success.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/how-secret-israeli-attacks-in-iraq-are-driving-trumps-anti-iran-campaign/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,47.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"President Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, notes former CIA analyst Paul Pillar, is more obsession than strategy, and a not-so-mysterious explosion on the outskirts of Baghdad Monday shows why.
Iraqi political analysts are blaming the attack on Israel, saying it follows two attacks earlier this month on facilities of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. According to an Israeli news report, Israel launched the two attacks with U.S.-made F-35 jets.
Israel has long attacked Iranian-backed forces in Syria, an enemy of the United States. Now Israel has expanded its scope of operations to attack targets in Iraq, whose coalition government is friendly to the United States. The predictable result: the Iraqi government is bailing on Trump’s policy.
The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region. When things go wrong, a strategy can be rethought. An obsession can only ignore the warning signs.
The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen that was supposed to check Iran’s power is now in disarray. The bloody war that Trump continued, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is farther than ever from success.
The U.S.-backed Yemen war is losing allies, even among the Persian Gulf states that fear Iran. First, the United Arab Emirates announced it is now bailing out of the Yemen war effort. Then, separatist Yemeni forces, backed by the UAE, took the southern port city of Aden from the Saudi-backed forces. Saudi Arabia is now fighting another war in Yemen that has nothing to do with Iran. It’s a maximum mess.
In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is whispering in the ear of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.) Last month Germany refused to join a U.S.-led naval mission to the Persian Gulf aimed at deterring Iranian attacks, saying everything should be done to avoid escalation sought by Washington.
When it comes to “maximum pressure,” the international reaction is: “include me out”—except in Israel, and therein lies the danger for the U.S. government and the American people. Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran.
Iran is growing stronger across the region and in Iraq in particular. Since last summer Iran has been delivering of short and medium range ballistic missiles to the PMUs. If fired from southern and western Iraq, these missiles could reach Riyadh and possibly Tel Aviv. They are Iran’s main deterrent to a U.S.-Israeli-Saudi attack and thus a threat to Israeli freedom of action in the region.
“The logic was to have a backup plan if Iran was attacked,” an Iranian official told Reuters. “The number of missiles is not high, just a couple of dozen, but it can be increased if necessary.”
Since January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pressured the Iraqi government to order the dissolution of the Iranian-sponsored Popular Mobilization Units. The PMUs, as they are known, are the Shia militias that led a successful fight to drive ISIS out of western Iraq in 2017. They are Iraqi versions of Hezbollah combining Iranian-trained military forces with political fronts. (The bombings attributed to Israelis all targeted PMU facilities.)
The PMUs are controversial in Iraq. While hailed for their role in fighting ISIS, their subsequent expansion into domestic politics was not. Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the nation’s religious leader, blessed the PMUs’ war on ISIS with a fatwa in 2014 but openly opposed their electoral list in 2018.
Nonetheless, the PMUs’ political alliance, known as Fateh, finished second in Iran’s 2018 parliamentary election and helped select Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. According to Iranian news reports, Pompeo made it clear in a January meeting with Abdul-Mahdi that Washington would not react to Israeli attacks against the PMUs.
As Iraq incorporates the PMUs—and there are more than 40 of them—into its armed forces, Iran is bolstering their independence. During the recent meeting in Tehran, a spokesman for one PMU, the Hezbollah al-Nujaba Movement, said any government in Iraq that stands against Iran will be overthrown in a matter of weeks.
That threat is overstated, but the influence of the PMUs is not. They helped save the country when ISIS erupted in 2014. They wield “significant political and military power,” according to the Jamestown Foundation, a security think tank that is hostile to Iran. Despite Pompeo’s pressure, their dissolution is “quite unlikely.”
Thanks to Trump’s policy, the incentives for Iraq to side with Iran are growing. No Iraqi government can afford to be seen making common cause with Israel. When Israel announced last week it would join a U.S. coalition to protect Persian Gulf maritime traffic, the pro-American government in Iraq spurned the idea. Iraq “rejects any participation of forces of the Zionist entity in any military force to secure passage of ships in the Arabian Gulf,” said Foreign Minister Mohammed Ali al-Hakim.
“Iraq will work to lower tensions in our region through calm negotiations,” al-Hakim said, while “the presence of Western forces in the region would raise tensions.” As a result of Trump’s “maximum pressure,” Iraq had adopted the message of the U.S.-sanctioned Iranian diplomat Javad Zarif: the U.S. campaign against Iran is a menace, and “only regional nations can make regional peace.”
The U.S. alliance with Israel comes with a high political price that Trump appears willing to pay. The secret attacks may enhance Israeli security; they also serve to isolate Washington from its Iraqi allies. The attacks may degrade Iran militarily; they also bolster Iran’s standing politically. They may make Israelis nominally safer. They also make the remaining 5,200-plus U.S. troops in Iraq more vulnerable.
In short, the secret Israeli attacks increase the chances that any U.S.-Iran war will be fought in Iraq, where the U.S. intervention proved to be a disaster 15 years ago. And there’s no reason to think the Israeli attacks won’t continue.

"But in her rush for snarky liberal-bashing, Swoyer misses the real story about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s pricey haircut: the blatant and disparate “female tax” that women in power must pay to achieve and maintain their power.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/the-real-scandal-behind-aocs-haircut/,alternet,gender,left,48.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Hair toss, check my nails.” So begins Lizzo’s blockbuster song “Good as Hell,” which sells a dizzying idea of female empowerment. With its iconic rhythm and feel-good sentiment, “Good as Hell” has had tremendous success resonating with young girls, sorority sisters, and dance club frequenters, to even middle-aged white moms like me. But on Thursday, I heard the song scratch to a halt in the back of my mind upon reading a Washington Times story by Alex Swoyer entitled “EXCLUSIVE: Self-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.”
In her piece, Ms. Swoyer seeks to shine a light on the purported hypocrisy of a congresswoman who declares herself a socialist but spends hundreds of dollars on her hair. But in her rush for snarky liberal-bashing, Swoyer misses the real story about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s pricey haircut: the blatant and disparate “female tax” that women in power must pay to achieve and maintain their power.
Swoyer calculates that, in a Washington, D.C. hair salon, AOC likely spent, with gratuity, more than $300 to get her hair cut and colored. The math looks correct. (I say that as someone who got her hair cut and colored in D.C. Thursday for a similarly outrageous amount of money in a different hair salon.) Swoyer suggests that AOC could have spent a mere $100 for the “same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop” where men’s cuts cost about $20.
And that is where Swoyer misses the real story. AOC, like all powerful women, has to go through a rigorous beauty regimen simply to exist in the public eye. Picture Laura Ingraham, Kellyanne Conway, Andrea Mitchell, Nicole Wallace, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, Dana Bash, Susan Collins, and Jeanine Pirro.
The beauty routine for prominent women who work and live under the eye of a camera can include not just haircuts, but hair color, highlights, lowlights, Keratin treatments, blowouts, braids, manicures, pedicures, facials, eyebrow waxes, eyelash extensions. In some cases, it may include Botox and plastic surgery. Not to mention, women operating in the public eye often maintain one to two sets of makeup (one for home and one for the office) which consists of products like foundation, mascara, lipstick, all the brushes and utensils to apply makeup with, and much more. These costs add up to hundreds, in some cases thousands, of dollars a year.
On top of the enormous financial impact, these beauty regimens require these women to take the time out of their busy schedules to attend to their appearances in a way that men in power are spared. Women in power must pay a significant tax on their limited time to sit for manicures, blowouts, brow waxes, and braids, rather than meeting with constituents, reviewing legislation, conducting investigations, chasing a story, traveling to their districts, reviewing their notes, or spending time with their families.
The story about AOC’s haircut is the story about how women continue to face enormous—and often superficially imposed—obstacles to achieving power and influence. Women in power must be more than mentally prepared for work, knowledgeable of the issues, ready to defend themselves and their work on a moment’s notice, and braced to fend off sexism and harassment.
Twenty-dollar barbershop haircuts, a shower, and a shave simply won’t suffice—nor will a mere hair toss and checking your nails. That’s a very real cost for women in powerful positions. It is not, as Lizzo might say, “good as hell.” And that is the scandal behind haircut-gate.

In the recent past, news consumers would come across headlines that referenced a “GOP lawmaker” who said or did something foolish, leaving readers to wonder which Republican the piece was referring to. More often than not, it was Michele Bachmann, Louie Gohmert, or Paul Broun.
And while some of these more cartoonish members are still on Capitol Hill – Gohmert and Steve King, for example, keep getting re-elected – we’re occasionally reminded about the torch being passed to a new generation of lawmakers who are equally difficult to take seriously.
The Washington Post reported yesterday, for example, on some of the antics on display during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence.
A congressional hearing on gun violence erupted into recriminations on Wednesday after Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) argued for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and called for the removal of two fathers whose children were killed in last year’s mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Gaetz, one of President Trump’s most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill, prompted an outcry from the Parkland fathers when he argued at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that illegal immigration is a greater threat to public safety than gun violence.
The far-right Floridian already had an unfortunate reputation, and yesterday’s display won’t help Gaetz’s poor standing.
But while the congressman and his absurdities mattered, let’s not miss the forest for the trees: there was actually a House hearing yesterday on gun violence.
That may not seem especially notable, but this was the first House hearing on guns this decade. As Rachel noted on last night’s show, there have been all kinds of horrible mass shootings in recent years, including the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, but none of them prompted the House, controlled by Republicans from January 2011 until last month, to convene a single policy discussion on the issue.
We finally know what it takes to get the House to examine gun violence: it’s not a mass shooting; it’s an election.
In this case, yesterday’s hearing wasn’t just a generic discussion. At issue is a piece of legislation, H.R. 8 – unveiled on the anniversary of the Tucson Shooting that nearly claimed the life of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) – which would require background checks on U.S. gun sales.
As of this morning, the bill has 231 co-sponsors, five of whom are Republicans. Since it takes 218 votes to pass a bill in the House, I have a hunch the bill will clear the chamber, Matt Gaetz’s efforts notwithstanding.
Its chances in the Republican-led Senate, however, aren’t as good.","['cartoonish', 'difficult', 'take seriously']"
"It’s the golden age of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",https://www.today.com/popculture/all-women-s-super-bowl-ad-helping-close-stem-gender-t173003,msnbc,gender,left,48.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"It’s the golden age of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. And a new ad that will air during the Super Bowl is proving just that.
To pay homage to women in STEM who are paving the way for future generations, skincare brand Olay is launching a Super Bowl commercial with their #MakeSpaceForWomen campaign.
The ad takes viewers on a thrilling ride through space with an all-female crew. It’s part of a larger campaign to inspire women to be strong, fearless and to believe in themselves — with a little humor sprinkled in. Check it out:
The commercial stars retired NASA astronaut Nicole Stott and actresses Lilly Singh and Busy Philipps who take a journey through space. Actress Taraji P. Henson plays the role of mission controller, and the ride is shared over the air by former TODAY host, Katie Couric.
“Space exploration has a way of truly inspiring us,” Stott told NBC's Know Your Value. “It’s a very uplifting platform.”
Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha
The Super Bowl represents advertising’s biggest night, yet only about 27 percent of past Super Bowl ads have starred women.
The ad opens up with Couric reading off a teleprompter, saying ""Is there enough space in space for women? Who wrote that? Are people really still asking that question?""
Then Stott, Singh, and Phillips are seen in a spaceship with Phillips saying, ""We have the opposite of a problem."" Singh adds, ""There is so much space out here."" Stott then chimes in with, ""I could have told you that.""
And since many industries, including STEM, have yet to reach gender parity, Olay is donating one dollar to Girls Who Code every time users tag @OlaySkin and use the hashtag #MakeSpaceForWomen on Twitter between January 14 through February 3, 2020. Olay hopes this will inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, programmers and space explorers to “Face Anything.”
“We recognize that many industries have yet to reach gender parity, which is why we’re using our Super Bowl ad to feature fearless women who have been trailblazers in their own industries as a way to inspire people everywhere to get involved and support Operation #MakeSpaceForWomen,” said Eric Rose, associate brand director for Olay.
Currently, women make up only about a quarter of workers in STEM careers, and they earn considerably less than men.
And according to a recent study conducted by the independent research firm RTI International, in collaboration with L’Oréal USA and the Heising-Simons Foundation, 91 percent of women who work in STEM believe gender discrimination remains a career obstacle. Furthermore, some 88 percent of respondents shared that gender bias serves as an obstacle to women’s career trajectories, specifically in the postdoctoral stage.
This past October, NASA astronauts completed the first spacewalk by an all-female team, consisting of Jessica Meir and Christina Koch. Since then, two more all-female spacewalks have followed.
With roughly 36 percent of NASA astronauts being women, the all-female spacewalks happening now are purely coincidental, said Stott.
“The thing that really impressed me about the first all-female spacewalk was that it wasn’t contrived in any way,” Stott said. “It truly fell out of the rotation for spacewalk assignments. It’s awesome that we’re now at a point where our mix of astronauts brings two women in space at the same time to perform a required task.”
Stott encourages young girls and women to believe in themselves and have the courage to take control of their dreams. “Pay attention to what you enjoy, and look for role models and other women that are present in these fields to be examples,” she said.","['golden', 'age']"

ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['ignorantly', 'truthers']"

"It would indeed be out of character for the Trump administration to take any firm stand against criminalizing homosexuality, since Trump — despite his campaign promises that he would live and let live — has been one of the most LGBTQ-hostile presidents in modern politics.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/watch-trump-is-completely-baffled-when-asked-about-his-own-policy-to-fight-anti-homosexuality-laws/,alternet,gender,left,48.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced a plan to combat laws criminalizing homosexuality around the world.
The effort, which is to be led by Richard Grenell, President Donald Trump’s Ambassador to Germany and the only openly gay man of any note in the administration, is a genuinely positive step. Some 70 countries prohibit LGBTQ identity or relationships in some form, and there are eight where homosexuality is actively punishable by death. Most of these countries are in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, and at lot of these laws can be traced back to the influence of Western colonial possession of these countries.
But there is one person who seems not to have been informed about all this: Trump. In fact, when asked about the new effort by a reporter on Wednesday, he seemed to have no idea what she was talking about.
Watch below:
REPORTER: Mr President, on your push to decriminalize homosexuality, are you doing that? And why? TRUMP: Say it? REPORTER: Your push to decriminalize homosexuality across the world.

It would indeed be out of character for the Trump administration to take any firm stand against criminalizing homosexuality, since Trump — despite his campaign promises that he would live and let live — has been one of the most LGBTQ-hostile presidents in modern politics.
At home, Trump has rolled back protections for LGBTQ federal contractors, rescinded guidelines for accommodations of transgender students in public schools, reinstated a ban on transgender military service, appointed a steady stream of far-right judges hostile to gay rights, and advised federal courts to exclude sexual orientation from the Civil Rights Act. Nor has the administration shown any inclination to promote LGBTQ rights abroad up until this point — in fact, in 2017, his administration refused to condemn the death penalty for homosexuality at the United Nations, out of fear that it could open the door to criticism of the death penalty in America itself.
So it is fitting that Trump does not appear to be in touch with his administration’s single move to stand with LGBTQ rights.",['LGBTQ-hostile']

GENEVA — The World Health Organization chief warned Monday that “the worst is yet ahead of us” in the coronavirus outbreak, reviving the alarm just as many countries ease restrictive measures aimed at reducing its spread.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus didn’t specify why he believes the outbreak that has infected some 2.5 million people and killed over 166,000 could get worse. He and others, however, have previously pointed to the likely future spread of the illness through Africa, where health systems are far less developed.

Some Asian and European governments have gradually eased or started relaxing “lockdown” measures like quarantines, school and business closures and restrictions on public gatherings, citing a decline in the growth of COVID-19 case counts and deaths.
Tedros and his agency have been on the defensive after President Donald Trump of the United States — the WHO’s biggest single donor — last week ordered a halt to U.S. funding for the agency, alleging that it botched the early response to the outbreak.
Among other things, Trump insisted WHO had failed to adequately share “in a timely and transparent” way information about the outbreak after it erupted in China late last year.
Tedros said: “There is no secret in WHO because keeping things confidential or secret is dangerous. It’s a health issue.”

“This virus is dangerous. It exploits cracks between us when we have differences,” he said.
Tedros said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers have been seconded to work with his agency, suggesting that was a sign of WHO’s transparency.
“Having CDC staff (at WHO) means there is nothing hidden from the U.S. from Day One,” Tedros said. “Our CDC colleagues also know that we give information immediately to anyone.”
In one of his starkest comparisons yet, the U.N. health agency chief also alluded to the so-called Spanish flu more than a century ago, saying the coronavirus has a “very dangerous combination ... like the 1918 flu that killed up to 100 million people.”
Tedros called the illness “Public Enemy No. 1,” and said: “We have been warning from Day One: This is a devil that everybody should fight.”

And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['pathetic', 'BunkerBoy', 'shove', 'kick', 'your', 'ass', 'hecklers', 'tough', 'guy', 'nuh-uh', 'big']"
Iowa farmers are bearing the brunt of the U.S. trade war with China as Donald Trump continues to threaten increased tariffs on Chinese imports.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/05/it-could-break-a-lot-of-people-iowa-farmers-face-the-brunt-of-trumps-ugly-trade-war-with-china/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,49.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Iowa farmers are bearing the brunt of the U.S. trade war with China as Donald Trump continues to threaten increased tariffs on Chinese imports.
According to a report by the Des Moines Register, corn and soybean farmers are “[struggling] to feel optimistic” as the industry faces a series of daunting challenges, including retaliation from China over increased tariffs.
The president on Friday took to Twitter to boast about the “very congenial” talks between the U.S. and China while also claiming “the process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars.”
“Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier & quicker to do,” Trump claimed. “Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped.”
For now, the farmers are only feeling the “physical and mental challenge” as China says it will retaliate against any new U.S. tariffs.
“A lot of us think it can’t get any worse, that it can only go up from here,” northern Iowa farmer Brent Renner told the Register. “But that’s probably not a safe bet.”
Tim Bardole, president-elect of the Iowa Soybean Association board, said the best solution would be an agreement between both countries.
“An agreement that is fair to both countries is really the light at the end of the tunnel that I’m hoping for,” Bardole told the Register.
“A lot of producers are in serious financial pain,” he continued. “How long we can survive and handle it, I don’t know.’
Kirk Leeds, CEO of the Iowa Soybean Association, told the Register that soybean farmers have historically “been the tip of the spear when it comes to Chinese retaliation.
“I’m not sure they can take much more,” Leeds said, noting the tariffs have “undercut any remnants of optimism.”
“That’s what’s most devastating about this,” he explained.
Renner, the northern Iowa farmer, echoed that diminished optimism, telling the Register while he hopes “things turn around pretty quickly,” if the current situation stands “it could break a lot of people.”
“There’s no other way to look at it,” he said. “It’s ugly.”","['brunt', 'bearing', 'threaten']"

The massacre that left at least 22 people dead and two dozen wounded Saturday in a city that hugs the U.S.-Mexico border will be treated as a domestic terrorism case, but many acts of white nationalism-fueled violence are not classified as such, stoking concerns that the government is not doing all it could to address an increasingly dangerous national security threat.
""There's no domestic terrorism law — we just treat it as either a hate crime or some other sort of criminal charge,"" said Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. But white supremacists ""are following an ideology the same way that other violent extremists that the U.S. designates as terrorists follow ideologies.""

Investigators believe the man suspected of gunning down 22 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart Saturday posted an anti-immigrant screed on an anonymous extremist message board, citing the Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque shooter who left 51 dead in March, as an inspiration.
In April, a man suspected of opening fire at a San Diego synagogue, killing one person, also posted a note online that was almost identical to one written by the Christchurch shooter. The note, which was full of anti-Semitic language and lauded white supremacy, named the Christchurch shooter and the man accused of fatally shooting 11 people inside a Pittsburgh synagogue as inspirations for the attack.
And less than a week before Saturday's shooting, a 19-year-old man, suspected of killing three people at a Gilroy, California, food festival before killing himself, left a note on Instagram instructing followers to read a 19th-century white nationalist book.
Those attacks followed six worshipers killed at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012; three people gunned down at Jewish community center in Kansas in 2013; and nine slain at a black church in South Carolina in 2015.
Extremist-related murders spiked 35 percent from 2017 to 2018, ""making them responsible for more deaths than in any year since 1995,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Last year, every one of those extremist-related murders was carried out by a right-wing extremist.
Meanwhile, white supremacist propaganda distribution nearly tripled from 2017 to 2018, according to the ADL, which also documented a rise in racist rallies and demonstrations.
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 2018 was also the fourth straight year of hate group growth, culminating in a 30 percent increase overall, ""roughly coinciding"" with President Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency.
The Justice Department is documenting the same trends. Hate crimes in the country increased by 17 percent from 2016 to 2017, marking the third straight year of a spike in hate crimes, according to an FBI report released last November. More than half of the hate crimes reported in 2017 were motivated by racial or ethnic bias, while anti-Semitic hate crimes jumped by 37 percent.
While the FBI and Justice Department have clearly identified a white nationalist domestic terror problem, they have been slow to identify the crimes as such, which deprives the ensuing investigations of resources and fails to thwart subsequent acts of extremist violence, national security experts say.
""You don’t have that domestic terrorism offense that allows it to be counterterrorism agents and prosecutors who are investigating it,"" said Mary McCord, who led the Justice Department’s national security division under President Barack Obama.
Hate crimes, which white nationalist attacks are often classified as, ""rank fifth out of eight priorities, and investigations tend to focus narrowly on a particular attack or attacker,"" Brennan Center for Justice fellows Michael German and Emmanuel Mauleón wrote in a report released last month.

Sometimes, white supremacist violence is classified as gang crimes, which ranks even lower on the FBI's priority list — in sixth place, the report said.
And when deadly hate crimes are not designated as terrorism, investigations often fall to state and local law enforcement, which ""deprives the federal government of an intelligence base necessary to develop an effective strategy to target far-right violence,"" the report said. These agencies are also ""often ill-equipped or unwilling to properly respond to these crimes.""
However, terrorism investigations ""are the FBI’s number one priority and are well-resourced"" and ""tend to look broadly to determine if an ongoing criminal organization may have supported the attack or be planning new ones,"" German and Mauleón wrote.
""Justice Department policies de-prioritize far-right terrorism as a national security threat, ranking it behind cases it labels 'international' terrorism,"" the report said.
Obama weighed in Monday, writing in a statement that ""the El Paso shooting follows a dangerous trend: troubled individuals who embrace racist ideologies and see themselves obligated to act violently to preserve white supremacy.""
""Like the followers of ISIS and other foreign terrorist organizations, these individuals may act alone, but they've been radicalized by white nationalist websites that proliferate on the internet,"" Obama said. ""That means that both law enforcement agencies and internet platforms need to come up with better strategies to reduce influence of these hate groups.""
In international terrorism cases, the FBI frequently uses sting operations, ensnaring people who were prepared to use violence even if they had no actual access to weapons or bombs.
The Justice Department also prosecutes those who provide support to international terrorists, however small. A former Washington metro transit police officer was sentenced to 15 years in prison last year for providing $245 in gift cards to the Islamic State.
There is no statute outlawing material support to violent white supremacists.
In recent years, white supremacists have been killing Americans in public places with regularity, taking advantage of easy access to military-style weapons to inflict death and terror.
Yet the government response to the white supremacist threat has not come close to the level of resources and effort devoted to keeping the country safe from Jihadi terrorism in the years after 9/11.
Michael McGarrity, the FBI’s counterterrorism chief, told Congress in May that 80 percent of field agents and analysts devoted to terrorism are working on matters of international terrorism, including home-grown Jihadist extremists. And 20 percent are working on domestic terrorism, including white supremacists, he testified.
Even with comparatively minimal resources dedicated to domestic terror cases, the FBI said last month that it has recorded about 90 domestic terrorism arrests, compared with about 100 international terrorism arrests. A majority of the cases involving racial motive were linked to white supremacy, an FBI spokeswoman told The Washington Post.
If the FBI is devoting more energy to international terror than to domestic terror, but arresting nearly the same amount of suspected domestic terrorists as suspected international terrorists ""then we've got a resource problem,"" said Watts, who has served as the executive officer of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and a special agent on the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force.
""We need a change of law on this, but it's going to require a big debate on privacy and free speech,"" said Frank Figliuzzi, a former senior FBI official and NBC News analyst.
Watts noted that ""free speech has boundaries"" when threats of violence are involved.
The way the FBI went about combating ISIS and Al Qaeda was three-fold, Watts said. The strategy was to build awareness about indicators of radicalization and recruitment, counter extremist narratives and encourage community-led intervention.
When it comes to white supremacist terror, the response tends to be the opposite — ""decrease awareness, don’t counter the narrative and telling people 'don’t worry about it,'"" Watts said.
Why? ""Because domestic extremists vote,"" Watts said.
Following the Christchurch shooting, Trump was asked if he thought white nationalism was becoming a worldwide threat. ""I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,"" he answered.
On Monday, during statements in response to the El Paso shooting, and the shooting in Dayton, Ohio, about 13 hours later in which a gunman killed at least nine people and injured at least 27, Trump said: ""In one voice, our country must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy.”
""We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism,"" Trump said.
Investigators are still trying to determine a motive in the Dayton shooting, in which the suspect's sister was among those killed.
On Monday, an FBI statement said the shooting in El Paso ""underscores the continued threat posed by domestic violent extremists and perpetrators of hate crimes.""
""The FBI remains concerned that U.S.-based domestic violent extremists could become inspired by these and previous high-profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence,"" the statement said.
The investigation into the El Paso shooting is being supported by the FBI’s Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes Fusion Cell, the bureau said. The unit was established in April.","['lauded', 'language']"
"Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/worse-than-a-preschooler-donald-trump-is-failing-the-marshmallow-test/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,49.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Fifty years ago, in a now-classic experiment, Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel and his colleagues presented preschoolers with a plate of treats and a dilemma: They could have one marshmallow now or wait 20 minutes and get two marshmallows later.
The kids who managed to wait (despite a plateful of temptation in front of them) turned out to be generally more successful than their more impatient peers. Their grades were better, their SAT scores were higher, they were healthier and socially better-adjusted. The experiment set off an explosion of scholarship on the benefits of delayed gratification, perseverance, and “grit.” It’s one reason “self-mastery” and “self-control” are part of almost every kindergartener’s curriculum today.
America is now facing something like a national Marshmallow Test. Many states are pushing to reopen their economies, even with plentiful evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As summer beckons and restrictions loosen, citizens will have to judge just how far they’ll reach for a taste of pre-pandemic normalcy, whether it’s a trip to the salon, a carefree cookout with friends, or a night out at the theater. More challenging, people will have to maintain the discipline of social distancing until the virus is genuinely under control. It might be tantalizing to forego some of the summer’s most sought-after activities—like a trip to the beach—but the most abstemious countries will have greater rewards down the line. No doubt, those that persevere in taming the virus will claim the prize of lasting economic stability.
President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. Worse than the preschooler who succumbs to a single marshmallow, Trump would stuff his face and then smash the plate.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. Barely two weeks after declaring a national emergency in mid-March, he said he hoped to see “packed churches” by Easter and started urging the return of professional sports with full stadiums. As cases mounted a month later, Trump tweeted to “liberate” three states from lockdown restrictions, encouraging rebellions against governors’ efforts to stop the spread of infection. Then, in late May, as U.S. deaths edged toward the ominous threshold of 100,000, Trump called on churches to hold in-person services, contradicting state bans on mass gatherings, declaring them “essential.”
Consistently, he has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly hasn’t spoken to Trump in two weeks. All of these comments and actions have delayed the day when true normalcy will arrive, if not sabotaged it altogether.
For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.
Public health officials have repeatedly warned against the lifting of restrictions prematurely, especially when many states still lack the testing and contact tracing infrastructure necessary to tamp down inevitable outbreaks. Adding to these worries is the possibility of a new wave, sparked by this week’s mass protests and the gatherings over Memorial Day weekend. The worst-case scenario, scientists say, is a resurgence of the virus this fall in combination with the seasonal flu. The coming months, as ousted vaccine official Rick Bright recently told Congress, could be the “darkest winter in modern history.” Nevertheless, states are vaulting over the federal government’s metrics for a safe reopening in a race to restart their economies. As of June 3, 16 states were reporting a rise in new infections, a number that’s likely to tick upward.
Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Rather than tackle immigration reform, Trump opted for the cheap optics of “building a wall,” a colossal waste of tax-payer money. Rather than negotiate a sensible agreement with China over its unfair trade practices, he levied a series of ill-considered tariffs and set off a trade war that has put U.S.-China relations on its worst footing in decades. And instead of investing in the painstaking work of tamping down COVID-19, he’s scapegoated the World Health Organization and repeatedly touted an anti-malaria drug that doesn’t treat the disease and is now shown to increase the likelihood of death.
The next few months will pose a crucial test of our national resolve and set the country’s trajectory for years to come. Americans need a leader who is honest about the difficulties that lie ahead, undaunted by the scale of the task, and willing to do take on the arduous job of navigating the nation’s recovery. In other words, they need the exact opposite of Trump.
In his speech announcing the moon shot, President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Rebuilding a post-pandemic America will be one of the hardest tasks the nation has ever had to face. Unlike the moon shot, with its aspiration and glamour, the goal will be the simple restoration of a life with some semblance to what we had before.
Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.","['penchant', 'slapdash', 'hurts', 'quick', 'fixes']"

This is why Donald Trump is awake at 2:30 a.m., rage-tweeting. When he sleeps, he dreams, and his dreams are nightmares. He’s a frightened, desperate man. Every day, he turns on his television, and the death count from the COVID-19 virus keeps going up. The economy — the precious economy, the one he’s so proud of for no particular reason — is tanking. His poll numbers are down. His approval ratings are down. He’s losing to Joe Biden in national polls and in every important swing state. Nothing he does is helping.
He has tried everything to beat the virus. First he denied it was a problem. You remember the quotes from February and March: It’s only a few cases. Like magic, it will just go away. Then his people convinced him it wasn’t going away, and he had to do something. So he trotted out a string of corporate execs and golf buddies onto a stage in the Rose Garden and declared a national emergency. Surely that would fix things!
But the virus kept spreading, and people were dying. The NBA canceled its season. So did Major League Baseball and NASCAR. Businesses started closing … General Motors, Ford, big businesses — and then small businesses like restaurants and retail stores and salons and barber shops. Unemployment numbers skyrocketed. Six million. Then another five million. Another six million. And those were just the people out of work who actually applied for unemployment benefits.
The virus kept spreading, and people kept dying. Trump called together a “task force” to confront the problem, and he put his vice president in charge. So Mike Pence started holding briefings in the White House press room with input from experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the one with the shoulder scarves. When all the networks started covering them and the ratings were through the roof, Trump took over the briefings himself.
But things kept getting worse. The virus was everywhere. Hospitals were running out of protective gear like gowns and masks, emergency rooms were overrun, there was a shortage of ventilators. They had to do something, so they printed up a bunch of cards with “guidelines” for something called social distancing that was supposed to last 15 days.
Then Congress got involved and passed some emergency bills. First it was in the billions, then it was in the trillions. Small business loans, hundreds of billions — gone in a matter of days. And still the unemployment numbers went up.
Then they hit the end of the 15 days, and the death count kept going up, so they extended the “guidelines,” and he started pushing a cure his pals were talking about on Fox, some malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine. “What have you got to lose?” he crowed from the podium at the briefings.
Apparently, a lot. People started dying from the hydroxychloroquine, something to do with their hearts. So he stopped pushing the pill, and he pivoted to “opening up” the economy. Away went the “guidelines,” and up popped the tweets: LIBERATE Michigan! LIBERATE Virginia! Let’s get those businesses up and running! He put out new “guidelines” for opening up the economy. Three phases! Real simple! Just get your numbers of new cases down for 14 days, and everything can start getting back to normal!
About half the states announced relaxation of rules, and businesses began to reopen. But the virus kept spreading. Now it was in rural Georgia and Arkansas and Iowa, all those precious red states he could point to that were “doing things right,” that didn’t need to be “bailed out” like “Democrat states.”
The death count kept increasing, and some idiot in the CDC came up with the theory that sunlight and ultraviolet rays could kill the virus. Bleach and other disinfectants definitely killed it (on countertops, that is), so Trump pushed the “light” and the disinfectants “inside” and his whole house of cards fell apart.
They were making fun of him! All those pundits and newspapers and networks he had been having so much fun yelling at during the briefings … they were laughing at him! So he decided he’d show them! He canceled a few briefings, then he showed up for one and walked out after a few minutes. Then he decided he would announce that he was phasing out the “task force.” A day later, he was back in front of the cameras saying he hadn’t realized how “popular” the task force was, so of course he’d keep it going — not because the task force was accomplishing anything, but because it was “popular.”
But behind the scenes, Trump was getting briefings. Terrible briefings. Really awful stuff. His own campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who was reported to have spent his hefty paycheck from the Trump campaign on condos, a luxury boat and a Ferrari, met with him and showed him his internal poll numbers. They were terrible — worse than the public numbers according to some reports. He blew up at Parscale. He was in a rage, screaming at the poor guy at the top of his lungs. All the stuff he’d been doing — all the briefings, all the guidelines, all the trillions in relief money, all the magic cures — and look where it got him! Nowhere!
This week came the private briefings on the economy. They were terrible, according to NBC News. “Some of the projections showed the unemployment rate skyrocketing above 30 percent and the widespread collapse of small businesses, according to multiple people familiar with the briefings.” One projection had more than 50 percent of American small businesses collapsing if the country did not get back to work.
“The projections have infuriated Trump,” one source told NBC. “He lost it.”
He must have “lost it” again on Friday morning when it was announced that unemployment in April hit 14.7 percent. “I think the real number is probably around 23 or 24 percent. It’s devastating,” said Neal Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, on the “Today” show.
Trump got away from the White House for the first time this week, traveling to Arizona (a state where his numbers aren’t where he wants them to be) to visit a factory that makes face masks. Hovering over a worker wearing a mask who was making masks, Trump didn’t wear one. Aides later explained he thought he would look “weak” and “ridiculous” in a face mask.
By Thursday, it was revealed that one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for the virus. This is the person who serves Trump his meals and brings him his Diet Cokes. On Friday, we learned that Katie Miller, an aide to Vice President Pence — who is married to Stephen Miller, Trump’s most nefarious adviser — had tested positive for the virus. Pence was conspicuously unmasked last week during a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, flouting the clinic’s rule that everyone wear masks.
Donald Trump has consistently shown contempt for the coronavirus. Now the virus, which has infected 1.3 million people in this country and killed more than 78,000, has made its way into the White House. Experts were saying on Friday that the virus has probably spread completely through the West Wing. Of course it has. Sources told MSNBC that “no one” in the White House has been observing social distance rules or wearing masks.
Trump’s arrogance and dithering and denial has cost tens of thousands of American lives and will cost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, more. He is the president, and he is supposedly in charge, and nothing he has done has worked. His scattershot plan to “reopen” the economy won’t save him. Blaming China or Barack Obama or Joe Biden or anyone else won’t save him. He is a defeated, desperate man. We still have to vote in the election in November, but he has already lost. The virus beat him.","['Terrible', 'awful', 'hefty']"
"While many women, and the men who love them, are well aware that, spurred on by the Vatican, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and the so-called personhood movement, Republicans are working feverishly to eradicate women’s reproductive rights.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/judge-blocks-trumps-evangelical-assault-on-women-in-13-states/,alternet,gender,left,50.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Trump’s evangelical cabal are behind Republican attacks on women’s reproductive rights.
With myriad national crises consuming the lion’s share of the news cycles since Trump shutdown the government to impress Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter, with valuable assistance from Mitch McConnell, it was easy to miss what should be considered good news for women in 13 states – even if it is only temporary.
While many women, and the men who love them, are well aware that, spurred on by the Vatican , United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( USCCB ) and the so-called personhood movement, Republicans are working feverishly to eradicate women’s reproductive rights.
Since the conservative Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby ruling gave religious corporations the right to withhold contraception coverage from their employees, the Vatican-affiliated religious right has been on a tear to allow every employer to punish women, married or otherwise, who dare to have sexual relations “without consequences.”
Although Trump is not remotely religious, and certainly not a Christian by any measure, his administration has spent no small amount of energy to make a “substantial number of women lose access to birth control coverage” because it is contrary to the 1968 Papal encyclical on life – the so-called Humanae Vitae .
Last Friday during a hearing in California to block Trump’s effort to allow more employers to withhold the “contraception benefit” in health plans on “religious and moral grounds,” U.S. Federal Judge Haywood Gilliam remarked that the goal of the evangelicals’ rule was specifically to withhold contraception from “a substantial number of women.” The case was a continuation of the Hobby Lobby ruling objecting to the “contraception mandate” in health plans.
That vile Hobby Lobby ruling did not prevent all women from taking advantage of the contraception benefit, so Trump’s evangelical rule change attempted to extend the religious right’s control over women’s reproductive rights. It was mere months after Trump’s poorly-attended inauguration that his evangelical cabal eliminated the “contraception benefit” to satisfy the theocratic anti-women’s movement.
Specifically, the rule change allows more employers, including publicly traded companies, to control women’s reproductive health under the guise of “religious liberty.” Private employers were also given authority to withhold contraception coverage on whatever they claim are “moral grounds.”
The rule change was set to go into effect on Monday past, but after deliberation Judge Gilliam issued a preliminary injunction on Sunday to stop the rules from going into effect; but only for the 12 states and the District of Columbia that joined California to protect women’s bodily autonomy.
Judge Gilliam had previously blocked an “interim version” of the evangelicals’ rules, and equally noteworthy that his decision was upheld by a federal appellate court just last month. The latest case was necessary because the Trump evangelicals “finalized” the rules prompting another legal challenge by California, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia to protect women’s right to self-determination regarding reproduction.
The Judge did not block the rules from going into effect for the rest of the nation – likely because the remaining states are enamored with “trampling women’s access to basic reproductive care” and refused to join 13 other states to protect women’s reproductive rights. That was how California Attorney General Xavier Becerra framed what Trump and his religious right control-freaks’ goal is in expanding the Hobby Lobby decision across the workforce – “trample on women.” Mr. Becerra said:
“The law couldn’t be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women’s healthcare decisions. Today’s court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women’s access to basic reproductive care. It’s 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women’s rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.”
It is almost certain that the fight to ensure women’s freedom to make their own reproductive healthcare choices will continue despite the latest ruling. The 2014 Hobby Lobby case was the first time the Supreme Court recognized a for-profit corporation’s absurd claim of religious beliefs, and because that ruling was “limited to closely held corporations,” the anti-women’s choice movement has been frothing at the mouth to eliminate that “limitation;” anything to give greater numbers of employers authority to control women’s reproductive health choices.
It is worth remarking that President Barack Obama went to great lengths to accommodate all manner of anti-women’s organizations’ so-called religious objections to women marking their own reproductive health choices, but it was never enough. The anti-women’s rights movement objects to any woman deciding her own reproductive health and despite the law, they will not rest until all women are put in a place the Vatican and personhood movement insists they belong – in perpetual birth mode.
At least women in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia still have a measure of bodily independence, but with Trump’s religious right judges on the High Court, it is likely that autonomy is in jeopardy.
That is the price women are going to pay because there is an unwritten law in America that citing religion as the reason for the never-ending attacks on women’s rights is tantamount to committing treason. It is high time for Americans, especially those concerned about women’s rights, to cease pretending that America is not lurching towards a theocracy. All of these vile Republican policies attacking women’s rights have only one source – religion.","['spurred', 'so-called', 'working', 'feverishly', 'eradicate']"
"White nationalists also expressed excitement Tuesday about Trump's plan to use an executive order to end ""birthright citizenship,"" the automatic grant of citizen status to anyone born in the United States.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/dark-corners-white-nationalism-talk-trump-n926221,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,50.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has put white nationalists on a roller coaster ride in the closing days before the midterm elections.
Eight days ago, Trump declared himself a ""nationalist"" at a campaign rally in Houston. Then, after 11 worshipers were slaughtered at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday, he condemned ""the scourge of anti-Semitism."" And in a snippet of an interview with ""Axios on HBO"" released Monday, amid a broader push to make his hard-line immigration stance a focal point of the election in a week, he announced a proposal to end ""birthright citizenship"" by executive order.
The dark corners of the white nationalist movement take different views of Trump: Some on the far right are ardent supporters who see him as a fellow traveler, while others believe that the president has failed to live up to his promises on immigration and has been too supportive of Israel and too close to Jewish advisers, including members of his own family.
""Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist,"" Robert Bowers, the man charged in the Pittsburgh massacre wrote in a social media post several days after Trump's Houston speech and a couple of days before the shootings. His other posts included suggestions that Trump was too close to Jewish people.
Trump responded quizzically last week when he was asked whether he was sending a message to white nationalists that he is one of them.
""I never even heard that, I cannot imagine that,"" the president said. ""You mean — I say I'm a nationalist? No, I never heard that theory about being a nationalist, I've heard 'em all. But I'm somebody that loves our country, when I say a nationalist.""
White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah was asked by NBC whether Trump viewed himself as a white nationalist. ""Of course not,"" he responded.
And yet many white nationalists responded with glee at what they saw as a coded acceptance of their views in his Houston speech.
""Aw, shucks. It would be real nice if he said 'I'm a White Nationalist !'"" one poster going by the handle VikingCelt wrote, with a winking emoji, on the white supremacist website Stormfront. ""(I know it won't happen but we can dream, can we?)""
These are the remarks Trump made in Houston: ""You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a 'nationalist.' And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word."" But then he did: ""You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist.""

It sounded as though he understood the connotations of the word.
Kevin M. Kruse, a history professor at Princeton who has studied race and religion in America, said that when Trump calls himself a ""nationalist,"" white nationalists ""hear the 'white' part"" even if it's unsaid.
""It’s always hard to trace intent. I would assume he knows how this resonates,"" Kruse said. ""Whether or not he meant it, it's irresponsible not to understand how it's going to be received.""
White nationalists also expressed excitement Tuesday about Trump's plan to use an executive order to end ""birthright citizenship,"" the automatic grant of citizen status to anyone born in the United States.
""Master race president remains the master of races,"" Andrew Anglin wrote at the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website.
Yet there was also deep skepticism about whether Trump could actually fulfill his promise, because many legal scholars believe that only a constitutional amendment — or at the very least a law — could alter birthright citizenship.
And some white nationalists saw Trump's words the way they were received by many on the political left — as a shameless political play in the final days before voters go to the polls.
A Stormfront forum member wrote, ""Trump: What can I tell those suckers to gain some more support for the midterms? Stephen Miller: tell those gullible goyim you're gonna end birthright citizenship!""
Miller, Trump's chief White House adviser on immigration policy, is Jewish. ""Goyim"" is a Yiddish word for non-Jews and it can be considered derogatory in certain usages.
Trump has insisted that his use of ""nationalist"" is simply a contrast with ""globalists,"" whom he defines as caring more about the rest of the world than about the United States.
But for anti-Semitic groups, the term ""globalist"" is often used as a shorthand for conspiracy theories about a cabal of Jews controlling the world and its major institutions.
That's what Bowers, the man charged in the Pittsburgh shooting, was referring to in his post on the social media site Gab.
In the wake of the murders and the delivery of mail bombs to prominent Trump critics, including George Soros, a Democratic donor and activist who is often the central target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, Trump has sought at times to affirmatively distance himself from bigotry.
""The scourge of anti-Semitism cannot be ignored, cannot be tolerated, and we can't allow it to continue,"" he said at a campaign rally in rural Illinois Saturday night. ""It must be confronted and condemned everywhere it rears its very ugly head.""
That's hardly the kind of talk that will win him the allegiance of people who believe that America should be a nation only for white Christians.
But when some on the hard right are most angry that he hasn't done even more to stop illegal immigration, the birthright citizenship plan has the potential to mobilize voters on behalf of candidates he supports.
It comes amid a broader push to demonstrate that he is taking action on illegal immigration that includes sending 5,200 U.S. troops to the southern border and his announced intent to set up tent cities to house undocumented immigrants if members of the caravan come across the border illegally.
Not all opponents of illegal immigration are white nationalists, but many white nationalists are among the most vocal and vitriolic critics of undocumented immigrants and of what they see as Trump's inability to fully control the southern border.
Whether or not he agrees with their worldview — and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that Trump has ""denounced racism, hatred, and bigotry in all forms"" — he needs them to vote in the midterms.
The question is whether the last week has made that more or less likely.","['expressed', 'excitement', 'White', 'nationalists']"
"Sen. Ernst’s flippancy shows how little she and other Republicans think of the grannies and grandpas, dads and moms, and working men and women who have broken their backs to pay taxes and provide for their families.",https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/593581096/0/alternet_all~Alexandria-OcasioCortez-is-absolutely-right-%e2%80%94-there-shouldn%e2%80%99t-be-any-billionaires/,alternet,middle-class,left,50.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to harness the news cycle hasn’t died down one bit now that the newly-elected New York congresswoman has settled into office. Most of the AOC coverage over the past week continues to be TMZ-ified, focusing on Aaron Sorkin’s stuffed-shirt scolding of younger members of Congress and exaggerating Ocasio-Cortez’s supposed conflict with other Democrats.
The congressional freshman from the Bronx continues to calmly and unapologetically use her fame for good, however. She used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.
On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez attended a symposium where author Ta-Nehisi Coates asked her if it was moral to have “a world that allows for billionaires.” Ocasio-Cortez swiftly said it was not. She hastened to note that individual billionaires, such as Bill Gates, may well be good people. But “a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.”
AOC continued to hammer this point home later the same night on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, explaining (yet again) that her proposed 70 percent marginal income tax rate would only be on money made above the first $10 million a year — and that a similar marginal tax rate reached 90% when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
“Do we want to live in a city where billionaires have their own personal Uber helipads,” she asked, “in the same city and same society as people who are working 80-hour weeks and can’t feed their kids?”
Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.
On his own, the barely literate imbecile with no redeeming qualities who sits in the Oval Office claiming to be a billionaire (even if he probably isn’t) creates a one-man argument against the premise that wealth flows from merit. But the numbers increasingly back up Ocasio-Cortez’s argument that our system unjustly concentrating massive amounts of wealth in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of society with little to show for all their hard work and social contributions.
On Monday, Oxfam published a report showing that a mere 26 individual billionaires now have as much wealth between them as the least wealthy half of the human population. Which is to say, these 26 people have more money combined than 3.8 billion of the world’s population.
The idea that those 26 people are somehow being fairly rewarded by that massively unequal equation defies all common sense, especially as most billionaires have built their wealth on the labor of people who only take home a fraction of the value they add to the companies they work for.
It’s not just a matter of sour grapes. The billionaires saw their wealth rise by 12 percent in one year — the same year that saw the poorest half of the population lose 11 percent of their wealth, a loss that people who are already struggling to afford food, shelter and basic necessities simply cannot tolerate.
It’s not just that there seems to be a direct correlation between how much money the rich make and how little everyone else gets. There’s also evidence that vast inequalities stifle economic growth, and that redistribution of the sort that Ocasio-Cortez proposes can kickstart the economy. Money in the hands of working people is spent, and stimulates the economy, much more than money being hoarded by the wealthy few, after all. Inequality also breeds crime and other forms of social instability.
But mostly, this is a moral issue, and one of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarkable gifts as a communicator is her ability to speak about this issue in moral terms. Most people, of all wealth and income levels are hard workers. The fact that only a select few are amply rewarded while most others go wanting is both unfair and immoral. And the worse the problem gets, the more unavoidable this unfairness becomes.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. This includes a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.
The problem conservatives must face is that the very inequality they are defending is a rhetorical obstacle in itself. Most people recognize that it’s unfair that rich people make so much more money than the rest of us, and does not necessarily prove they have worked harder. Getting people to sign off on the idea that they simply are less worthy than their wealthier fellow citizens is not an easy lift, which is why Republicans prefer to stick to culture-war distractions, like fear-mongering over immigration or abortion.
Since Ocasio-Cortez first mentioned the 70 percent tax rate on CNN, a number of mansplaining journalists have written harrumphing pieces explaining that the “real” problem is tax loopholes or capital-gains tax rates set too low. This approach fails to understand the nature and purpose of Ocasio-Cortez’s political rhetoric. Any tax plan that raised marginal rates that high would almost certainly have other provisions to close loopholes or tax investments more fairly. But before we can get to that point, there must be more political momentum to change the tax system.
By focusing on marginal tax rates — which are easier to explain to the general public than most other taxation strategies — Ocasio-Cortez can help build a moral and social argument against economic inequality. Blunt statements, like saying that it’s immoral that billionaires exist at all, can help people reimagine a world where resources are distributed more equitably and ordinary people who work hard and drive economic growth can see their effort reflected in their paychecks.
Because the truth of the matter is that she’s right: We shouldn’t have billionaires. Any system that has a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals, by definition, is not rewarding hard work and social contributions fairly, or anywhere close to it. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that. But the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. Most people know that’s true, whatever their official “politics” may be, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny it.","['flippancy', 'broken', 'their', 'backs']"
"On Friday, Trump claimed he had reached a landmark last-minute immigration deal with Mexico, which meant he no longer had to impose the tariffs he had been threatening, part of his incoherent southern-border policy.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/06/how-the-media-got-duped-once-again-by-trumps-phony-mexico-tariff-deal/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,50.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump lies about everything. So why do newsrooms still assume he’s telling the truth, especially when he unveils grand initiatives? On Friday, Trump claimed he had reached a landmark last-minute immigration deal with Mexico, which meant he no longer had to impose the tariffs he had been threatening, part of his incoherent southern-border policy. And the press, at least for the first 24 hours, went along with the charade, producing White House-friendly headlines that suggested Trump had staved off an economic crisis. But the deal turned out to be a joke. Question: Why do journalists keep making the same egregious mistake of trusting Trump?
The fact that Trump’s grand Mexico announcement fell apart shouldn’t be a surprise, since the president has shown himself to be a committed liar who will falsify all kinds of information. The challenge then becomes: How does the press treat a president who is a habitual liar, the likes of which we’ve never seen in U.S. presidential politics, one who prevaricates about important policy claims? The answer is to stop giving Trump any benefits of the doubt. Simply assume he’s lying, always.
Trump’s proposed tariffs on America’s largest trading partner, which he warned would hit 25% on goods from Mexico in October, likely would have had a crippling effect on the U.S. economy, especially in the southern border states. So when he called off the threat late last week, the news was often reported as a dramatic win for the White House:
“Trump: U.S., Mexico reach deal to avoid new tariffs” (NPR)
“Trump drops his Mexico tariff threat after reaching immigration enforcement deal” (CNN)
“Trump says U.S. and Mexico reach last-minute deal to avoid tariffs” (CBS)
“The trade war ended before it began, forestalling that economic reckoning,” The New York Times stressed in its initial coverage. The Republican National Committee even circulated a cable news clip touting Trump’s successful negotiations with Mexico:
Yet another great deal reached by @realDonaldTrump! As CNN notes, “the U.S. got almost everything it wanted from Mexico”pic.twitter.com/epOriYXIYW — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) June 9, 2019
But the whole pact never passed the smell test. While Trump has been stomping around on Twitter taking imaginary bows—”This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!”—the public details of the deal remained thin and vague. One of Trump’s supposed grand victories was that Mexico had agreed to send national guard troops to its border with Guatemala to help stem the flow of refugees heading toward the U.S. But Mexico only agreed to send “as many as” 6,000 soldiers, a strangely small number for such a massive enforcement job.
The White House presented a feel-good narrative that a week’s worth of raucous negotiations had raced down to the Friday deadline wire before Trump finally won the key concessions, thereby avoiding a full-scale trade war. But none of it was true. It turns out that the last-minute pact was actually filled with agreements that Mexico had already made, long before Trump started hyping last Friday’s tariff deadline. The folly continued on Saturday, when Trump desperately claimed on Twitter, in all caps, that Mexico had also agreed to buy more agricultural products from “patriotic” American farmers. But Bloomberg quickly reported that Mexican officials said no such agreement existed.
It’s true that over the weekend, the press found out the truth about the bogus deadline-busting agreement and highlighted Trump’s misleading declarations about it. By then, though, the White House had already enjoyed a full day’s worth of feel-good headlines, depicting Trump as a masterful negotiator who got exactly what he wanted. (Also, when the press caught Trump fabricating details of the deal, reporters still wouldn’t call him a liar.)
I realize that the journalistic norm is that when the White House announces a trade deal, news outlets report that America has made a trade deal. But these aren’t normal times, and the press long ago needed to walk away from its beloved norms. (Trump, with a trail behind him of 10,000 lies, has shredded so many norms; why can’t journalists?) Nothing Trump says or claims should ever be accepted as the truth. So why would newsrooms on Friday night, when word of the supposed last-minute agreement broke, just automatically assume it was legitimate?
The media’s Mexico stumble comes just two months after the press embarrassed itself by following the lead of another Trump-appointed liar, Attorney General William Barr, who infamously claimed that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had cleared Trump of any wrongdoing in the Russia investigation. News outlets excitedly ran with GOP-friendly proclamations: “Mueller finds no conspiracy” (The Washington Post); “Mueller finds no Trump-Russia conspiracy” (The New York Times); “Mueller finds no Trump-Russia conspiracy” (Politico); “Mueller finds no Trump collusion, leaves obstruction open” (Associated Press). But of course, journalists had no idea what Mueller found because no journalists had read his 448-page report; they had only read Barr’s four-page press release. Yet after the Times announced that Barr’s claims were a “powerful boost” to Trump, the paper hit Democrats for ”downplaying Mr. Mueller’s findings,”while matter-of-factly detailing “the Mueller report’s findings.”
This type of sleight of hand has been going on for years. Back in December 2016, weeks before he was sworn in, Trump claimed that Sprint was bringing back 5,000 jobs to the U.S. thanks to him, leading to a litany of positive headlines: “Trump Says Sprint Bringing 5,000 Jobs Back to U.S.” (The Wall Street Journal); “Trump says Sprint is bringing 5,000 jobs back to US” (New York Post); “Trump says Sprint to bring 5,000 jobs back to U.S.” (Reuters). But none of it was true. Those Sprint jobs were part of a previously announced, pre-election jobs initiative on the part of the telecommunications giant.
Sound familiar?
Having a pathological liar occupy the Oval Office presents a world of new challenges for the press. The first lesson that should have been learned by now is never to believe Trump. Ever.

In 2016, Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk published a paper in the Journal of Democracy showing how, in the era since Reagan led America out of classical economic policy and into neoliberalism (aka “trickle-down” and “supply-side” economics), many Americans have ceased to value democracy.
“In the United States,” they write, “among all age cohorts, the share of citizens who believe that it would be better to have a ‘strong leader’ who does not have to ‘bother with parliament and elections’ has also risen over time: In 1995, 24 percent of respondents held this view; by 2011, that figure had increased to 32 percent.” By the time the paper came out in 2016, fully 49 percent of Americans thought elites should make decisions, rather than “government.”
And the growing disillusionment with democracy as a way to protect the interests of average voters doesn’t just push them toward solutions hatched by the Heritage Foundation or the Cato Institute; increasingly, Americans would even consider a military junta ruling America, something that would shock the founders.
“In the past three decades,” Foa and Mounk write, “the share of U.S. citizens who think that it would be a ‘good’ or ‘very good’ thing for the ‘army to rule’—a patently undemocratic stance—has steadily risen. In 1995, just one in sixteen respondents agreed with that position; today, one in six agree.”
And it’s not just in the United States; democracies across the world are falling to the power of right-wing strongman leaders. Just in the past few decades we’ve seen this happen in Hungary, Poland, the Philippines, India, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and, most recently, Brazil. Arguably, it has happened here in the United States with the Electoral College’s selection of Donald Trump as president. Meanwhile, hard-right groups seeking such autocracy are rising fast across Europe, particularly in France, Italy, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In a recent article for the Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria notes this trend, along with Foa and Mounk’s research, and tries to analyze its cause.
“Why is this?” Zakaria writes. “The best I can guess is that we are living in times of great change — economic, technological, demographic, cultural — and in this swirl, people feel insecure and anxious.”
But America and the world have been in the midst of “great change” many times before, including during and after two world wars, but this trend toward authoritarianism has been happening uniquely since the 1980s.
That decade saw the adoption of the radical economic and political ideologies of Thatcherism and Reaganism—neoliberalism—which have since swept the world’s democracies. Even the European Union (with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993) has adopted neoliberal “reforms” that benefitted wealthy elites while forcing austerity on its poorer member nations, inflicting massive pain and inciting right-wing movements in Greece, Spain and Italy, among others.
In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher led the way in 1978. She rejected government ownership of parts of the commons like railways, busted unions, and later argued that, “There is no such thing as society… [only] individual men and women, and… families.”
Reagan came to power in 1980 with the help of vast amounts of money from corporations and the morbidly rich, made possible by the twin 1976 and 1978 Supreme Court decisions of Buckley v. Valeo and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, which said that billionaires and corporations owning politicians was “free speech.”
With a nod to his oligarch funders, in his inaugural address, his first day on the job as president, Reagan famously said, “[G]overnment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”
When Reagan flipped our economic system on its head, rejecting two generations of classical Adam Smith economics and replacing it with the Laffer Curve and “supply-side” economics, almost a third of Americans had union jobs and around 60 percent of American families lived in the economic “middle class.” But starting in 2015, as NPR noted, reporting on a Pew study, “middle-income households have become the minority.”
Since David Koch’s failed 1980 run for VP on the Libertarian ticket, American oligarchs have invested billions of dollars in the message that government is bad and can’t be trusted. The most obvious example was the faux-grassroots Tea Party “movement” funded by Koch front groups, causing thousands of Americans to protest “government-run” health care with slogans like, “Keep your goddamn government hands off my Medicare!”
Koch and his oligarch friends suggested, through their surrogates and think tanks, that instead of a functioning democracy we should have a government both owned and run by them and their billionaire buddies.
And that’s largely what we have now, with the Trump administration. As former Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently tweeted, “A corporate lawyer runs DOL, a pharma exec runs HHS, a coal lobbyist runs EPA, an oil lobbyist runs DOI, a Raytheon lobbyist runs DOD, a steel lobbyist is the US trade rep, and a banking exec runs USDT.” I’d add that a former Verizon lawyer runs the FCC, and midlevel positions across the federal government are now filled with lobbyists and lawyers from industry.
Prior to the Reagan Revolution, Americans usually got what they wanted from the government.
The successes of LBJ’s Great Society programs during the 1960s are a great example: Medicare, Medicaid, Voting Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, cutting poverty in half, Head Start, the National Teacher Corps, hundreds of billions in student college aid, PBS and NPR, Air Quality Act, Water Quality Act, Wilderness Act, National Trails System Act, creating the Cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Action Agencies, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Child Safety Act, mandating warning labels on cigarettes, the Immigration Act that ended race-based immigration quotas, food stamps, and massive investments in public schools and hospitals… among other things.
In the 1970s, Jimmy Carter followed up by creating the Department of Energy and passing energy programs that would have moved 20 percent of America’s electricity generation to solar by 2000 (it was ended by Reagan), establishing the Department of Education, massively expanding Head Start, passing major laws to regulate coal mining and make it safer, forcing polluters to clean up superfund sites, and doubling our public lands in Alaska. Not to mention winning the Nobel Prize for working out a peace deal between Egypt and Israel that holds to this day.
Before the 1980s, Western Europe and other democracies saw similar expansions of people-based government programs. But nearly all of it came to a screeching halt—and much was even reversed—with the neoliberal Thatcher and Reagan Revolutions.
Today’s standard-bearers for neoliberalism are the Republicans (and a few corporate-owned Democrats), and, as Americans figure out that the probability today of legislation passing that’s supported by the majority of Americans is today equivalent to random chance, they’re revolting.
And the oligarch billionaires have been waiting for just this moment, funding massive voter suppression, right-wing media, politicians who tell us that up is down, and efforts to keep their colleague, billionaire Donald Trump, in office. While the outreach to “very fine people” in the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements is a bit less visible, it’s there, too.
So long as the governments of America and other countries are captives of oligarchs and big corporations, and hang onto anti-worker, anti-middle-class neoliberal policies, citizens will continue to drift toward hard-right “populist” politicians.
Democracies will only begin to revive when we reverse the Reagan Revolution and return to the classical economic and political systems that existed in the Western world before the neoliberal 1980s.
And if that reversal doesn’t happen soon, the trend toward autocratic oligarchy will continue to speed up. As Foa and Mounk note in the conclusion of their research paper, “[W]hat was once unthinkable should no longer be considered outside the realm of possibility.”

Power is pretty much all the racist right wants.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/what-the-left-wing-can-learn-from-the-tea-party-about-how-to-gain-power/,alternet,gun-control,left,50.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Since the Domestic Policy Council was established in 1985 by Ronald Reagan, there have probably only been two heads of the organization that you’re familiar with: Bruce Reed under President Clinton and Melody Barnes under President Obama. If you’re a real political animal, you might remember Margaret Spellings who served in George W. Bush’s first term or know the present occupant, Joe Rogan, who is leaving the position on May 24.
Along with the Economic Policy Council, the DPC is part of the Office of White House Policy. It’s distinct from the Office of Legislative Affairs, which is responsible for advancing a president’s agenda in Congress. The DPC is more of a big-picture organization and it often operates much like a standard cabinet meeting. The leader of the group has a lot of sway over the White House, although how much depends on the president. Bruce Reed, for example, was a founding member of the Democratic Leadership Council and one of the primary authors of Clinton’s controversial welfare reform as well as the administration’s numerous statutory and administrative crackdowns on the gun industry. Melody Barnes was a civil rights attorney and counsel to Senator Ted Kennedy on the Judiciary Committee. She helped push through the Affordable Care Act.
As POLITICO reports, there has just been a major fight among Republican activists and White House staff over who will replace the outgoing Joe Rogan. Initially, it was decided that White House staff secretary Derek Lyons would get the position. Members of the administration began talking about the choice on background with reporters. But then there was a revolt from conservatives who objected to Mr. Lyons because of his connections to Jeb Bush. In particular, the MAGA crowd is hostile to Jeb’s pro-immigrant rhetoric during the 2016 campaign.
His affiliation with [Jared] Kushner also raised some eyebrows, given that Trump’s son-in-law has pushed for some more moderate policies, including business-friendly immigration changes that hardliners say are too lenient. “This is not what #AmericaFirst voters signed up for,” tweeted conservative commentator Michelle Malkin May 6 using the hashtag #JaredKushnerIsNotMyPresident. Malkin described Lyons as someone who comes from Jeb Bush’s “Illegal Immigration Is An Act of Love” wing of the GOP. “Trump has picked Derek Lyons as the head of the Domestic Policy Council…- he’s a former Jeb! Person,” tweeted Ryan Girdusky, a conservative writer and political consultant.
This gave Trump hardliners in the White House the juice they needed to overturn the decision. Instead of Derek Lyons, it will be Brooke Rollins filling the position. She’s the former president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, “a think tank based in Austin partly funded by the Koch Brothers.” There are a couple of ironies here. First, she’s also affiliated with Jared Kushner, as she presently heads his Office of American Innovation. Second, the Koch Brothers are not exactly well-aligned with Trump, and nowhere are they in less agreement than on immigration policy.
But, whether this switch constitutes a true win for the racist right or not, it’s clear that MAGA conservatives are highly attuned to how decisions are made in the White House and which positions they want to control.
Contrast this with the progressive left. When it was recently announced that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be co-chairing a climate panel for Joe Biden’s policy shop with John Kerry, there was an uproar on social media. How could she sell-out her principles and work with establishment Democrats?
Ocasio-Cortez, Kerry and Biden might not seem like a natural fit, but the group came together because they all recognize that they need each other. When AOC, perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most high-profile congressional endorser, moved to embrace Biden as the inevitable nominee, she earned some good will. John Kerry praised and defended her during his April climate testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee for offering “more leadership in one day or one week than President Trump has in his lifetime.”
You might think that supporters of Bernie Sanders would be gratified to see Ocasio-Cortez placed in a position to help craft Biden’s climate policies, but the loudest voices were all extremely cynical about the move and critical of AOC for accepting it.
Ironically, back in March, Ocasio-Cortez was on television defending the Green New Deal and said, “This is not a Tea Party of the left, this is a return to representative democracy.” But many of her erstwhile supporters abandoned her when she gained a seat at the table. She might not act like the Tea Party, but many wish she would.
The progressive left too often does not want power. Power is pretty much all the racist right wants. Both groups are known for making unrealistic demands, but the Tea Party strategists actually understand the leverage points and will fight to get their people into positions of influence. At least in that limited respect, the Tea Party is a more effective anti-establishment organization.",['racist']
"At the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, Trump argued that a regime of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-says-american-worker-top-priority-economists-are-skeptical-n1119386?cid=public-rss_20200121,msnbc,middle-class,left,51.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
President Donald Trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in Davos on Tuesday to make the case that ordinary Americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration’s “America first” maxim.
At the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, Trump argued that a regime of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class.
“Every decision we make on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday Americans,” Trump said, adding that “the well-being of the American worker” was paramount.
On CNBC, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow echoed the president’s assertions. “Inequality is diminishing right now,” he said. “I think we’re in a better place.”
Many mainstream economists hold a different opinion. While low unemployment and steadily — if slowly — rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower-income Americans, these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few.
“The economic backdrop is such that people’s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement… “It’s debatable what all of that’s attributable to,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

In spite of higher incomes, significant wealth-building among the middle class has not manifested, McBride pointed out. “More people are working, more people are making money. The extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security, such as boosting emergency savings, retirement savings or paying down debt, is still unclear,” he said.
The Republicans’ corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
“The Tax Policy Center says that two-thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution, with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains,” he said.
“I don’t particularly feel that it’s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape,” said Scott Cole, founder and president of Cole Financial Planning and Wealth Management.
Economists point out that Trump’s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit, a growth-sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing, even as the stock market has notched record highs.
“There’s no way that what’s happening right now under a Republican administration is fiscal conservatism,” Cole said.
In his Davos speech, Trump revisited another favorite topic, negative interest rates. “They get paid to borrow money, something I could get used to very quickly. Love that,” he said.
In reality, negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary Americans, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics.
“We know that they also destroy household savings and long-term retirement security,” she said. “It’s a move that supports stock markets, not personal savings.”
And to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual, a large number of households have still been left behind, McBride said. “We’ve seen scant evidence that Americans, en masse, have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security,” he said.
“Regardless of what the headline is… I would think it’s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you’re not participating in it,” Cole said.","['argued', 'protectionist']"
"As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-shows-that-christian-white-nationalism-is-a-much-greater-threat-to-the-us-than-radical-islam/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,51.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On March 15, Politico reported that according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the terrorist group ISIS — in its al Naba newsletter — was advising its members to avoid traveling to Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic and offered tips on social distancing and ways to avoid becoming infected (including frequent handwashing). ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['truthers', 'death', 'cult', 'white', 'nationalist']"
So conservative activists are turning to their favorite weapons — bad faith and distraction — to advance an agenda of gender inequality.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/republicans-want-to-make-sex-discrimination-legal-and-theyre-moving-fast/,alternet,gender,left,51.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"There are many reasons that Republicans and conservative activists love Donald Trump, but among the top must be that he makes it much easier for them to enact their wildly unpopular agenda. Trump’s all-consuming ability to grab the headlines and dominate news coverage creates an opportunity for the far right to push for its regressive agenda, safe in the knowledge that such efforts (understandably) will get little attention from a media addicted to the Trump Show.
Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to the conservative battle to make sex discrimination legal. This fight is a particularly difficult one for the right, politically speaking. While Americans still cling to sexist gender roles at home, overwhelming majorities believe that sex discrimination in public spaces should be illegal. So conservative activists are turning to their favorite weapons — bad faith and distraction — to advance an agenda of gender inequality.
On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to analyze the possibility of amending the U.S. Constitution so that it explicitly bars discrimination based on sex. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) simply states that that equal rights cannot be denied “on account of sex.” It was first introduced in 1923, but ratification of it became a serious issue in the 1970s, when feminist activists began convincing states to ratify it. They got famously and tantalizingly close, falling just three states short of ratification before hitting a 1982 deadline created by Congress.
While many have long assumed the ERA is forever dead, like Jon Snow, it’s rising again. Two more states have ratified the amendment and now activists are arguing that the deadline set by Congress in the 70s is invalid, since the Constitution doesn’t give Congress that power. Tuesday’s hearing was focused on this question: If a 38th state ratifies the ERA, what can and should happen next?
“A few years ago, a great woman, a great person, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was asked in an interview what amendment she would most like to see added to the United States Constitution,” said Rep. Stephen Cohen, D-Tenn., during his opening remarks at Tuesday’s hearing. “She answered it would be the Equal Rights Amendment.”
But while conservative activists’ efforts have largely flown under the radar, it’s safe to say they have pulled out all the stops in their fight to keep the ERA out of the Constitution, and in fact to roll back existing protections against sex discrimination that progressives have already secured.
One flank of the attack is focused on the states. A number of state legislatures are looking at the possibility of becoming the 38th (and deciding) state to ratify the ERA, and in every case legislators are being swarmed by right-wing activists who don’t hesitate to use deceit and hysteria to stop this from happening.
In April in Missouri, anti-feminist activists leaned heavily on Republican legislators, using the scare word “abortion” in order to stoke opposition to equal rights. And sure enough, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Dave Schatz, came out against the ERA, saying that the “majority of this [amendment] is about abortion” and claiming that Jesus would oppose it. (Jesus’ known positions on issues of human equality would suggest otherwise.)
Virginia came within a hair of ratifying the ERA, but because the 2017 state elections were so close that the Republicans literally held their legislative majority by a coin toss, the ratification was killed. Once again, anti-abortion hysterics played a major role in the fight, with conservatives falsely accusing Democrats of wanting to legalize infanticide, all as part of a sexist campaign to demonize any effort to secure equality for women.
Even during Tuesday’s federal congressional hearing, Republicans were at it again. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., warned that “the people’s right to protect the unborn would be eliminated if the ERA was to pass,” and argued that women’s equality should not be enshrined in the Constitution lest it damage the ability of conservatives to meddle in women’s medical care access.
But, as Kamala Lopez of Equal Means Equal and legal expert Wendy Murphy told Salon, the legislative fights are only part of the picture. They expressed concern about a series of cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear that are billed as LGBTQ cases in the media, but, legally speaking, are also about the issue of sex discrimination.
The three cases, which will be bundled into one before the Supreme Court, all involve LGBTQ workers being fired for their identity. In two cases, the workers were fired for being gay and in the third, a woman was fired for being trans. The court is expected to examine whether or not these firings constitute sex discrimination that violates both state laws and the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The pro-LGBTQ side is arguing that this case is covered by a precedent set in 1988, when the Supreme Court decided it was a form of illegal sex discrimination to penalize employees for failing to perform their gender in a way that pleases their bosses. In that case, a woman was able to successfully argue that her employer had discriminated against her by denying her a promotion unless she learned to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.” Forcing employees to conform to gender stereotypes, the court decided, was in itself a form of sex discrimination.
LGBTQ advocates argue that if employers expect employees to be straight, or to adhere to a gender identity assigned at birth, that is a form of gender stereotyping that should, under this precedent, be illegal. Many feminist legal experts worry that if the court rules against the LGBTQ employees in these cases, it will not only set back LGBTQ rights but will also make it easier to discriminate against women on a much larger scale.
“These cases are designed to strike at the very heart of the law’s understanding of what it means to discriminate against someone because of their sex or their gender,” Imani Gandy, a legal expert at Rewire, explained in a recent “Boom! Lawyered” podcast. She goes on to note that a hostile decision in this case could lead to “firing a gay man for not being sufficiently ‘macho'” or to employers paying women less “because of a belief that men should be the heads of households.”
(Full disclosure: My partner, Marc Faletti, is executive producer of the “Boom! Lawyered” podcast.)
As Murphy explained in a follow-up email to Salon, she believes part of the reason the Supreme Court is taking the case now is part of a conservative divide-and-conquer strategy. Unfortunately, some feminist organizations have been reluctant to back a robust definition of “sex discrimination” that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. So these cases create an opportunity to chip away at progressive solidarity between these causes and weaken the movement against sex discrimination overall.
Whether in the courts or the legislatures, the right is pursuing an elaborate strategy to attack women’s equality and preserve sex discrimination by coming at the issue sideways. Instead of flatly admitting to opposing women’s legal equality, conservatives are hiding behind more provocative or “controversial” issues such as abortion rights or trans rights, which are less politically popular than the ERA, as a way of derailing efforts to fight sex discrimination.
Conservatives also know they have to move fast. Support for both abortion rights and LGBTQ equality are rising, making it harder to exploit the controversies around both to undermine women’s equality. That’s why the right is seizing this moment to step up efforts to stop the ERA and undermine existing protections against sex discrimination. Anti-equality activists understand they might not have another chance.","['favorite', 'weapons', 'bad', 'faith', 'distraction']"

In a op-ed for Foreign Policy, Allen tore into Donald Trump and his orders to attack American citizens in front of the White House. Allen said he fears we are “witnessing the beginning of the end of American democracy.”
In a three-part breakdown of how Trump has failed this moment and the nation, (Ret.) Gen. Allen specifically called out this administration singling out antifa—a leaderless movement that is, by definition, anti-fascist—as a terrorist group while ignoring the white supremacists who have been proven to be inciting violence at some of these protests. Allen said: “Far more damage to the United States has come from these terrorists—fascists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis, all feeling newly empowered today—than those who have opposed them.”
For the record, the FBI found “no intelligence linking Antifa to violence at the Black Lives Matter protests.”
Allen wasn’t the only former Marine general to come forward. General Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis, who served as Trump’s secretary of defense for a stint, has finally come forward with his own warning: ”We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.” In a statement to CNN, Mattis said: “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us.”
That, of course, drove Donald Trump to rage because he quickly tweeted saying he had fired Mattis, essentially saying he was a disgruntled employee. That sparked another former general, John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff, to immediately correct the record:
“The president did not fire him. He did not ask for his resignation,” Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, said in an interview. “The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then The got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.”
The aforementioned disagreement was Trump’s still-curious decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.
On Tuesday, retired U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, who served as the 17th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also took aim at Trump’s brutal policies against American citizens. In an op-ed in The Atlantic, Mullen said he “cannot remain silent” anymore.
It sickened me yesterday to see security personnel—including members of the National Guard—forcibly and violently clear a path through Lafayette Square to accommodate the president’s visit outside St. John’s Church. I have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump’s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent.
In fact, a steady stream of retired senior military officials are using social media to speak out this week. That should alarm every single American. They are trying to tell us all that the president is unfit for duty.

After Donald Trump’s outrageous photo op in which he used federal police to attack peaceful protesters so that he could walk to a church to hold up a Bible, others noted how inappropriate it was for General Mark Milley, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to not only be tailing behind Donald Trump during this publicized stunt but to be wearing his battle fatigues, something extremely inappropriate for the setting. Retired Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden noted as much on Twitter.
I was appalled to see him in his battle dress. Milley (he’s a general?!?) should not have walked over to the church with Trump. https://t.co/XOew3WstT5 — Gen Michael Hayden (@GenMhayden) June 2, 2020
America’s retired military commandeers are speaking out and sounding the alarm. The real question is: Where are Republicans? Why do they remain silent while our democracy is being burned to the ground on national television? It’s clear to all Donald Trump is unfit for duty, so why do they continue to enable him? It’s only possible with their consent. When this all ends, they must be held accountable too.","['failed', 'white']"
President Donald Trump clearly wasn’t pleased on Wednesday when he learned that his former Defense Secretary James Mattis had spoken out against him. So the president responded in his usual and predictable way: lashing out on Twitter.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-lashes-out-at-james-mattis-with-a-laughable-lie/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,51.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Donald Trump clearly wasn’t pleased on Wednesday when he learned that his former Defense Secretary James Mattis had spoken out against him. So the president responded in his usual and predictable way: lashing out on Twitter.
“Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General,” Trump wrote. “I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about. His nickname was ‘Chaos’, which I didn’t like, & changed it to ‘Mad Dog’.”
This was an obvious and laughable lie. At the time Trump announced Mattis as his new Defense secretary during the presidential transition, it was widely known that Mattis had been called “Mad Dog” for years. Trump seemed especially enamored with the nickname then. The Military Times reported that Trump previously made this odd claim about Mattis’ nickname in March, though reports of the name can be found as far back as 2004.
When Mattis testified before the Senate for his confirmation hearing, he explained: “That nickname was given to me by the press, and some of you may have experienced similar occasions with the press where perhaps they didn’t get it quite right.” CNN reported that the nickname wasn’t used by people who are actually close to Mattis.
Trump’s claim that he asked for Mattis’ resignation also doesn’t hold up. Mattis’ departure was widely covered at the time in December of 2018, and his resignation letter made a huge impact because it seemed to sharply criticize Trump. What is true, though, is that while Mattis intended to stay on for another two months, Trump forced him out much more quickly than he intended.
In addition to distorting the past, Trump also disparaged Mattis’s job performance, despite the fact that he let the general lead the Pentagon for two years and personally appointed him.
“His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‘brought home the bacon’,” Trump added. “I didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!”
When he was running for president, Trump repeatedly said he’d succeed by hiring the best people. But over and over, top officials leave the administration in disgrace or disgust, and Trump suddenly seems to think they’re not so great after all.","['lashing', 'out', 'usual', 'and', 'predictable']"
"As the president spoke about doing “a lot” to address gun violence, while also emphasizing mental health, it was hard not to think of one of the first bills Trump signed into law.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-response-the-latest-mass-shootings-came-short?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma,msnbc,gun-control,left,51.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural address included some memorable rhetoric, but it was the new president’s references to violence that stood out. The Republican lamented the crimes “that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”
Trump added, “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”
As the public once again tries to process the death toll from the latest American mass shootings, it’s painfully obvious that the “carnage” did not, in fact, “stop.” Complicating matters, in too many instances, the perpetrators of violence have justified their brutal crimes by echoing political rhetoric they heard from their president.
As a Washington Post piece put it yesterday afternoon, “After yet another mass slaying, the question surrounding the president is no longer whether he will respond as other presidents once did, but whether his words contributed to the carnage.”
It was against this backdrop that Trump briefly spoke to reporters yesterday afternoon, saying, “Hate has no place in our country and we’re going to take care of it.”
Likely aware of the critics who’ve tied his rhetoric to some of the shooters’ motivations, the president added, “This has been going on for years – for years and years – in our country.”
It was at this point that Trump thought it’d be a good idea to start bragging.
“We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it does – it’s not – really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done. “But this is also a mental illness problem. If you look at both of these cases, this is mental illness. These are people – really, people that are very, very seriously mentally ill. So a lot of things are happening.”
As the president spoke about doing “a lot” to address gun violence, while also emphasizing mental health, it was hard not to think of one of the first bills Trump signed into law.
In early 2017, congressional Republicans passed, and the new president signed, a measure to make it easier for the mentally impaired to buy guns. The White House’s budget plans have also proposed significant cuts that, if implemented, would’ve limited access to mental-health services for many Americans.
For that matter, Trump and his party continue to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, which would, among other things, strip many Americans’ access to mental-health services.
What’s more, let’s not accept the premise of the president’s rhetoric at face value. To hear Trump tell it, the perpetrators of mass shootings are sick, so the focus should be on mental health. As important as this element is, it’s an argument predicated on the idea that toxic societal elements aren’t significant, too.
I’m glad Trump believes “hate has no place in our country,” but given the number of dangerous radicals who find solace in his presidency, those seven words aren’t sufficient.
He’s scheduled to deliver additional remarks on the subject in a couple of hours. Watch this space.
Postscript: On Twitter this morning, Trump suggested tying a background-check bill to immigration reform. The connections between the two are tenuous, at best – the gunmen weren’t immigrants – and the chances of Congress packaging the issues are poor.
What was less clear, however, was whether Trump was drawing a conditional connection. Should we interpret this morning’s tweets as him saying he’ll sign a background-check bill only if Congress meets his demands on immigration policy?",['hard']
How far will Republicans go to destroy democracy?,https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/how-far-will-republicans-go-to-destroy-democracy/#.XSY6699P5zg.twitter,alternet,gun-control,left,52.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Even before the latest Supreme Court decisions approving hyper-partisan gerrymandering and effectively allowing the addition of a citizenship question to the census, experts have wondered aloud whether Republicans remain committed to democracy. Toward the end of a recent plenary panel on Supreme Court reform at the American Constitution Society’s national convention, University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq suggested, “We don’t really know how committed the Republican Party is to the project of democracy.”
If the GOP still values the rule of law, then perhaps the danger to democracy will recede after President Trump leaves office. But if the GOP no longer cares about democracy, then our political system could be in peril. Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.
Unfortunately, the answer to Huq’s question is clear. The Republican Party is not at all committed to democracy, and GOP leaders and voters would happily tolerate alternative political arrangements. That is a worrisome claim, to be sure, but the evidence is indisputable. Republicans have abandoned any concerns they may have had for the integrity of our political system.
First, as is well understood, the GOP spent the past generation undermining the foundations of democracy — free and fair elections — so as to reinforce white rule. Thanks to the GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box. Due to the Supreme Court’s evisceration of campaign finance law, unlimited and unaccountable dark money floods our politics.
Sophisticated redistricting software enables Republicans to force Democrats to waste millions of votes, leading to highly skewed electoral outcomes. These decades-long assaults required systematically coordinated tactics, such as the 50-year campaign that led to the Supreme Court’s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. The evisceration of democracy is no accident.
Second, the GOP is structurally committed to lying. “Structurally committed” means that party leaders have little if any choice in the matter. They have to lie. And this has nothing to do with Donald Trump. One of the first things that Newt Gingrich’s Republican House majority did upon assuming power in 1995 was to undermine evidence-based policy by killing the Office of Technology Assessment and slashing the funding of the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office.
Why? Republicans must disavow factual evidence because neither wing of the party (the corporate wing or the resentment wing) can tell the truth about what it stands for. The corporate wing cannot admit that it cares exclusively about tax cuts for the rich and corporate deregulation, so it has to lie about what it does. That’s why the 2002 handout to oil, gas and coal companies was called the “Clear Skies Initiative.” That’s why the 2009-2010 health care debate was framed in terms of “death panels,”as if private insurance does not ration care. That’s why the 2017 tax cut for corporations and elites was sold as a middle-class tax cut.
Nor can the resentment wing of the GOP speak honestly about the paranoid basis of its preferences. (Interestingly, Donald Trump occasionally comes close, such as when he refers to Mexicans as “rapists.”) Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they fear black people. “Pro-lifers” cannot admit that they oppose abortion because they are afraid of what would happen if women controlled their bodies. (If they truly supported life, after all, they would fight climate change).
Anti-statists (of the Ruby Ridge or “Oregon standoff” variety) cannot admit that they oppose the public sector because they think government programs are for black people. Xenophobes cannot admit that they oppose immigration because they think brown people are dirty. (How often do you hear them oppose illegal immigration from Canada?) Religious extremists cannot admit that they oppose feminism and LGBTQ people because they are afraid of out-of-control sex. Neither the capitalist nor the resentment wing of the GOP can tell the truth, and that’s why the party is structurally committed to lying. As historian Timothy Snyder has explained, when a political party becomes unmoored from fact, anything is possible.
Third, the GOP has paved the way for the collapse of civilization due to climate change. While it is difficult, psychologically, to confront what’s at stake, some experts have concluded that we have already passed the point at which the collapse of humanity is inevitable, and that civilizational collapse will occur soon. The GOP, of course, has resisted mitigation of the climate crisis for decades. Even the most despicable regimes on earth, such as Syria’s, have signed onto the Paris agreement, but the GOP continues to do everything in its power to obstruct even modest reforms. The collapse of civilization will be worse than genocide, yet the GOP is happy to enable it. If a political party is willing to facilitate an outcome worse than genocide, then why would it oppose authoritarianism? The answer is that it would not.
President Trump, of course, poses an extreme threat to the rule of law. But President Trump is not the root of the problem. Nor is the GOP’s willingness to destroy “democratic norms” the root of the problem. Both Trump and GOP norm-breaking are symptoms, not causes. The root of the Republican radicalism is the triangular relationship among capital (e.g., the Koch brothers), the right-wing media (e.g., Fox News), and resentment voters (whom Hillary Clinton accurately labeled “deplorables”), the latter being the roughly 40 percent of the public who still believe Trump is doing a good job.
Long after Trump leaves the scene, Fox News will continue to manufacture paranoia to motivate resentment voters to vote for capitalists who will head to Washington to lower taxes, deregulate the economy and undermine democracy. The GOP’s capital wing cares about tax cuts and deregulation and, thanks to Fox News, has an unlimited capacity to manufacture paranoia. Its resentment wing cares about making scapegoats suffer, and has an unlimited capacity for consuming paranoia. Neither wing cares about anything else. Not fairness. Not national interest. Not democracy. Not the rule of law. From this perspective, Trump’s presidency is a gift that exposes how the machinery of the GOP works and what’s at stake in its operation.
Many progressives entertain a fantasy that the GOP can be de-radicalized at the ballot box. After all, only 40 percent of the electorate supports Trump. Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett summarized this view before last year’s midterms: “There is only one thing we can do, which is stamp out this form of Republicanism, defeat it completely and govern without them until they learn that there’s a price to be paid for the kind of politics they’ve practiced.”
Unfortunately, however, the GOP cannot be de-radicalized at the ballot box. Democrats already thrashed the GOP in wave elections in 1992, 2006, 2008 and 2018, yet after each election, the Republican Party became even more radical. After its 2012 defeat, the GOP even concluded in a self-administered autopsy that it needed to de-radicalize — and then lined up behind Trump just a few years later.
Even the most mild-mannered Republican, such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, must govern, once in office, as a radical, no matter how sweet their smile or how gentle their manner. They are just as captured by the triangular relationship between capital, right-wing media and resentment as their more explicitly frothy colleagues. Brett Kavanaugh, after all, hails from the genteel, country club wing of the GOP, yet it took no time at all for him to unveil his radicalism, in both style and substance, at his confirmation hearing.",['destroy']

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
President Donald Trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in Davos on Tuesday to make the case that ordinary Americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration’s “America first” maxim.
At the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, Trump argued that a regime of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class.
“Every decision we make on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday Americans,” Trump said, adding that “the well-being of the American worker” was paramount.
On CNBC, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow echoed the president’s assertions. “Inequality is diminishing right now,” he said. “I think we’re in a better place.”
Many mainstream economists hold a different opinion. While low unemployment and steadily — if slowly — rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower-income Americans, these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few.
“The economic backdrop is such that people’s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement… “It’s debatable what all of that’s attributable to,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

In spite of higher incomes, significant wealth-building among the middle class has not manifested, McBride pointed out. “More people are working, more people are making money. The extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security, such as boosting emergency savings, retirement savings or paying down debt, is still unclear,” he said.
The Republicans’ corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
“The Tax Policy Center says that two-thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution, with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains,” he said.
“I don’t particularly feel that it’s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape,” said Scott Cole, founder and president of Cole Financial Planning and Wealth Management.
Economists point out that Trump’s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit, a growth-sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing, even as the stock market has notched record highs.
“There’s no way that what’s happening right now under a Republican administration is fiscal conservatism,” Cole said.
In his Davos speech, Trump revisited another favorite topic, negative interest rates. “They get paid to borrow money, something I could get used to very quickly. Love that,” he said.
In reality, negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary Americans, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics.
“We know that they also destroy household savings and long-term retirement security,” she said. “It’s a move that supports stock markets, not personal savings.”
And to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual, a large number of households have still been left behind, McBride said. “We’ve seen scant evidence that Americans, en masse, have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security,” he said.
“Regardless of what the headline is… I would think it’s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you’re not participating in it,” Cole said.","['pale', 'in', 'comparison']"
"Remarkably, the first three years of Trump’s presidency were relatively smooth sailing outside of self-inflicted crimes and mishaps. His actual approach to life was never fully tested in the Oval Office. Now, with the first real challenge of his presidency, he is utterly adrift.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/poor-donald-trump-has-no-fixer-to-make-covid-19-go-away/,alternet,coronavirus,left,52.0,3.0,Biased,No agreement,"“I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine, it’s gonna go away, and we’re not going to see it again, hopefully.”
Donald Trump said something Friday that should have ended his re-election prospects the moment it left his mouth:
Of course, viruses don’t just “go away” regardless of the amount of propaganda or wishful thinking you throw at them. His theory, however, is telling. Trump’s strategy from the beginning of this crisis has been to minimize the threat and wish it away. His refusal to initiate a comprehensive federal testing-and-contact-tracing program has as much to do with his refusal to acknowledge the seriousness of the pandemic as it does with the Republican laissez-faire approach to public policy.
Still, why would Trump say this? The usual conservative response to a public crisis is that it doesn’t really exist and the free market will magically fix it, anyway. It’s not that the problem will disappear on its own, which is a small child’s response to challenges.
The simple answer is that, ever since he was a young man, Trump has never had to confront any problem that somebody else didn’t just make disappear. Trump has always used an army of attorneys, accountants and corrupted officials to make his problems go away—whether it was with women, creditors, contractors, or law enforcement. Usually, he would have a main consligiere to take on the heaviest burdens, from the detestable Roy Cohn to Michael Cohen to Roger Stone to Rudy Giuliani and, most recently, his own personal Attorney General William Barr. Now that he is president, Trump views the entire federal government as his personal fiefdom to clean up his messes and cover for his open corruption.
But a virus is immune to the protections to which Trump has become accustomed. It does what it does, and Trump finds himself helpless and flummoxed.
There has never been a crisis so big in Trump’s life that he hasn’t been able to use people much more talented and intelligent than himself to make it go away quietly and efficiently. So in Trump’s experience, that’s what problems do: They go away. He has “good genes”; he surrounds himself with “the best people”—willing to cross any moral line for him and bad things just … disappear. All he has to do in the meantime is manage the press with a con man’s combination of razzle dazzle and intimidation. Actual work and accountability are for suckers and lesser people.
Casinos going bankrupt? Take the money and have the accountants stiff the investors. Affairs with porn stars while your wife was pregnant? Have your fixer pay them off. Real estate taxes a problem? Have some employees bribe the assessors. FBI Director threatening to expose your collusion with a hostile foreign power? Fire him by way of a patsy. Tough re-election campaign? Have your lawyer threaten a foreign country if they don’t make up a scandal about your opponent. And so on.
Remarkably, the first three years of Trump’s presidency were relatively smooth sailing outside of self-inflicted crimes and mishaps. His actual approach to life was never fully tested in the Oval Office. Now, with the first real challenge of his presidency, he is utterly adrift.
There is no amount of misdirection or intimidation he can use to make the press stories about all the deaths and economic destruction go away. There is no accountant, lawyer, or public official who can use clever paperwork to make the virus disappear. Solving this problem would require the sort of dedicated attention, tough choices, and hard work that Donald Trump has been able to spend his entire life successfully avoiding while thinking himself clever for doing so.
Trump merely asserts that coronavirus will just fix itself. If you think about it, that actually makes some sense, because every other problem in his Trump’s life has.","['Remarkably', 'utterly', 'adrift']"
"He is asking President Trump, a fellow climate change disbeliever and another white nationalist, for help with dousing the fires.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/white-nationalism-and-crony-capitalism-are-the-sparks-that-started-fires-in-the-amazon/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,52.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The man-made Amazon fires are for clearing the land of its forests and indigenous people. The benefits are for Jair Bolsonaro’s cronies, while producing a climate disaster for the world.
The Amazon fires in Brazil have become worldwide news. Explaining the fires recently, Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said that “August 2019 stands out” as a month with a far higher number of fires than any preceding year since 2010.
This is similar to what Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) had reported earlier. The head of INPE, Ricardo Galvao, was fired on August 2 this year after INPE came out with figures based on satellite imagery that showed that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon had increased by 40 percent in two months over a similar period last year.
That it is largely man-made can be seen from looking at where the fires have started in Brazil: mostly along the major highways and spreading into the forest. Clearly, it is an attempt to clear the forests for economic exploitation—logging, cattle ranching, commercial farming and mining—that lies at the heart of President Bolsonaro’s policies.
Speaking to reporters in the last week of August, Bolsonaro said, “It is too much land for so few Indians.” While he has declared a temporary moratorium on land-clearing due to the fires, the thrust of his policies is still to dismantle all obstacles to handing over the Amazon to big corporate and landed interests in Brazil.
Amazon forests are the world’s biggest store of carbon as well as its largest global sink. If it goes up in smoke, it will produce climate change on a scale not seen before. And this change could soon become irreversible, as once a forest starts dying, after a point, it becomes almost impossible to stop its downward plunge.
Apart from acting to fix atmospheric carbon, Amazon forests also help in the hydrological cycle that produces rainfall. The loss of forest cover in the Amazon would affect not only the world’s climate, but also the local climate in Brazil and neighboring countries, leading to less rainfall, and adversely affecting its agriculture.
While Brazil has taken the lead in a direct attack on the Amazon, with Bolsonaro adding a racial element to his attack on indigenous people, the pressure to open the Amazonian forests to agriculture, logging and mining is not just limited to Brazil. Obviously, why should other countries, which have finished their forests, argue that countries with forests keep them permanently for global benefit? Who pays and who gains is very much a part of the climate change negotiations—the Paris Accord—from which Trump and the United States have walked out.
This pitch—who pays and who gains—could indeed be a nationalist pitch for Brazil. But this is not Bolsonaro’s argument. For him, the only issue is that fires lit for clearing the Amazon should not burn without control: he must be shedding tears about all those logs that could have been sold for money going up in smoke.
He is asking President Trump, a fellow climate change disbeliever and another white nationalist, for help with dousing the fires. He has no sympathy for Brazil’s indigenous people—“Indians,” he calls them—bemoaning the failure of the Brazilian cavalry in “clearing” its indigenous people, unlike the U.S. cavalry, which was so much more efficient in its “extermination of the Indians.”
Before we address the complex issue of climate justice, indigenous rights and economic development, we need to address one misunderstanding on the role of Amazon forests. Amazon forests do not produce 20 percent of the oxygen the world needs, as is commonly said. It is the largest producer of oxygen on land, producing about 6-9 percent of the total oxygen that is produced globally, including from the oceans. Still, we cannot talk of producing oxygen without also asking how much of it the Amazon consumes. So we must see the net oxygen that the Amazon produces, meaning, subtract the oxygen consumed by it from what it produces. Once we do that, we find that the Amazon’s net output of oxygen is near zero, as it is also the largest consumer of oxygen. The Amazon’s value is in fixing atmospheric carbon, and its loss will mean the release of stored carbon into the atmosphere with devastating consequences.
Is it possible to use the forest lands economically such that we do not have deforestation with both local and global consequences? The argument is yes, this can be done using scientific methods and technology, such that we can get short-term developmental benefits as well as meet long-term goals. This would be different from the colonial models promoting mono-cultures and claiming forests on behalf of the Crown, but would mean involving the forest communities in protecting forests. It would mean culling forests, but within limits of its regeneration and using a mix of trees that are natural to the Amazonian environment. It would mean, if mines and other projects are allowed in them, to minimize their impact and leave large areas as untouched natural reserves.
Of course, this would require a policy for indigenous people that respects their identity while allowing them to choose how they integrate themselves; not as living museum pieces, but as communities living in harmony with nature and the rest of Brazilian society. These are complex i ssues and there is no one answer to these questions. Their answer would mean a democracy that allows for dialogue and a way to reconcile the goals of development and maintains peoples’ identities and cultural diversities.
Instead of taking this complex, democratic path, the logic of capital is quite simple. It prioritizes the interest of the capitalists—not capital but capitalists—over other sections of the people. For the capitalist, there is a simple way of looking at any issue: what return can I get if I can get the state to follow a certain policy? Giving away of land, forests and mineral resources to capitalists by the state is what Marx called primary—or primitive—accumulation. In the language of the commons, it is “enclosure” of the commons, and in this case, the Amazon forests are the commons.
If Bolsonaro can hand over forest lands—its trees, its minerals and their use after clearing forests for cattle-ranching or soybean-farming—to his capitalist cronies, they make big bucks. This is the crux of Bolsonaro’s policies. This is similar to what Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing in India with the recent modification to the Forest Rights Act.
Both Brazil and India are expropriating the people’s rights over natural resources on a grand scale. This is what capital and their ideologues call releasing the animal spirits of capital.
Capitalism not only has the Trumps, Modis and Bolsonaros determine that what is good for capital is good for the people, but also other ideologues. One of them, American economist William Nordhaus, has built an economic model that essentially “shows” that it is better to spend money, not on preventing climate change today, but mitigating it in the future. There are two fallacies in this approach. One is that those producing climate change—either directly, through their emissions, or by consuming products that produce carbon emissions—are going to be impacted far less than those who produce much lower carbon emissions.
Unfortunately, the impact of such climate change is going to be far more adverse in tropical and equatorial regions of the world, where the bulk of the poor live. They also produce much less carbon emissions. The other flaw in Nordhaus-type models is that they privilege benefits received today over adverse effects in the future, the same way a capitalist looks at his profits: this quarter’s profits matter more than the long-term sustainability of capitalism itself.
Are other approaches and models possible? Yes, of course. A number of approaches that address both these issues exist. But climate science today has little to do with science; it is politics and the interests of capital that are deciding our climate future. Upton Sinclair, the American writer, had written in the 1930s, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”
Denying global warming is not a scientific mistake that the global right makes; it is simply who is paying the bill that determines their belief.

Team Trump simply decided to consider changes that would have dramatic effects on those who rely on the social-insurance programs.,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-eyes-plan-reduce-poverty-redefining-it,msnbc,middle-class,left,52.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"There are official metrics the government utilizes to determine eligibility for social-insurance programs. So, for example, for low-income Americans to get food stamps, they have to fall within the poverty threshold.
With this in mind, the Trump administration reportedly hopes to reduce poverty in the United States, not by making a material difference in struggling families’ finances, but by tinkering with the threshold for what counts as poverty.
As the Washington Post’s Helaine Olen explained in a piece last night:
The Trump administration wants to lower the poverty rate in the United States. But there’s a catch: If the plan under discussion is enacted, it would cut the number of people living in poverty not by giving them a wage increase, but by defining them out of it. “Instead of actually doing anything to cut poverty in America, Trump is trying to fudge the numbers to artificially ‘reduce’ the U.S. poverty rate,” said Rebecca Vallas, vice president of the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the Center for American Progress. “It’s mathematical gaslighting.”
As a practical matter, the ideas under consideration are similar to Republican proposals to cut Social Security: if officials change the way in which inflation adjustments are made, fewer would have access to benefits.
None of this is necessary or legally required, of course. Team Trump simply decided to consider changes that would have dramatic effects on those who rely on the social-insurance programs.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities published a related analysis yesterday:
If the poverty line is altered in this fashion, fewer individuals and families will qualify over time for various forms of assistance, including many who work hard but are paid low wages. That’s because using a lower measure of inflation like the chained CPI to adjust the poverty line each year would make the eligibility thresholds for various programs that serve people in need lower and lower over time, compared with what the thresholds otherwise would be. This, in turn, would lower the income eligibility limits for programs like SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) and Medicaid, which are tied to the federal poverty line. It also would reduce the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) premium tax credits — and thereby increase the out-of-pocket premium charges faced by millions of people who purchase health insurance through the ACA marketplaces.
The change isn’t yet official or final, though the Office of Management and Budget – which I think is still technically led by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – formally proposed a regulatory change this week.
In doing so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities added, the administration “presented no research on how low-income families’ costs for basic necessities has changed over time, the adequacy of the poverty line itself as compared to the cost of basic necessities, or the implications of changing the poverty line for individuals’ and families’ access to needed assistance.”
A cynic might wonder if the administration is just clumsily pursuing such a change to scratch an ideological itch.","['dramatic', 'simply', 'effects']"

"When the nation's highest civilian honor went to a right-wing media personality, it served as an oddly appropriate capstone to Trump's broader goals.",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/strategy-laid-bare-trump-sees-value-national-division-n1131336,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,52.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"At an event in Michigan last week, Donald Trump referenced the U.S. House vote on impeachment and how pleased he was with the final vote tally. ""We won 196 to nothing,"" the president said. For emphasis, he added soon after, ""196 to nothing.""
In reality, the vote on the first article of impeachment was 230 to 197, while the vote on the second article was 229 to 198. But in Trump's mind, it was a shutout in the other direction -- because the votes from the Democrats and Congress' lone independent, in a rather literal sense, didn't count.
I thought of this watching Donald Trump's State of the Union address because it was a continuation of the theme: the president seems vaguely aware of the existence of his political opponents, but he's convinced himself that they simply don't count, and as a consequence, there's no point in acknowledging them, reaching out to them, or trying to find common ground with them.
In 2020, the state of our union is bitter, but that's not an accident of circumstance; it's the end result of a deliberate strategy, hatched by a president who believes toxicity works in his favor.

I don't generally see political developments the way the Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan does, but her reaction to Donald Trump's State of the Union rang true:
""This is a big night, a cleaved down the middle night with no one trying to hide the divide. No ameliorating courtesy, no enacting of formal regard. Just the great divide, unhidden and out there for all the world to see.""
There was no meaningful pretext. The president, poised to be acquitted in an impeachment trial led in part by Senate jurors who've acknowledged his guilt, saw value last night in trying to tear the country apart -- confident that his chunk would be bigger than his rivals'.
He lied about matters large and small. He refused to shake House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's outstretched hand. He talked up a divisive culture war. He saw no need to extend an olive branch to his partisan foes -- those who happen to hold the majority of one chamber of Congress -- because he apparently didn't care if they were inclined to accept it.
When First Lady Melania Trump put the nation's highest civilian honor around the neck of a right-wing media personality, it served as an oddly appropriate capstone to the president's broader goals. The New York Times reported:
In an unusual departure from protocol, Rush Limbaugh was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Trump during the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, one day after the conservative talk show host revealed that he had advanced lung cancer. Mr. Limbaugh, 69, sat next to the first lady, Melania Trump, in the gallery of the House of Representatives, where he joined Venezuela's opposition leader, a top border patrol agent and several other guests of Mr. Trump.... The first lady presented the medal, which is usually bestowed during a ceremony at the White House, to Mr. Limbaugh.
Limbaugh's rhetorical record is too lengthy to review in a single blog post, but a compelling Media Matters' assessment noted that Trump ""conferred one of the nation's great civilian honors upon a man who has trafficked in hate and is responsible for some of the most vile degradations of the nation's political discourse.""
As disappointing as it may be to see the president cheapen the Medal of Freedom -- again -- it wasn't exactly surprising. Limbaugh is on Trump's ""team,"" and last night's national address was intended to send a signal that the president is indifferent to those who are not.
It's also a sign of things to come. Election Day is 39 weeks away, and Trump used his State of the Union address to signal his intentions: the next nine months will be devoted to motivating the Republican Party's far-right base, ensuring they're both satisfied and electrified.
Buckle up.

"Not only would House Bill 2320 rescind the rights for same-sex marriage, it also would cement into law a litany of far right wing extremist claims, including that being LGBTQ is a “mythology,” government recognition of LGBTQ people is “the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence,” and the proposition that there “are no ex-blacks but there are thousands of ex-gays.”",https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/kansas-lawmakers-file-bill-voiding-same-sex-marriages-that-resembles-an-anti-lgbtq-manifesto-of-hate/,alternet,gender,left,52.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Nearly four years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marriage, Republicans in the Kansas House of Representatives have filed legislation that aims to void same-sex marriage.
Not only would House Bill 2320 rescind those rights, it also would cement into law a litany of far right wing extremist claims, including that being LGBTQ is a “mythology,” government recognition of LGBTQ people is “the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence,” and the proposition that there “are no ex-blacks but there are thousands of ex-gays.”
HB 2320, if it were to become law, would designate all existing marriages between same-sex spouses “parody marriages” that “erode community standards of decency.” It also would place LGBTQ people in the same class of people who practice bestiality.
In an obvious violation of the First Amendment, the bill would strip away the religious rights of LGBTQ people by declaring they are all Secular Humanists.
The assertions in the lengthy, 8-page bill are extreme, and reveal a basis in anti-LGBTQ hate from “persecuted Christians,” according to the text of the bill.
“The sworn testimonies of ex-gays, medical experts, persecuted Christians and licensed ministers demonstrate that there is no real proof that a gay gene exists,” begins one passage. It adds that “the idea that sexual orientation is predicated on immutability is not proven,” and “sexual orientation is a mythology, dogma, doctrine or orthodoxy that is inseparably linked to the religion of secular humanism.”
Another passage falsely suggests the LGBTQ community is so well “organized” there is a “daily code” its members observe. Daily KOS says the bill implies “LGBTQ is actually a secret society.”
“The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) community is organized, full and has a daily code by which members may guide their daily lives, which makes it a denominational sect that is inseparably part of the religion of secular humanism.”
To be clear, that is false.
“Instead of having a cross, the ten commandments icon, or star and crescent, the LGBTQ secular humanist community has the gay pride rainbow colored flag to symbolize its faith-based worldview,” the bill also claims. That, too, is false.
The bill creates a religion it calls “LGBTQ secular humanism,” which does not exist. It then falsely declares that “the government’s endorsement of LGBTQ secular humanism has not been about ‘tolerance,’ but ‘dominance.'” And it claims that “many citizens who object to the government’s endorsement of LGBTQ secular humanism is not based on ‘bigotry,’ but on ‘biology,'” which, again, is false.
The lawmakers also attack the popular phrase, “love is love,” declaring that “when a secular humanist says that ‘love is love,’ what they really mean is that they are amenable to government assets being used to oppress and marginalize anyone who disagrees with their beliefs.”
LGBTQ people, the bill claims, seek “to infiltrate public schools and public libraries with the intent to indoctrinate and proselytize minors to their religious worldview on faith, morality, sex and marriage with the government’s stamp of approval.”
The lawmakers who penned HB 2320 perversely point to “the civil rights movement lead by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.” to support their false claims, ignoring the fact that Coretta Scott King has repeatedly said her husband would have supported the LGBTQ civil rights movement.
The lawmakers who are the initial sponsors of the Kansas bill are Republican Representatives Randy Garber, Owen Donohoe, David French, Cheryl Helmer, Ron Highland, Steve Huebert, and Bill Rhiley.
Garber is the bill’s lead sponsor, and says LGBTQ people are “trying to force their beliefs on society.”
The Wichita Eagle notes the legislation “comes just months after voters elected the state’s first openly gay lawmakers and less than two weeks after the introduction of a bill that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT individuals statewide.”
Tom Witt, the head of Equality Kansas, calls the bill the “most vile, hateful and disrespectful legislation” he’s ever seen.","['far', 'right', 'wing', 'extremist']"

"We could also point out how many of us said Trump and his party, unable to pay for their massive tax breaks for the wealthy, would invariably go after Medicare and Medicaid to help finance the tax giveaways – just as Republicans are doing now.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/medicare-trump-arrives-his-read-my-lips-moment,msnbc,middle-class,left,52.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In 1988, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush was seen by some in his party as too moderate, and he sought to assuage those concerns by vowing not to raise taxes. It became a central pillar of Bush’s national campaign, and was a key element to his success as a national candidate: “Read my lips,” he said. “No new taxes.”
As we’ve discussed before, it was a promise Bush decided not to keep. The Republican, needing to cut a budget deal with a Democratic Congress, eventually agreed to some tax increases, reluctantly abandoning his pledge as part of a 1990 package. Two years later, he lost his re-election bid.
Three decades later, another Republican is in the White House, and with the unveiling of his new budget, another Republican president has arrived at a “read-my-lips” moment of his own.
There’s a lot to chew on in Donald Trump’s new budget blueprint, but the Washington Post highlighted one of the key takeaways.
Trump’s “Budget for a Better America” also includes dozens of spending cuts and policy overhauls that frame the early stages of the debate for the 2020 election. For example, Trump for the first time calls for cutting $845 billion from Medicare, the popular health care program for the elderly that in the past he had largely said he would protect. His budget would also propose a major overhaul of Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans run jointly with states, by turning more power over to states. This would save $241 billion over 10 years.
We could turn our attention to the fact that Republicans spent much of the last decade falsely accusing Democrats of supporting Medicare cuts through the Affordable Care Act, only to have a GOP White House actually propose taking an ax to the social-insurance program.
We could also point out how many of us said Trump and his party, unable to pay for their massive tax breaks for the wealthy, would invariably go after Medicare and Medicaid to help finance the tax giveaways – just as Republicans are doing now.
But as important as those details are, I’m especially interested in the scope of Trump’s betrayal.
It’s easy to forget, but when Trump launched his presidential candidacy nearly four years ago, he was very far to the right on issues such as race and immigration, but he went out of his way to appear moderate on many other issues, especially social-insurance programs often known as “entitlements.”
As Trump argued in 2015, “I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican’s going to cut, and even if they wouldn’t, they don’t know what to do because they don’t know where the money is. I do. I do.”
It was a staple of the Republican’s platform. In his campaign kick-off speech, Trump said he’d make no cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. He bragged about the vow via Twitter, over and over and over again.
This promise played a key role in the inexperienced television personality’s bid to win the GOP nomination and ultimately the presidency. And yet, here we are, watching Trump, unable to pay for his tax breaks, go back on his word.
It’s possible, if not likely, that Trump and his political operation will say this doesn’t count as a broken promise because Congress won’t actually approve the proposed Medicare cuts. It’ll be a tough sell: the White House budget plan is supposed to reflect the president’s vision for federal investments. It’s a blueprint for how Trump would like to govern if he controlled all of the levers of power.
In other words, a budget makes plain a president’s values – and in 2019, this president values deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, despite all of his assurances to the contrary.
Postscript: Don’t be surprised if House Democrats bring Trump’s budget to the floor for a vote, just to see how many of the president’s GOP allies are prepared to go on the record supporting his vision.
Update: Trump didn’t just “evolve” on Medicare over the course of three years. As recently as November 2018 – just four months ago – the president told voters, “Democrats want to raid Medicare to find socialism. It won’t last long. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it.”","['invariably', 'tax', 'giveaways', 'massive']"

And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.

"The leader of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been groomed by the right-wing, xenophobic and Islamophobic Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) along with its polticial arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/hindu-fascism-an-all-american-threat/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,53.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Like all cities with large Indian diasporas, Chicago has Devon Avenue where purveyors of Indian clothing, food, and wares congregate. Chicago’s obsession with honorary street signs gives away the sectarian divisions that fester both here and “back home.” The signs “Gandhi Marg” and “Mohammed Ali Jinnah Way,” referring to the revolutionary leaders during India’s independence from Britain, one Hindu and one Muslim, echo the religious split stoked by the British persists to this day. Now, a homegrown movement has taken up the mantle in an insidious and deadly way that threatens U.S. democracy as well.
The leader of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been groomed by the right-wing, xenophobic and Islamophobic Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) along with its polticial arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While known as the world’s largest democracy and founded as a secular one per its constitution, India with a large Hindu majority has re-elected him, a well-documented fascist aligned with a group that destroyed a 16th century mosque and sanctioned mass killings of Muslims in the state of Gujarat. The former Chief Minister of Gujarat and now Prime Minister Modi joined the RSS in his youth (like Brett Kavanaugh joining the Federalist Society) and oversaw the Gujarat massacre. (For a deep-dive into Indian political history, refer to this overview by Arundhati Roy in The Nation.)
We, as Muslim and Hindu women of color, have watched in horror as both the country of our ancestors, India, and the country of our birth, the United States, have devolved into nationalism and fascism. As activists and political candidates, we expected resistance to our political work from outside and within our own communities because we have challenged the status quo that many Indians willingly capitulate to in their eagerness to live up to the white-supremacist model minority stereotype. Sameena ran against an incumbent for Congress, while Arti was elected as the only woman of color on her local Village Board. While we differ in our religious beliefs, we share a commitment to progressivism, anti-racism, anti-casteism, and secularism. We have been disappointed that a vocal upper caste Indian American minority has operated with a “business as usual” attitude, attempted to silence us, or, even worse, aided the expansion of the RSS/BJP ideology within America.
Unfortunately, this expansion has boosted the fortunes of Trump and the Republican Party. Right-wing Hindu Americans took center stage when the Republic Hindu Coalition held a rally for Trump in October 2016 in New Jersey. A Facebook graphic (insert) from the Overseas Friends of the BJP boasts of its reach into 30 U.S. cities along with millions of calls to Indian-American voters, a mobilization that will likely ramp up in 2020 to boost Trump’s re-election chances.
The RSS/BJP collaboration has been a bipartisan effort. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi has built up his reputation as a Trump critic on the House Oversight Committee for the U.S. press and a champion for religious freedom, while cultivating a base of support with Hindu nationalists that actively wish to suppress religious minorities in India and the U.S. Progressive Hindu and Muslim activists wrote an open letter urging Raja, as he directs people to call him, to cancel his appearance at the World Hindu Congress convening in Lombard, Illinois last year and chastising him for past efforts to advance their fascist agenda. The event, organized by the RSS, drew protestors who ended up being assaulted by attendees and called “dirty Muslims.”
Raja’s office not only failed to issue an apology for these hate crimes, but then he attended Modi’s joint rally with Trump this past September in Houston. Billed as “Howdy Modi,” with an audience of over 50,000 Indian Americans, Raja embraced Modi, who later held hands with Trump at the same event. Trump and Modi have both issued Muslim bans, Trump by executive order and Modi with the aid of his BJP-controlled Parliament passed the Citizenship Amendment Act.
As first-generation Indian American activists, we are dismayed by the lack of outrage from our fellow South Asians, Hindus and Muslims when we have called out the “open secret” of Modi-supporting U.S. based Democrats and voiced our opposition to Modi. As the world rages in protests against fascist dictators, we urge conscientious South Asians, Democrats, and progressives to call out and challenge elected officials like Raja who support dictatorial regimes.
Modi’s actions, coupled with his imposition of martial law in Muslim-majority Kashmir and now with the Citizenship Amendmen Act, have drawn massive global protests, reported to be in the hundreds of millions. To show our solidarity with anti-Hindu fascists in India, an interfaith intergenerational coalition across castes and classes, we have joined Equality Labs’ national day of action on Sunday, January 19th, with the Chicago protest taking place on Devon Avenue.
We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put a check on fascism and authoritarianism by protesting Modi and defeating Trump in 2020.

Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action.,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-climate-change-philanthropy-has-quite-few-hidden-strings-ncna1143791?cid=public-rss_20200228,msnbc,middle-class,left,53.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Feb. 17, Amazon CEO and occasional richest-man-in-the-world Jeff Bezos announced he was committing $10 billion — 7 to 8 percent of his massive fortune — to an initiative to combat climate change, dubbed the Bezos Earth Fund. Exactly how the funds will be distributed remains to be seen, but Bezos claims money will start flowing this summer in the form of grants to scientists, activists and nonprofit groups for ""any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world."" It's quite a reversal for the billionaire, who once declared, ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.""
Bezos' change of heart aligns him with other powerful people. Last year, former Republican New York mayor and current candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Mike Bloomberg pledged $500 million to shut down coal plants across the United States. Goldman Sachs, the reviled investment bank, said it will invest $750 billion in ""sustainable finance projects"" over 10 years. And earlier this month, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has around $47 billion in its ever-growing endowment, added climate change to its philanthropic priorities.
It might seem that having wealthy individuals and multinational corporations promising so much money for climate initiatives would be a good thing. But it's much more complicated than just rich people trying to make the planet a better place. Anand Giridharadas, author of ""Winner Takes All,"" has emerged as one of the chief critics of this recent spate of billionaire philanthropy. Giridharadas writes that for all their talk of changing the world through charitable giving, what elites offer is a ""fake change"" that seeks ""to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix — and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.""

In practice, that means it's hard to trust Bezos' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal. Its push for ever-faster delivery times, as little as one to two days in parts of the country, also comes with an environmental cost.
Then there's the bigger question of why philanthropists are suddenly focusing on the environment. Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action. In the United States, President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, rolled back plenty of environmental regulations and opened Alaska's wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, among other backward measures, but even officials at the lower levels of government aren't doing enough.
Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors is that government has failed to take bold action.
But U.S. officials are far from the only offenders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got some good press for implementing a carbon tax, but his government isn't on track to meet its Paris targets, either. Canada also nationalized a pipeline that would increase emissions and facilitate an expansion of Alberta's oil sands, and it is still dealing with crippling rail blockades after federal police forced indigenous land defenders out of the way of yet another pipeline. Meanwhile, politicians in Australia's right-wing government continue to oppose climate action, even in the face of record fires, and the European Union is funding new gas projects despite declaring a climate emergency.
But this lack of vision is not inherent to the public sphere. Rather, Giridharadas argues, it's the product of a broken system captured by notions of ""business fundamentalism"" and ""market worship,"" in which even those in the public sector believe that the capitalist class must chart the path forward. This is largely the product of a mindset promoted by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and brought into the Democratic Party by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which devalues the role of government in favor of the private sector.
In 2019, the 500 richest people in the world increased their wealth by $1.2 trillion, an increase of 25 percent in a single year. Also relevant: The richest 10 percent of people worldwide are responsible for nearly half of global emissions. Yet the tax rate paid by American billionaires fell below that of the working class in 2018 — and all their philanthropy actually reduces the tax they pay. Amazon, one of the most valuable companies in the world, paid no federal tax in 2018, instead receiving a $129 million tax refund.
That transfer of wealth has limited the ability of government to respond to social problems while increasing the economic power of billionaires. To some, that may seem like a good thing — we've been told for decades that the private sector is more efficient. But as Giridharadas says: ""There is enormous moral difference between five guys deciding to do something and a city deciding to do something. This is something I think you wouldn't have had to explain to people 100 years or 200 years ago when we actually had more faith in the idea of democratic action."" By leaving so much to billionaires, democracy is eroded.
The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations. In the past, large-scale social and economic transformations have always required government action, whether it was $500 billion to build the Interstate highway system, the creation of the Federal Housing Authority to subsidize homeownership and the suburbanization of the country or, as Sen. Bernie Sanders talked about recently at CNN's Nevada town hall, the restructuring of the U.S. economy to defeat fascism in World War II. These kinds of massive structural changes could not be accomplished by the private sector alone; Bezos' $10 billion wouldn't even cover the cost of New York City's Second Avenue Subway line, let alone a large-scale transformation of the entire country.
This is because, as Giridharadas writes, ""changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up."" That something is the power and wealth billionaires have derived from an economy that privileges growth at all costs and has caused inequality to soar and accelerated the climate crisis. But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society. They profit from the world as it is, not as it could be.
That's why billionaires' donations will never be enough. The highways, the suburbs and the victory against the Nazis — just to provide a few examples — are products not of the private sector but of government action. Through state spending, regulatory powers and the tax code, the government set the framework and priorities that businesses then responded to — and if we have any hope of cutting emissions in half by 2030, as the scientists tell us we need to do, we'll need the government to use its power to reset the rules once again.
The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place. For that, we need the government to redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, change the tax code to penalize unsustainable industries, alter regulations to encourage denser development and ultimately set a framework that's more favorable to workers and communities that have been left behind these past few decades. That's why, regardless of what billionaires do, we need a Green New Deal to chart the path forward.","['swoop', 'saviors', 'failed']"
A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/follow-the-money-gop-senators-are-making-millions-off-trumps-tax-cuts-and-will-repay-him-by-betraying-their-oath/,alternet,middle-class,left,54.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"It’s long been obvious that Republican senators have little interest in serving as impartial jurors in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. While there is a raft of motivations for such historic perfidy — with several GOP senators politically benefiting from some of the same corrupting influences — one under-examined, non-Russian reason is personal greed.
A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. According to a Center for Public Integrity analysis, several Republican members of Congress directly cashed in on the multibillion-dollar windfall from the corporate tax cuts the GOP pushed through on a party-line vote. With the lowest effective tax rate in the last 40 years, America’s largest corporations proceeded to pour $1 trillion not into increased wages for workers but buybacks of their own stocks, causing stock prices to soar. Coincidentally, many Republican lawmakers who voted for the largest tax cut signed into law by Trump personally owned some of the same stocks whose values significantly increased as a result.
At least seven Republican senators owned stocks in companies that spent billions on buybacks, resulting in great personal profit, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The report came on the same day that former New York Rep. Chris Collins, who was the first sitting GOP congressman to support Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading.
It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate. With that, Trump’s fate in a Senate impeachment trial was all but sealed.
While the report is a less than shocking look into the kleptocratic ways of the modern GOP, it shows that the transactional core of the 2017 tax cuts has ramifications far beyond the $1.8 trillion increase in the national debt. Republican senators in purple states, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and David Perdue of Georgia, have personally reaped hundreds of millions from the tax law and are repaying the president by serving as his impeachment propaganda machine rather than impartial jurors — even as half of registered voters and a majority of independents in a Fox News poll released on Sunday said the Senate should convict Trump.
Now, in addition to running defense for Trump, McConnell’s repeating Trump’s empty promises of a middle-class tax cut in an election year.
“We’re talking a fairly substantial … middle-class tax cut that’ll be subject to taking back the House and obviously keeping the Senate and keeping the White House,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. He promised a plan would be revealed in 90 days.
Before the 2018 midterms, Trump actually admitted that his tax bill was never aimed at cutting middle-class taxes, promising to actually deliver in 2019. “We’re putting in a resolution some time in the next week and a half to two weeks [and] we’re giving a middle-income tax reduction of about 10 percent,” Trump told reporters at the time.
The first Republican rule of “middle-class tax cuts” is to speak about them but never actually pass them. They’ve been pulling the same bait-and-switch since at least 1980. But while they were cutting taxes for the rich and corporations, the GOP left in place the income taxes a majority of seniors pay on their Social Security income. Now they are again touting cuts to Medicare and Social Security to cover the payoff they gave to themselves.
“The president directed me to produce what we’re calling tax cuts 2.0,” senior White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow explained last week. “It will be published sometime during the campaign, as a message for future Trump economic growth policies, [with] particular emphasis on the middle class, in his second term. … We are looking at a variety of tax cuts, sometimes making permanent some existing tax cuts, some existing corporate tax cuts.”
That last part gives the game away. The promise of continued corporate tax cuts is how Trump builds his 2020 election war chest from the super-rich and buys the continued allegiance of Republican impeachment jurors, even in the face of ever more damning evidence of his public corruption.

Rozdilsky, York University, Canada and Heriberto Urby, Jr., Western Illinois University
In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, American cities are coping with strife and civil unrest comparable to 1968.
In an apparent attempt to divert attention from a lacklustre White House effort to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and a tone-deaf approach to racial injustice, President Donald Trump has entered into another of his many quagmires where he seems to have spoken first and contemplated later.
Despite Trump’s specious symbolic display involving clearing a park of protesters to pose to take photos in front of an empty church, the president’s words at his June 1 news conference were consequential.
He specifically named the Insurrection Act of 1807 as a possible remedy to the current crisis. Surprisingly, due to that obscure act, Trump may indeed have the power to send federal troops into states without a request from the governor, even as the Pentagon tries to distance itself from the threat.
Using military force domestically
In times of disaster, active-duty military troops can be ordered to perform actions to protect life, property and maintain order. In terms of U.S. federal legislation enabling the government to take action to respond to disaster, the Stafford Act authorizes the use of the military for disaster relief. In such cases, a state’s governor must make a request for the military to provide very specific support roles for disaster relief efforts.
However, in the American constitutional republic, there are direct limits on the support roles that the military can play in times of crisis.
Restrictions on the participation of the military in domestic law enforcement are interpreted through the Posse Comitatus Act. It’s been in force since 1878, when it was enacted as part of a backlash against the imposition of federal martial law in the former Confederate States during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era.
There are four statutory exceptions when the military can act in a domestic law enforcement capacity, in direct contradiction to the Posse Comitatus Act.
Three of the exceptions are based on enabling responses to contemporary threats to the United States, when only the federal government would be capable of mustering the resources necessary to respond to serious national security crises of grave concern.
Those situations pertain to fighting drug and transnational organized crime activities, assistance in the case of crimes involving nuclear material and emergency situations involving the use of weapons of mass destruction.
The Insurrection Act
The fourth exception is the Insurrection Act, which has had very little alteration since it was enacted on March 3, 1807.
The act permits the federal deployment of military force into the states to suppress insurrections and enforce federal law in three circumstances. These circumstances are clearly defined by the legislation.
Federal aid to state governments is the first circumstance that allows for federal military intervention to suppress an insurrection in a state, upon the request of that state’s governor or legislature.
During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, for example, President George H.W. Bush deployed federal troops at the request of the California governor to quell civil uprisings in south-central L.A.
Another section of the act, entitled “Use of Militia and Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority” permits the president, on his own initiative, to suppress rebellion or enforce federal laws. If the president believes that …
“Unlawful obstructions, combinations, assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any States by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings …”
… then armed forces of the federal government can be deployed to the states.
The origins for the domestic use of troops are found in the Calling Forth Act of 1792, which allowed for President George Washington to send federal to troops to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion despite disagreements with the governor of Pennsylvania.
The Calling Forth Act was extended into the 1807 Insurrection Act as the militia acts of the 1790s that first delegated sweeping emergency powers to the president expired.
A section of the Insurrection Act entitled “Interference with States and Federal Law” allows for the president to take any measures necessary to suppress, in a state, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination or conspiracy.
The 1957 deployment of federal troops by President Dwight Eisenhower to enforce school desegregation orders in Little Rock, Ark., was an example of the use of that provision.
A divider-in-chief
While Trump has stopped short of invoking the 1807 act to use the military to enforce laws domestically, he’s kept the option open, fomenting further unrest and division.
Rather than staging photo opportunities while awkwardly holding a Bible in Lafayette Square, Trump would have issued a formal proclamation calling on the insurgents to disperse if he’s serious about the application of the Insurrection Act.
Section 334 of the Insurrection Act states:
“Whenever the President considers it necessary to use the militia or the armed forces under this chapter, he shall, by proclamation, immediately order the insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their abodes within a limited time.”
In the event that Trump issues a formal proclamation to disperse, we can then assume that he and his legal team are going down the path of sending federal military forces to the states, with or without the request or permission of governors.
Words we have heard and actions we have witnessed are not those of a commander-in-chief, but a divider who is ill-informed about the appropriate methods and uses of emergency powers available to the executive branch. We dare not believe that the Insurrection Act of 1807 was intended to be a national call to war against the American people.

"He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,54.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump’s racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are “originally” from somewhere else and should therefore “go back” — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.
Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it’s a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.
As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump “believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.”
There’s good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, “Trump’s popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,” and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.
So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.
For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Such “birther” theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be “real” Americans.
Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.
Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. “Replacement theory” — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and “replaced” by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that’s become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are “invading the country” and can never be “fully American,” and that demographic changes from immigration are “more change than human beings are designed to digest” and inherently a threat to “your neighborhood.”
The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be “tipping over a cliff.”
This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['justified', 'rave']"
"While, in the wake of the El Paso murders, the media and most of our politicians are acting shocked—“shocked, I tell you!”—that there are armed racists in America who are trying to terrify people of color, the reality is that it’s pretty much always been that way here in the United States.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/the-latest-massacre-shows-the-dark-purpose-behind-second-amendment-is-still-being-fulfilled/,alternet,gun-control,left,54.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"While, in the wake of the El Paso murders, the media and most of our politicians are acting shocked—“shocked, I tell you!”—that there are armed racists in America who are trying to terrify people of color, the reality is that it’s pretty much always been that way here in the United States. And until white Americans and the media they control acknowledge that simple history, we won’t be able to do the things we must to change it.
While we need rational gun control, this isn’t a gun control issue.
While we need economic security to be more widely shared, this isn’t an economic issue.
While we need universal, free, high-quality K-PhD education, this isn’t an education issue.
While the Republican Party needs to repudiate the “Southern Strategy” that has animated their racist base since 1968, this isn’t a political issue.
Encompassing all of the above, what we are confronting in America right now is the continuation of policies put into place by white people, to control and exploit Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, since the arrival of Africans in 1619 and the codification of slavery into North American law in 1662.
The institution of slavery can only exist in a police state. Without a constantly vigilant and well-armed force of men (and the rare, occasional woman) patrolling the towns and roads, slaves will rebel and put an end to their own enslavement.
As Sally Hadden notes in her brilliant book Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas, slaveholding regions had institutionalized police-patrol systems specifically to “regulate” enslaved persons more than 100 years before American independence.
In Georgia, for example, a generation before the American Revolution, the colonial government passed laws in 1755 and 1757 that required all plantation owners or their white male employees to be members of the Georgia militia and those armed militia members to make monthly inspections of the quarters of all slaves in the state. The law defined which counties had which armed militias and even required armed militia members to keep a keen eye out for slaves who might be planning uprisings.
As Carl T. Bogus wrote for the University of California Davis Law Review in 1998, “The Georgia statutes required patrols, under the direction of commissioned militia officers, to examine every plantation each month and authorized them to search ‘all Negro Houses for offensive Weapons and Ammunition’ and to apprehend and give twenty lashes to any slave found outside plantation grounds.”
James Madison even rewrote the Second Amendment into its current form during the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention in response to that state’s largest slaveholder, Patrick Henry, demanding that Virginia’s slave patrols be explicitly protected.
While slavery as an institution was abolished after the Civil War by the 13th Amendment (“except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted”), the organized and systematic domination of people of color for the benefit of whites continues to this day. And the enforcers of that system—both formal and informal—are still very much with us.
State prisons legally enslaving “duly convicted” persons of color; Klan riders and lynching “parties”; cops killing black men for selling loose cigarettes or murdering black children for playing with toy guns; mass shooters raving about “invasion” by Hispanics; white men enforcing segregation by killing black men and boys who look at or date white women: These are the modern incarnations of the old slave patrols that most Americans recognize.
Less easily recognized is the patrolling of America’s economic racial divide, from Trump employees marking “C” for “colored” on rental applications so people of color could be denied residence, to the rigorous application of property tax funding for schools to keep poor districts poor, millions of individual corporate actions and thousands of state and local laws still conspire to “patrol” people of color.
Like his presidential hero Andrew Jackson (nickname: “Indian Killer”), who owned enslaved people and bragged about murdering Native American women and children, Donald Trump speaks to an exclusively white audience, in this era via Twitter and a TV network that, judging from the ratings, programs exclusively to white people.
From “very fine people” who are literally Nazis and white supremacists, to “I’ll pay for your lawyer” calls for violence, to barely speaking in code with words like “invasion” and “infestation,” Trump has cranked up a new generation of white men who, in previous centuries on this continent, would have been enthusiastic members of the police state that protected slavery from rebellion.
The slave patrols never really went away. And the slave patrollers are finding in Trump the president they’ve been missing since Andrew Jackson passed away.

"It’s paramount now, as Fox News and the right-wing noise machine try to take down a new generation of Democratic women leaders, that everyone understands the strategy in play.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/fox-news-is-doing-to-ilhan-omar-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-exactly-what-it-did-to-hillary-clinton/,alternet,gender,left,55.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"For decades, Fox News’ programming has revolved around the need to identify and target Democratic demons, who are then used to frighten Republican viewers. And for most of the network’s existence, Hillary Clinton has served as a perennial rogue, depicted as a villainous, criminal scoundrel who can’t be trusted with America’s future. With Clinton now receding from public life, Fox News has seamlessly transferred its vile attacks onto a new generation of Democratic women, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
“Fox News needs an opponent, a detractor, an enemy to add conflict and edge to its broadcasts,” noted the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple. In other words, Fox is in the business of scripted entertainment—under the guise of “news”—and needs long-running characters that it can return to again and again. It crafts targets of hate who rile up viewers and keep them tuned in to the different storylines.
For Fox, Clinton, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez represent perfect targets in terms of riling up its intolerant base: Clinton is a woman of a certain age, while Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are women of a certain heritage. And yes, there’s something in the Fox News DNA over the years that has meant that women political opponents spark a deeper sense of outrage and hate. You could make an argument that during eight years in the White House, it was Michelle Obama who suffered sharper, more personal Fox News attacks than did her husband. It’s all part of an endless, dehumanizing campaign to silence opponents, and specifically to silence and intimidate Democratic women.
This week, Fox News’ sister print outlet, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, published an incitement on the front page, which depicted the World Trade Towers bursting into flames and falsely claimed that Omar, who is Muslim, had belittled the Sept. 11 attack. The reckless pile-on has been relentless. Days earlier, Fox & Friendshost Brian Kilmeade questioned Omar’s loyalty, saying, “You have to wonder if she is an American first.” Over at Fox Business News, Lou Dobbs claimed, “She sounds like she hates America.” Those comments echoed those made by another Fox host, Jeanine Pirro, who suggested, “Omar wears a hijab. … Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?”
Pirro was actually suspended from hosting her Saturday night show for two weeks because of her tawdry attack on Omar. But her suspension has obviously done nothing to curtail the mindless, racist attacks on the Democratic congresswoman. All this has happened while threats against Omar’s life continue to escalate.
To date, Fox News’ obsession with Ocasio-Cortez, for the most part, hasn’t been as overtly dangerous as its smear campaign against Omar, but the negative attention has been unending.","['noise', 'machine']"

"AOC, like all powerful women, has to go through a rigorous beauty regimen simply to exist in the public eye.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/the-real-scandal-behind-aocs-haircut/,alternet,gender,left,55.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Hair toss, check my nails.” So begins Lizzo’s blockbuster song “Good as Hell,” which sells a dizzying idea of female empowerment. With its iconic rhythm and feel-good sentiment, “Good as Hell” has had tremendous success resonating with young girls, sorority sisters, and dance club frequenters, to even middle-aged white moms like me. But on Thursday, I heard the song scratch to a halt in the back of my mind upon reading a Washington Times story by Alex Swoyer entitled “EXCLUSIVE: Self-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.”
In her piece, Ms. Swoyer seeks to shine a light on the purported hypocrisy of a congresswoman who declares herself a socialist but spends hundreds of dollars on her hair. But in her rush for snarky liberal-bashing, Swoyer misses the real story about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s pricey haircut: the blatant and disparate “female tax” that women in power must pay to achieve and maintain their power.
Swoyer calculates that, in a Washington, D.C. hair salon, AOC likely spent, with gratuity, more than $300 to get her hair cut and colored. The math looks correct. (I say that as someone who got her hair cut and colored in D.C. Thursday for a similarly outrageous amount of money in a different hair salon.) Swoyer suggests that AOC could have spent a mere $100 for the “same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop” where men’s cuts cost about $20.
And that is where Swoyer misses the real story. AOC, like all powerful women, has to go through a rigorous beauty regimen simply to exist in the public eye. Picture Laura Ingraham, Kellyanne Conway, Andrea Mitchell, Nicole Wallace, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, Dana Bash, Susan Collins, and Jeanine Pirro.
The beauty routine for prominent women who work and live under the eye of a camera can include not just haircuts, but hair color, highlights, lowlights, Keratin treatments, blowouts, braids, manicures, pedicures, facials, eyebrow waxes, eyelash extensions. In some cases, it may include Botox and plastic surgery. Not to mention, women operating in the public eye often maintain one to two sets of makeup (one for home and one for the office) which consists of products like foundation, mascara, lipstick, all the brushes and utensils to apply makeup with, and much more. These costs add up to hundreds, in some cases thousands, of dollars a year.
On top of the enormous financial impact, these beauty regimens require these women to take the time out of their busy schedules to attend to their appearances in a way that men in power are spared. Women in power must pay a significant tax on their limited time to sit for manicures, blowouts, brow waxes, and braids, rather than meeting with constituents, reviewing legislation, conducting investigations, chasing a story, traveling to their districts, reviewing their notes, or spending time with their families.
The story about AOC’s haircut is the story about how women continue to face enormous—and often superficially imposed—obstacles to achieving power and influence. Women in power must be more than mentally prepared for work, knowledgeable of the issues, ready to defend themselves and their work on a moment’s notice, and braced to fend off sexism and harassment.
Twenty-dollar barbershop haircuts, a shower, and a shave simply won’t suffice—nor will a mere hair toss and checking your nails. That’s a very real cost for women in powerful positions. It is not, as Lizzo might say, “good as hell.” And that is the scandal behind haircut-gate.

"Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed uncluding a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.",https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/593581096/0/alternet_all~Alexandria-OcasioCortez-is-absolutely-right-%e2%80%94-there-shouldn%e2%80%99t-be-any-billionaires/,alternet,middle-class,left,55.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to harness the news cycle hasn’t died down one bit now that the newly-elected New York congresswoman has settled into office. Most of the AOC coverage over the past week continues to be TMZ-ified, focusing on Aaron Sorkin’s stuffed-shirt scolding of younger members of Congress and exaggerating Ocasio-Cortez’s supposed conflict with other Democrats.
The congressional freshman from the Bronx continues to calmly and unapologetically use her fame for good, however. She used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.
On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez attended a symposium where author Ta-Nehisi Coates asked her if it was moral to have “a world that allows for billionaires.” Ocasio-Cortez swiftly said it was not. She hastened to note that individual billionaires, such as Bill Gates, may well be good people. But “a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.”
AOC continued to hammer this point home later the same night on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, explaining (yet again) that her proposed 70 percent marginal income tax rate would only be on money made above the first $10 million a year — and that a similar marginal tax rate reached 90% when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
“Do we want to live in a city where billionaires have their own personal Uber helipads,” she asked, “in the same city and same society as people who are working 80-hour weeks and can’t feed their kids?”
Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.
On his own, the barely literate imbecile with no redeeming qualities who sits in the Oval Office claiming to be a billionaire (even if he probably isn’t) creates a one-man argument against the premise that wealth flows from merit. But the numbers increasingly back up Ocasio-Cortez’s argument that our system unjustly concentrating massive amounts of wealth in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of society with little to show for all their hard work and social contributions.
On Monday, Oxfam published a report showing that a mere 26 individual billionaires now have as much wealth between them as the least wealthy half of the human population. Which is to say, these 26 people have more money combined than 3.8 billion of the world’s population.
The idea that those 26 people are somehow being fairly rewarded by that massively unequal equation defies all common sense, especially as most billionaires have built their wealth on the labor of people who only take home a fraction of the value they add to the companies they work for.
It’s not just a matter of sour grapes. The billionaires saw their wealth rise by 12 percent in one year — the same year that saw the poorest half of the population lose 11 percent of their wealth, a loss that people who are already struggling to afford food, shelter and basic necessities simply cannot tolerate.
It’s not just that there seems to be a direct correlation between how much money the rich make and how little everyone else gets. There’s also evidence that vast inequalities stifle economic growth, and that redistribution of the sort that Ocasio-Cortez proposes can kickstart the economy. Money in the hands of working people is spent, and stimulates the economy, much more than money being hoarded by the wealthy few, after all. Inequality also breeds crime and other forms of social instability.
But mostly, this is a moral issue, and one of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarkable gifts as a communicator is her ability to speak about this issue in moral terms. Most people, of all wealth and income levels are hard workers. The fact that only a select few are amply rewarded while most others go wanting is both unfair and immoral. And the worse the problem gets, the more unavoidable this unfairness becomes.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. This includes a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.
The problem conservatives must face is that the very inequality they are defending is a rhetorical obstacle in itself. Most people recognize that it’s unfair that rich people make so much more money than the rest of us, and does not necessarily prove they have worked harder. Getting people to sign off on the idea that they simply are less worthy than their wealthier fellow citizens is not an easy lift, which is why Republicans prefer to stick to culture-war distractions, like fear-mongering over immigration or abortion.
Since Ocasio-Cortez first mentioned the 70 percent tax rate on CNN, a number of mansplaining journalists have written harrumphing pieces explaining that the “real” problem is tax loopholes or capital-gains tax rates set too low. This approach fails to understand the nature and purpose of Ocasio-Cortez’s political rhetoric. Any tax plan that raised marginal rates that high would almost certainly have other provisions to close loopholes or tax investments more fairly. But before we can get to that point, there must be more political momentum to change the tax system.
By focusing on marginal tax rates — which are easier to explain to the general public than most other taxation strategies — Ocasio-Cortez can help build a moral and social argument against economic inequality. Blunt statements, like saying that it’s immoral that billionaires exist at all, can help people reimagine a world where resources are distributed more equitably and ordinary people who work hard and drive economic growth can see their effort reflected in their paychecks.
Because the truth of the matter is that she’s right: We shouldn’t have billionaires. Any system that has a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals, by definition, is not rewarding hard work and social contributions fairly, or anywhere close to it. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that. But the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. Most people know that’s true, whatever their official “politics” may be, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny it.",['demonize']
"After all, who else are they going to find who would be willing to just openly gaslight members of Congress, telling them not to believe the evidence of the dead in Pittsburgh and Christchurch and El Paso and many other mass-killing sites, by wielding her blackness like a shield?",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/why-do-republicans-keep-inviting-candace-owens-to-testify-on-white-nationalism/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,55.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In an age when media stardom apparently confers some kind of universal expertise, it’s probably not a complete surprise that Republican House leaders keep trotting out pundit/provocateur Candace Owens to testify in congressional hearings on what should be a matter requiring the utmost seriousness and gravity: white nationalist terrorism and its toll on the American social fabric.
After all, who else are they going to find who would be willing to just openly gaslight members of Congress, telling them not to believe the evidence of the dead in Pittsburgh and Christchurch and El Paso and many other mass-killing sites, by wielding her blackness like a shield? Other than, say, Diamond and Silk or Michelle Malkin, who have about the same amount of experience and expertise regarding domestic terrorism as Owens does—which is to say, none whatsoever.
Last week, it backfired on them.
Owens made another made-for-viral-video appearance last Friday before the House Oversight and Reform subcommittees on national security and civil rights and civil liberties, launching into one of her patented tirades in which she lectured both members of Congress and academic experts who had been called by Democrats to testify. Afterward, she dismissed one of them—the University of Chicago professor Kathleen Belew, who has published multiple peer-reviewed works on the issue—as a “made-up professor.”
“White supremacy is indeed real, but despite the media’s obsessive coverage of it, it represents an isolated, uncoordinated and fringe occurrence within America,” Owens told the committee.
Unfortunately for Owens, the Department of Homeland Security that very morning published its findings that white nationalist terrorism was a major national security threat that warranted the full attention of all components of American law enforcement: “The continuing menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to our nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population, and the core values of both our society and our department,” said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in a Brookings Institute speech.
﻿
Owens, however, was undaunted.
“You know that white supremacy and white nationalism ranks nowhere near the top issues that are facing black America,” she added. “And the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is an attempt to make the election all about race, as Democrats do.”
The performance was essentially a reprise of her earlier testimony in April before the House Judiciary Committee, when Owens insisted similarly that “white supremacy, racism, white nationalism, words that once held real meaning, have now become nothing more than election strategies. Every four years, the black community is offered handouts and fear. Handouts and fear. Reparations and white nationalism. This is the Democrats’ preview.”
Her claims echo the whitewashing job attempted by Tucker Carlson around the earlier House hearings, as well as his more recent claims that “white nationalism is a hoax.” As with Carlson’s soft-pedaled version of things, Owens’ insistence that the threat of far-right white terrorism doesn’t matter to the black community doesn’t meet the reality smell test.
Owens defended herself Friday by insisting that her blackness was credential enough to claim expertise in domestic terrorism. “This hearing is a farce,” she said. “It is ironic that you’re having three Caucasian people testify and tell you what their expertise are. Do you want to know what my expertise are? Black in America. I’ve been black in America my whole life, all 30 years, and I can tell you guys have done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle, and it needs to stop.”
As committee Chair Jamie Raskin pointed out at the time, “[T]he title of our hearing is ‘Confronting Violent White Supremacy: Addressing the Transnational Terrorist Threat’”—that is, it was an attempt to consider the global reach of the white nationalist movement. It was only incidentally about the impact of white nationalism on the black community.
Belew sharply contradicted Owens’ testimony. “Well, we have a history of treating it like it doesn’t matter, and the result of that has been death and destruction and the disruption of all kinds of people’s lives,” she observed. As for the lack of numbers, she explained, one only need look at the history of civilian surveillance in the U.S.:
From the outset, surveillance in the United States has been a profoundly political project. So we can go all the way back to the 1960s and think about how things like the FBI Counterintelligence Program were unequally targeted. COINTELPRO, people in this room might know, was a project that sought to disrupt fringe activism on both the left and on the right. But we know from the history that it was profoundly more focused on the left and on activists of color than on the right. So Klan groups were infiltrated, but there were no deaths of Klan activists in this period at the hands of FBI informants, nor was there a cohesive effort to disrupt those groups the way that there was on the left. Similarly, our resources have been overwhelmingly dedicated to confronting Islamic or international terror rather than white or domestic terror. The reason we don’t have these numbers is because there hasn’t been an aggregating data project within the federal government.
The Department of Homeland Security also contradicted Owens, though in a separate setting. “The United States faces an evolving threat environment and a threat of terrorism and targeted violence within our borders that is more diverse than at any time since the 9/11 attacks,” McAleenan said on Friday. “We are acutely aware of the growing threat from enemies, both foreign and domestic, who seek to incite violence in our nation’s youth, disenfranchised, and disaffected, in order to attack their fellow citizens.”","['mass-killing', 'gaslight', 'blackness']"
"President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life.

The kids who managed to wait (despite a plateful of temptation in front of them) turned out to be generally more successful than their more impatient peers. Their grades were better, their SAT scores were higher, they were healthier and socially better-adjusted. The experiment set off an explosion of scholarship on the benefits of delayed gratification, perseverance, and “grit.” It’s one reason “self-mastery” and “self-control” are part of almost every kindergartener’s curriculum today.
America is now facing something like a national Marshmallow Test. Many states are pushing to reopen their economies, even with plentiful evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As summer beckons and restrictions loosen, citizens will have to judge just how far they’ll reach for a taste of pre-pandemic normalcy, whether it’s a trip to the salon, a carefree cookout with friends, or a night out at the theater. More challenging, people will have to maintain the discipline of social distancing until the virus is genuinely under control. It might be tantalizing to forego some of the summer’s most sought-after activities—like a trip to the beach—but the most abstemious countries will have greater rewards down the line. No doubt, those that persevere in taming the virus will claim the prize of lasting economic stability.
President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. Worse than the preschooler who succumbs to a single marshmallow, Trump would stuff his face and then smash the plate.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. Barely two weeks after declaring a national emergency in mid-March, he said he hoped to see “packed churches” by Easter and started urging the return of professional sports with full stadiums. As cases mounted a month later, Trump tweeted to “liberate” three states from lockdown restrictions, encouraging rebellions against governors’ efforts to stop the spread of infection. Then, in late May, as U.S. deaths edged toward the ominous threshold of 100,000, Trump called on churches to hold in-person services, contradicting state bans on mass gatherings, declaring them “essential.”
Consistently, he has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly hasn’t spoken to Trump in two weeks. All of these comments and actions have delayed the day when true normalcy will arrive, if not sabotaged it altogether.
For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.
Public health officials have repeatedly warned against the lifting of restrictions prematurely, especially when many states still lack the testing and contact tracing infrastructure necessary to tamp down inevitable outbreaks. Adding to these worries is the possibility of a new wave, sparked by this week’s mass protests and the gatherings over Memorial Day weekend. The worst-case scenario, scientists say, is a resurgence of the virus this fall in combination with the seasonal flu. The coming months, as ousted vaccine official Rick Bright recently told Congress, could be the “darkest winter in modern history.” Nevertheless, states are vaulting over the federal government’s metrics for a safe reopening in a race to restart their economies. As of June 3, 16 states were reporting a rise in new infections, a number that’s likely to tick upward.
Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Rather than tackle immigration reform, Trump opted for the cheap optics of “building a wall,” a colossal waste of tax-payer money. Rather than negotiate a sensible agreement with China over its unfair trade practices, he levied a series of ill-considered tariffs and set off a trade war that has put U.S.-China relations on its worst footing in decades. And instead of investing in the painstaking work of tamping down COVID-19, he’s scapegoated the World Health Organization and repeatedly touted an anti-malaria drug that doesn’t treat the disease and is now shown to increase the likelihood of death.
The next few months will pose a crucial test of our national resolve and set the country’s trajectory for years to come. Americans need a leader who is honest about the difficulties that lie ahead, undaunted by the scale of the task, and willing to do take on the arduous job of navigating the nation’s recovery. In other words, they need the exact opposite of Trump.
In his speech announcing the moon shot, President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Rebuilding a post-pandemic America will be one of the hardest tasks the nation has ever had to face. Unlike the moon shot, with its aspiration and glamour, the goal will be the simple restoration of a life with some semblance to what we had before.
Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.","['reckless', 'igniting', 'squandered', 'sacrifice']"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
President Donald Trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in Davos on Tuesday to make the case that ordinary Americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration’s “America first” maxim.
At the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, Trump argued that a regime of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class.
“Every decision we make on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday Americans,” Trump said, adding that “the well-being of the American worker” was paramount.
On CNBC, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow echoed the president’s assertions. “Inequality is diminishing right now,” he said. “I think we’re in a better place.”
Many mainstream economists hold a different opinion. While low unemployment and steadily — if slowly — rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower-income Americans, these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few.
“The economic backdrop is such that people’s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement… “It’s debatable what all of that’s attributable to,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha
In spite of higher incomes, significant wealth-building among the middle class has not manifested, McBride pointed out. “More people are working, more people are making money. The extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security, such as boosting emergency savings, retirement savings or paying down debt, is still unclear,” he said.
The Republicans’ corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
“The Tax Policy Center says that two-thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution, with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains,” he said.
“I don’t particularly feel that it’s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape,” said Scott Cole, founder and president of Cole Financial Planning and Wealth Management.
Economists point out that Trump’s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit, a growth-sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing, even as the stock market has notched record highs.
“There’s no way that what’s happening right now under a Republican administration is fiscal conservatism,” Cole said.
In his Davos speech, Trump revisited another favorite topic, negative interest rates. “They get paid to borrow money, something I could get used to very quickly. Love that,” he said.
In reality, negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary Americans, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics.
“We know that they also destroy household savings and long-term retirement security,” she said. “It’s a move that supports stock markets, not personal savings.”
And to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual, a large number of households have still been left behind, McBride said. “We’ve seen scant evidence that Americans, en masse, have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security,” he said.
“Regardless of what the headline is… I would think it’s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you’re not participating in it,” Cole said.",[]
"Gun control groups hit back, saying the closures are strictly a public health matter — even as a number of sympathetic Democratic governors acknowledge bowing to pressure from lawsuits and the Trump administration.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/buckling-pressure-many-states-deem-gun-stores-essential-allow-them-n1177706?cid=public-rss_20200407,msnbc,gun-control,left,56.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"What's considered ""essential?"" Food, prescription drugs, sometimes liquor — and, in most states, firearms.
To slow the spread of the coronavirus, 42 states have issued some form of a stay-at-home order, mandating that nearly all nonessential businesses close. Gun retailers in at least 30 of those states, however, have been allowed to stay open amid pushback from gun groups and the federal government.
Balking at the prospect of shuttered storefronts, gun rights advocates have sued multiple states that did not initially or explicitly deem firearms retailers essential businesses during the pandemic, arguing that a public health crisis is no excuse to trample on anyone's Second Amendment rights. Gun control groups hit back, saying the closures are strictly a public health matter — even as a number of sympathetic Democratic governors acknowledge bowing to pressure from lawsuits and the Trump administration.
""It wouldn’t have been my definition but that is the definition at the federal level, and I didn’t get a vote on that,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said during a recent media briefing announcing that he would reverse a decision not to include guns stores on the state's list of essential businesses.
Murphy, who faced multiple lawsuits from gun groups after his initial order, cited new federal guidance as the reason for declaring gun shops essential.
Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf, also a Democrat, issued an order on March 19 mandating the closure of the physical locations of “all non-life-sustaining business,"" including gun shops.
But Wolf backed down after a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, and a civil rights law firm sued, alleging that he had “overstepped his statutory and constitutional authority” by seeking “to impose criminal and civil penalties upon those” who do not comply. Wolf revised his list to exempt gun stores, allowing them to operate under certain circumstances, including proper social distancing measures. The revised order made clear that gun stores would be exempt from closing because, under state law, gun sales must be made in person.
When California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, ordered all nonessential businesses to close on March 19 as part of his stay-at-home order, the directive caused confusion because it left the decision about gun stores to local officials.
Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, for example, said he would begin closing firearms retailers, while the sheriff of San Diego County said he would not close them because they provide a ""valuable public service.""

Los Angeles’ decision was met with a lawsuit from gun groups, including the National Rifle Association.
The suit, filed in Los Angeles federal court, cited the Second Amendment in arguing that the government may not engage in ""deprivation of constitutional liberties during a time of crisis.” The 30-page filing also argued it was illegal to ""use a public health crisis as political cover to impose bans and restrictions on rights they do not like.""
Villanueva quickly reversed his initial decision after guidance from the top lawyer in Los Angeles County that said the shops could stay open.
Ambiguity over what constitutes an essential business — most states with stay-at-home orders have allowed liquor stores to remain open along with grocery stores and pharmacies, for example — has prompted gun groups to seize on the uncertainty of declaring firearms retailers necessary during a pandemic.
In New York, the NRA sued Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, last week over his March 20 order to not include gun stores as essential businesses that can stay open.
The suit, filed in federal court in New York, accused the governor of having ""indefinitely suspended a key component of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.""
New York officials, the suit said, are “going out of their way to protect liquor stores and release criminals onto the streets, while ignoring the public’s outcry over the suspension of Second Amendment rights,” the suit says. (Under Cuomo’s order, liquor stores were deemed essential businesses. Cuomo also ordered the release of some parole violators from the state’s jails out of fears they could contract coronavirus.)
Cuomo’s office did not respond to questions from NBC News about the suit. The NRA also did not respond to questions from NBC News about the numerous suits it had filed. But Wayne LaPierre, the group’s CEO, said in a statement Friday, “There isn’t a single person who has ever used a gun in self-defense who would consider it nonessential.”
The suit in New York also cited recent guidance from the Trump administration, issued just days earlier, that added workers for ""firearm and ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors and shooting ranges"" to the “essential critical infrastructure workforce.” That guidance, issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a unit within the Department of Homeland Security, however, is “advisory in nature” — “not a federal directive or standard,” according to the agency.
“Individual jurisdictions should add or subtract essential workforce categories based on their own requirements and discretion,” the agency said in a note included with the guidance.
The efforts to keep gun purchases available during the outbreak underscores the extraordinary demand for firearms that the crisis has created.
Firearms sales and federal background checks for purchases soared to all-time highs in March as the coronavirus pandemic brought buyers out in record numbers. The FBI conducted 3.7 million background checks last month, according to its latest figures, the highest total since the national instant check system for buyers was launched in 1998 and 1.1 million higher than the number conducted in March 2019. Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, a consulting firm that tracks the firearms market, said the March queries to the background check system translated to nearly 2.6 million guns sold. And shares in companies that make guns and gun ammunition have risen — even amid a broader plummet in the stock market.
Meanwhile, gun control groups have strongly criticized the decisions to allow gun stores to remain open.
“Instead of listening to the gun lobby's argument that they deserve special treatment during a pandemic that has nothing to do with guns, our leaders should heed the advice of public health experts, who are in the best position to evaluate the risks of virus transmission at gun stores and any other business,” said Hannah Shearer, the litigation director at Giffords, a leading gun-safety group co-founded by shooting victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz.
Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun control advocacy group, pointed to the fact that experts have expressed concerns about domestic violence and mental health problems, including an increased risk of suicide, that the isolation of stay-at-home orders will cause — and made clear that access to guns is likely to exacerbate both issues.
The group also ripped the legal reasoning behind the NRA’s suits, concluding in a legal analysis that the Second Amendment does not require that gun stores be considered essential businesses during a public health crisis.
“As broad laws that apply to thousands of businesses, these closure orders are clearly designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, not undermine anyone’s Second Amendment rights,” Eric Tirschwell, the managing director of the group’s legal arm said in a statement. “The courts have made clear that broad, generally applicable laws like these are constitutional.”",['bowing']
" Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/how-far-will-republicans-go-to-destroy-democracy/#.XSY6699P5zg.twitter,alternet,gun-control,left,56.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Even before the latest Supreme Court decisions approving hyper-partisan gerrymandering and effectively allowing the addition of a citizenship question to the census, experts have wondered aloud whether Republicans remain committed to democracy. Toward the end of a recent plenary panel on Supreme Court reform at the American Constitution Society’s national convention, University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq suggested, “We don’t really know how committed the Republican Party is to the project of democracy.”
If the GOP still values the rule of law, then perhaps the danger to democracy will recede after President Trump leaves office. But if the GOP no longer cares about democracy, then our political system could be in peril. Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate.
Unfortunately, the answer to Huq’s question is clear. The Republican Party is not at all committed to democracy, and GOP leaders and voters would happily tolerate alternative political arrangements. That is a worrisome claim, to be sure, but the evidence is indisputable. Republicans have abandoned any concerns they may have had for the integrity of our political system.
First, as is well understood, the GOP spent the past generation undermining the foundations of democracy — free and fair elections — so as to reinforce white rule. Thanks to the GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box. Due to the Supreme Court’s evisceration of campaign finance law, unlimited and unaccountable dark money floods our politics.
Sophisticated redistricting software enables Republicans to force Democrats to waste millions of votes, leading to highly skewed electoral outcomes. These decades-long assaults required systematically coordinated tactics, such as the 50-year campaign that led to the Supreme Court’s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. The evisceration of democracy is no accident.
Second, the GOP is structurally committed to lying. “Structurally committed” means that party leaders have little if any choice in the matter. They have to lie. And this has nothing to do with Donald Trump. One of the first things that Newt Gingrich’s Republican House majority did upon assuming power in 1995 was to undermine evidence-based policy by killing the Office of Technology Assessment and slashing the funding of the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office.
Why? Republicans must disavow factual evidence because neither wing of the party (the corporate wing or the resentment wing) can tell the truth about what it stands for. The corporate wing cannot admit that it cares exclusively about tax cuts for the rich and corporate deregulation, so it has to lie about what it does. That’s why the 2002 handout to oil, gas and coal companies was called the “Clear Skies Initiative.” That’s why the 2009-2010 health care debate was framed in terms of “death panels,”as if private insurance does not ration care. That’s why the 2017 tax cut for corporations and elites was sold as a middle-class tax cut.
Nor can the resentment wing of the GOP speak honestly about the paranoid basis of its preferences. (Interestingly, Donald Trump occasionally comes close, such as when he refers to Mexicans as “rapists.”) Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they fear black people. “Pro-lifers” cannot admit that they oppose abortion because they are afraid of what would happen if women controlled their bodies. (If they truly supported life, after all, they would fight climate change).
Anti-statists (of the Ruby Ridge or “Oregon standoff” variety) cannot admit that they oppose the public sector because they think government programs are for black people. Xenophobes cannot admit that they oppose immigration because they think brown people are dirty. (How often do you hear them oppose illegal immigration from Canada?) Religious extremists cannot admit that they oppose feminism and LGBTQ people because they are afraid of out-of-control sex. Neither the capitalist nor the resentment wing of the GOP can tell the truth, and that’s why the party is structurally committed to lying. As historian Timothy Snyder has explained, when a political party becomes unmoored from fact, anything is possible.
Third, the GOP has paved the way for the collapse of civilization due to climate change. While it is difficult, psychologically, to confront what’s at stake, some experts have concluded that we have already passed the point at which the collapse of humanity is inevitable, and that civilizational collapse will occur soon. The GOP, of course, has resisted mitigation of the climate crisis for decades. Even the most despicable regimes on earth, such as Syria’s, have signed onto the Paris agreement, but the GOP continues to do everything in its power to obstruct even modest reforms. The collapse of civilization will be worse than genocide, yet the GOP is happy to enable it. If a political party is willing to facilitate an outcome worse than genocide, then why would it oppose authoritarianism? The answer is that it would not.
President Trump, of course, poses an extreme threat to the rule of law. But President Trump is not the root of the problem. Nor is the GOP’s willingness to destroy “democratic norms” the root of the problem. Both Trump and GOP norm-breaking are symptoms, not causes. The root of the Republican radicalism is the triangular relationship among capital (e.g., the Koch brothers), the right-wing media (e.g., Fox News), and resentment voters (whom Hillary Clinton accurately labeled “deplorables”), the latter being the roughly 40 percent of the public who still believe Trump is doing a good job.
Long after Trump leaves the scene, Fox News will continue to manufacture paranoia to motivate resentment voters to vote for capitalists who will head to Washington to lower taxes, deregulate the economy and undermine democracy. The GOP’s capital wing cares about tax cuts and deregulation and, thanks to Fox News, has an unlimited capacity to manufacture paranoia. Its resentment wing cares about making scapegoats suffer, and has an unlimited capacity for consuming paranoia. Neither wing cares about anything else. Not fairness. Not national interest. Not democracy. Not the rule of law. From this perspective, Trump’s presidency is a gift that exposes how the machinery of the GOP works and what’s at stake in its operation.
Many progressives entertain a fantasy that the GOP can be de-radicalized at the ballot box. After all, only 40 percent of the electorate supports Trump. Crooked Media’s Jon Lovett summarized this view before last year’s midterms: “There is only one thing we can do, which is stamp out this form of Republicanism, defeat it completely and govern without them until they learn that there’s a price to be paid for the kind of politics they’ve practiced.”
Unfortunately, however, the GOP cannot be de-radicalized at the ballot box. Democrats already thrashed the GOP in wave elections in 1992, 2006, 2008 and 2018, yet after each election, the Republican Party became even more radical. After its 2012 defeat, the GOP even concluded in a self-administered autopsy that it needed to de-radicalize — and then lined up behind Trump just a few years later.
Even the most mild-mannered Republican, such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine or former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, must govern, once in office, as a radical, no matter how sweet their smile or how gentle their manner. They are just as captured by the triangular relationship between capital, right-wing media and resentment as their more explicitly frothy colleagues. Brett Kavanaugh, after all, hails from the genteel, country club wing of the GOP, yet it took no time at all for him to unveil his radicalism, in both style and substance, at his confirmation hearing.",['survive']
"Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,56.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump’s racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are “originally” from somewhere else and should therefore “go back” — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.
Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it’s a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.
As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump “believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.”
There’s good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, “Trump’s popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,” and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.
So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.
For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Such “birther” theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be “real” Americans.
Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.
Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. “Replacement theory” — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and “replaced” by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that’s become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are “invading the country” and can never be “fully American,” and that demographic changes from immigration are “more change than human beings are designed to digest” and inherently a threat to “your neighborhood.”
The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be “tipping over a cliff.”
This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['severity', 'white', 'nationalist']"
The photograph of Katie Bouman sitting in front of her computer with the first black hole image instantly made her the face of the project — which is why an informal coterie of sexist trolls kicked off a sexist investigation to invalidate her contributions.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/how-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole-turned-into-a-lesson-on-sexism-in-stem/,alternet,gender,left,57.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"This article originally appeared at Salon.
On April 10, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) presented the first-ever direct image of a black hole. The blurry composite embodied over two centuries of advances in mathematics, science and electronics. Prior to the image, only artistic illustrations were available to depict the mysterious singularities that warp the spacetime continuum by virtue of their huge masses, producing such gravitational force that not even light can escape. Shortly after the EHT presentation, MIT tweeted an image of Katie Bouman, a 29-year-old computer scientist whose work was crucial to the project, during the moment the first black hole was processed.
“Here’s the moment when the first black hole image was processed, from the eyes of researcher Katie Bouman,” MIT’s largest research lab, the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab, said on Twitter.
Bouman, a postdoctoral fellow with the Event Horizon Telescope and a forthcoming Assistant Professor in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at the California Institute of Technology, looked ecstatic in the photograph sitting in front of her computer, her hands covering her mouth in awe. The photograph instantly made her the face of the project — which is why an informal coterie of sexist trolls kicked off a sexist investigation to invalidate her contributions.
A familiar story arc followed. Fake Twitter accounts were set up in her name. Men on Twitter dismissed her scientific contributions as mere feminist posturing. And there was a debate over whether or not she was worthy of a Wikipedia page.
It is hard to imagine the same response would have followed if a white man was in that picture instead of Bouman. Salon reached out to Bouman for an interview, but a representative for MIT said she was no longer taking interviews with the press.
It is no secret that women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. According to 2016 statistics, women represent only 30 percent of the STEM workforce. Often their contributions go unnoticed, as history has shown us. For example, when people think about the mission that brought Apollo to the moon they most likely think of astronaut Neil Armstrong, not, say, Margaret Hamilton, who developed the on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. Placing Bouman at the center of the discovery may have been a conscious optics choice for the MIT research lab, given how STEM fields are often criticized for a lack of gender equality, but the public backlash was almost certainly unanticipated.
Amid the chaos, Bouman wrote in a Facebook post: “No one algorithm or person made this image, it required the amazing talent of a team of scientists from around the globe and years of hard work to develop the instrument, data processing, imaging methods, and analysis techniques that were necessary to pull off this seemingly impossible feat. It has been truly an honor, and I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you all.”
Her response was gracious, and emphasized how big scientific projects happen through collective collaboration. As many have pointed out, her response brings to light the false glorification of the “lone genius” trope in STEM, in which one person is responsible for an ingenious creation. (Even Isaac Newton was famously was uncomfortable with the way he was treated as a singular hero for contemplating gravitation; “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” he wrote in a letter to fellow natural philosopher Robert Hooke.) Over 200 people worked on the black hole imaging project, and Bouman bringing this to the attention of the public was not an attempt to deflect her credibility or contributions, but to rather remind people that something this monumental in the science world can’t happen without a lot of brains. As Bouman described in her 2016 TED Talk, she likened herself to a forensic sketch artist, but instead she created an algorithm to image a mystery in the universe.
Yet the worst thing about this entire saga is that it may instill fear in young women who want to pursue a career in STEM. The message from the Bouman backlash is that if you are a woman who becomes the face of a massive scientific breakthrough, sexist internet trolls will spend way too much of their time harassing you and trying to disprove your credibility.
Women often face harassment on various social media platforms — especially in professions like journalism and politics, where they are in the public eye. How we move forward is unclear, as such abusive incidents are apt to inspire many to cease using social media platforms entirely, à la Kelly Marie Tran.","['sexist', 'trolls']"

This dark new event revealed that America’s white nationalism problem goes far beyond Trump,https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/this-dark-new-event-revealed-that-americas-white-nationalism-problem-goes-far-beyond-trump/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,57.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Recently, Republicans have demonstrated a huge amount of concern over the idea that there might be someone in Congress who holds anti-Semitic views. Someone suggesting that Jewish Americans have divided loyalties. And it turns out this concern is very well-founded … as demonstrated ably by Missouri Republican Josh Hawley.
Hawley might be somewhat familiar from his appearances during some recent hearings. Or his claims that Google returns liberal results. Or his statements during the Barr hearing that showed Hawley believes some genuinely bizarre conspiracy theories. But it was Hawley’s keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference that nailed down who he is, what he believes, and where his party is going in a way that should be absolutely terrifying for every American.
Here’s part of that address:
For years the politics of both Left and Right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities. This class lives in the United States, but they identify as ‘citizens of the world.’ They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community. And they subscribe to a set of values held by similar elites in other places: things like the importance of global integration and the danger of national loyalties; the priority of social change over tradition, career over community, and achievement and merit and progress. Call it the cosmopolitan consensus.
Even if you don’t speak white nationalist dog whistle, this speech is pretty shocking. Hawley is claiming that the United States is run, and has been run, by a secret group of international “elites” who value terrible things—such as education, achievement, and progress. People who think women should be able to have a career rather than be forced to stay at home.
But it’s far, far worse if you understand what he’s really saying, and understand the purpose of this convention.
The National Conservatism Conference is new. The meeting held this week in Washington was its inaugural event. It’s described as a movement for a “new vision of conservatism” that focuses on social issues and family values. Which sounds a lot like the old vision of conservatism, except that this one featured Hawley, John Bolton, and Tucker Carlson as the initial speakers, and the discussion mostly involved the horrors of diversity and the unseen hand of globalist elites.
Whichever way you want to put it, the focus of the conference really was on redefining conservatism—redefining it as a very familiar form of nationalism. Trump hasn’t shied away from using the term nationalism; he’s broadcast his fondness for the word. And the National Conservatism Conference was all about that, the merger of conservatism and nationalism into … National Conservatism.
Behind this convention is the Edmund Burke Foundation. Oddly enough, considering what Hawley said in the speech, this foundation definitely has international ambitions, the sort not seen since, say, 1945. Because the purpose of the Edmund Burke Foundation is precisely to marry conservative talking points with nationalism, and to spread that idea around the world, or at least to “Western and democratic” countries, as the group’s very small website makes clear.
At this conference, speakers didn’t come out just against “illegal immigration,” but against immigration in general. Or at least, immigration from the wrong kind of countries. And they spoke out against immigrants. One of them was a University of Pennsylvania law professor who called immigrants “too loud” and blamed them for “an increase in litter.”
That professor, Amy Wax, didn’t bother with any code words. She didn’t feel constrained by any moral qualms. She simply stated that “our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites.”
That’s at a conference keynoted by the newest Republican senator, and attended by members of Trump’s cabinet and pundits from Fox News. And somehow no one, no one seems to be screaming about it. It’s not in the headlines. It’s not causing pundits to drag out their fainting couches.
Now, if you didn’t get it the first time, go back and read Hawley’s speech again, the speech that was chosen to kick off the National Conservatism movement. And understand that every time Hawley says “cosmopolitan,” what he really means is “international Jews.” The use of that term has a long history in anti-Semitism. It’s exactly the term that was used, and the way that it was used, in the Soviet Union to justify the harassment, imprisonment, and murder of Russian Jews: “rootless cosmopolitans” who, according to Stalin, weren’t loyal to their own country, but to “all things foreign.”
It’s not clear how National Conservatism is meant to be abbreviated. Are its members Natcons, or Natcos, or just NatCs? Either way, there’s no doubt about how to pronounce it.","['nationalism', 'dark']"

The New York lawmaker proposed a 70 percent tax on top incomes — a view backed by public opinion and many well-respected economists.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/just-a-cover-for-sexism-and-white-nationalism-paul-krugman-explains-why-the-rights-attacks-on-new-democratic-lawmakers-are-bogus/,alternet,middle-class,left,57.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Right-wing media — and the politicians desperate for its positive coverage — are frothing at the mouth with outrage every time Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex (D-NY) of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) speak a single syllable. Clearly, as others have pointed out, they’re seeking to do to the new freshman class of progressive congresswomen what they’ve done for decades to Hillary Clinton.
The main message conservative talking heads are trying to drive home is simple: Democrats are dangerous extremists, while Republicans are reliable. But as economist Paul Krugman argued in a new column for the New York Times, the exact opposite is the case.
While even the more left-leaning Democrats in Congress have reasonable views in line with public and expert opinion, the right-wing is completely off the deep end.
“Republicans, on the other hand, really are extremists,” wrote Krugman. “As Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it in 2012 — long before the rise of Trump — the modern G.O.P. is ‘ideologically extreme’ and uninterested in ‘facts, evidence, and science.’ For example, major figures in the party routinely dismiss global warming as a hoax perpetrated by a vast global conspiracy.”
Though conservatives try to demonize Ocasio-Cortez an Omar, their actual policy views are perfectly mainstream. The New York lawmaker proposed a 70 percent tax on top incomes — a view backed by public opinion and many well-respected economists. Large majorities of both parties seem to like the Green New Deal, despite efforts by Fox News to paint it as disastrous.
Another instance, not mentioned by Krugman, of congruence between progressive policy and public opinion was inadvertently displayed in Fox News’ town hall Monday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). When the hosts tried to suggest that Sanders’ Medicare for All plan would be unpopular among people who already have insurance by polling the audience, they seemed surprised to find that the people in attendance absolutely cheered the idea of ditching their private plans for government coverage.
Omar has faced some criticized by both parties for remarks that some argued stirred up anti-Semitics stereotypes, but the conservative attacks on her have completely devolved into outrageous bursts of clear Islamophia and slander.
“It’s surely not an accident that these two principal targets are both women of color; there’s a sense in which supposed concerns about extremism are just a cover for sexism and white nationalism,” said Krugman.
And while Democrats continue to push for policies that people actually want and that would make their lives better, President Donald Trump and the Republicans have largely failed in office. Their biggest legislative initiative, tax reform, has added to the public debt, failed to spur business investment, and become unpopular.
On Twitter, Vox’s Matt Ygelsias noted that there is an important exception to Krugman’s point.
“I think it’s important to say that the public has progressive views on economics *except on middle class tax increases* which is an important proviso when you’re designing your agenda,” he said.
This does remain a perpetual challenge for Democrats and anyone hoping to push a more progressive vision for U.S. policy. It may be achievable, and it may make most people much better off, but popular resistance to raising taxes will create difficult frictions whenever major changes are proposed.",['demonize']
"The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,57.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump’s racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are “originally” from somewhere else and should therefore “go back” — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.
Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it’s a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.
As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump “believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.”
There’s good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, “Trump’s popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,” and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.
So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.
For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Such “birther” theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be “real” Americans.
Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.
Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. “Replacement theory” — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and “replaced” by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that’s become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are “invading the country” and can never be “fully American,” and that demographic changes from immigration are “more change than human beings are designed to digest” and inherently a threat to “your neighborhood.”
The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be “tipping over a cliff.”
This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['dirty', 'diseased', 'criminal', 'inherently', 'hypes']"
"Many pointed out at the time of the Park Police’s first statement denying use of “tear gas” was obviously misleading. But Trump and his right-wing defenders jumped on it. Most prominently, Federalist writer Mollie Hemingway wrote a piece, shared by the president, accusing the media of falsely reporting that tear gas was used, even though the crowd was exposed to gases and compounds that clearly caused tears and severe irritation.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-claimed-no-tear-gas-was-used-on-white-house-protesters-now-a-us-official-that-was-based-on-a-mistake/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,58.0,3.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"U.S. Park Police walked back its claim on Friday that no “tear gas” was used to clear protesters in front of the White House before President Donald Trump crossed the street for his ill-fated photo-op on Monday.
The president and his allies had used the claim that there hadn’t been any tear gas used to hit back against critics in the media and elsewhere, who argued it was inappropriate and abusive to clear the street of peaceful protesters. (Trump supporters also argued, with little supportive evidence and extensive reporting to the contrary, that the protest had become violent.)
But Sgt. Eduardo Delgado of the Park Police told Vox on Friday that it was a “mistake” for the department to have previously claimed that tear gas wasn’t used, in addition to the smoke bombs, brute force, and rubber projectiles that struck protesters.
He said that the police used smoke and “pepper balls” to disperse the crowd. Originally, the department had denied using “tear gas,” as many reporters and protesters on the scene had claimed were used based on their first-person experiences.
“The point is we admitted to using what we used,” Delgado told Vox. “I think the term ‘tear gas’ doesn’t even matter anymore. It was a mistake on our part for using ‘tear gas’ because we just assumed people would think CS or CN,” referring to two common types of tear gas.
But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a broad definition of “tear gas,” or “riot control agents,” which it says are “chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.” This includes the pepper balls, which sprays a natural irritant at targets.
Many pointed out at the time of the Park Police’s first statement denying use of “tear gas” was obviously misleading. But Trump and his right-wing defenders jumped on it. Most prominently, Federalist writer Mollie Hemingway wrote a piece, shared by the president, accusing the media of falsely reporting that tear gas was used, even though the crowd was exposed to gases and compounds that clearly caused tears and severe irritation. The Trump campaign put out a statement addressing what it called the “‘tear gas’ lie.”
“I’m not going to say that pepper balls don’t irritate you,” Delgado said in the interview with Vox. “I’m not saying it’s not a tear gas, but I’m just saying we use a pepper ball that shoots a powder.”
Even the specific denial that the form of tear gas known as CS wasn’t used appears to be false. Though all the agencies on the scene in addition to the Park Police, including the Secret Service, denied using CS, a reporting team found used canisters of the substance at the scene of the event shortly after the officers moved through.
But all this is meant to obscure from the plain facts. The federal government used excessive, unnecessary, and violent force to attack and drive out peaceful protesters demonstrating in front of the White House. This was a plain abuse of power, and it demands swift and severe accountability and consequences.","['obviously', 'misleading', 'right-wing']"
"But even if there was a president in the Oval Office who took the issue seriously, there’s still a do-nothing Senate to contend with.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-house-passed-background-check-bill-awaits-gop-action,msnbc,gun-control,left,58.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Even if they wanted to, members of Congress wouldn’t be able to tackle policies to address gun violence anytime soon: lawmakers won’t return from their summer break until early next month. Several Democratic senators, however, spent yesterday urging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to call members back to Capitol Hill.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the Republican leader to end the chamber’s break to vote on a universal background check bill after the two shootings – one in Dayton, Ohio, and another in El Paso, Texas – left at least 29 dead and 53 injured in a matter of just 13 hours. The Senate is currently in recess until September. “One awful event after another. Leader McConnell must call the Senate back for an emergency session to put the House-passed universal background checks legislation on the Senate floor for debate and a vote immediately,” Schumer said in a statement.
I’ll go out on a limb and guess that McConnell will ignore Schumer’s suggestion, though I was glad to see the Democratic Senate leader reference the pending legislation.
It didn’t generate a lot of attention at the time, but it was six months ago when the Democratic-led House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act (H.R. 8) – one of the Dems’ top legislative priorities for this Congress – that would require background checks on all gun purchases, including at gun shows. The final vote was 240 to 190.
It was the first time either chamber of Congress had passed a bill intended to reduce gun violence since 1994 – a quarter of a century ago.
The legislation then went to the Republican-led Senate, where it proceeded to gather dust. Donald Trump, after spending months talking about his support for a background-check bill – a sentiment he seemed to endorse again this morning – issued a veto threat, vowing to reject the proposal if it reached his desk.
But even if there was a president in the Oval Office who took the issue seriously, there’s still a do-nothing Senate to contend with. The New York Times published a report the other day, before the latest mass shootings, on the inactivity in the upper chamber.
Seven months into a new era of divided government, the Republican-led Senate limped out of Washington this week after the fewest legislative debates of any in recent memory. […] The number of Senate roll call votes on amendments – a key indicator of whether lawmakers are engaged in free and open debate – plummeted to only 18 this year, according to a review of congressional data. During the same time period in the 10 previous Congresses, senators took anywhere from 34 to 231 amendment votes. […] [T]he Senate’s legislative record on domestic issues has been so thin that a number of Republicans were left grasping for words when asked to name the chamber’s most significant legislative achievement this year.
Those hoping to see McConnell’s Senate vote on measures to protect Americans from gun violence should probably keep expectations low.",['do-nothing']
"In today’s America, someone with this much money can buy so much advertising and self-promotion that he automatically becomes a Serious Presidential Candidate just by virtue of wanting the job and having the capacity to self-finance a campaign.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/billionaire-howard-schultz-is-no-patriot-robert-reich/,alternet,middle-class,left,58.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"America is the only place in the world where any citizen over the age of 35 can run for president. No experience in government necessary. No support from a political party necessary. You don’t even have to have any ideas or policy proposals.
Take Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks whose most notable achievement to date has been the Mocha Frappucinno.
Last Tuesday, CNN made Schultz a Serious Presidential Candidate by giving him an hour-long “town hall” in which he fielded questions from an audience.
Why did CNN do this? Because Schultz is worth over $3.6 billion.
In today’s America, someone with this much money can buy so much advertising and self-promotion that he automatically becomes a SPC just by virtue of wanting the job and having the capacity to self-finance a campaign.
Ironically, CNN and other major media are giving Schultz free media now because he can afford an almost infinite amount of paid media later.
Years ago, political parties played the major roles in selecting presidential candidates. Candidates came up through the ranks. They had to convince party leaders across the nation they had what it took to be president. Conventions were the last step in the winnowing process.
Then, over the last several decades, the media took over the job of winnowing the pack. Winners were determined largely by campaign coverage, including presidential primary debates.
Donald Trump became a SPC in 2015 not only because of his billions but also his notoriety as the star of a popular reality TV show and, before that, decades in the tabloids where he learned the art of getting media attention.
Now, it seems, all you need to get the media to anoint you is the money to buy an infinite amount of media.
Part of the reason is the dramatic escalation in presidential campaign spending.
In the 2000 election, neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore spent more than $200 million, in today’s dollars. In 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the total spent by and for Barack Obama was $730 million. In 2016, total spending by Trump and Clinton came to around $1.16 billion.
At the same time, there’s more money at the top to spend on politics. Michael Bloomberg, another SPC, with his own media empire, makes Schultz look like a piker by comparison. Bloomberg is worth over $40 billion, of which he’s already pledged at least 1% – $400 million – to defeating Trump.
It’s not clear if Bloomberg will run. If he does, he’ll run as a Democrat. But Schultz is planning to run as an independent, so he won’t even have to go through the gauntlet of primary battles.
Which means Schultz could deliver the 2020 election to Trump by siphoning off votes from the Democratic candidate.
Schultz cannot win, so why is he running? Not because he has any burning issue he wants to raise, or policy he wants to push. His interviews to date have been curiously anodyne.
Back in 2014, before anyone thought of Trump as a plausible candidate, Schultz berated the incivility he saw in American politics and called for business leaders like himself to “take the lead and do what we can to move the country forward”.
Is that it? He wants more civility?
It didn’t seem to occur to Schultz that America’s growing incivility might be related to the frustrations of people earning coffee grinds while those at the top run off with the Super Venti Flat White.
That same year, Starbucks paid its baristas an average of $9 an hour (it now pays $11, which, adjusted for inflation, isn’t much more). Schultz took home $149.8 million.
Under Schultz, Starbucks touted its so-called “social responsibility,” but it was for show.
Take, for example, the bracelets it sold for $5, whose proceeds were donated to banks and loan funds to support investment in poor communities. At the very same time, Starbucks kept some $1.9 billion offshore to avoid paying US taxes – representing hundreds of millions in lost tax revenues that might otherwise have helped poor communities.
Social responsibility my macchiato. Starbucks spends millions each
year lobbying the federal government, often seeking spending cuts along with the kind of tax breaks that continue to minimize Starbucks’s tax bill.
For Schultz, like Trump, it’s all about money and media.
Schultz is running because he thinks it will be a hoot – the capstone to his coffee career, the apex of his espresso.
But like many other billionaires of America’s New Gilded Age, Schultz doesn’t seem to give a damn about what his political escapades do to America.",['automatically']

David Cicilline of Rhode Island eloquently blasted Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida during Wednesday’s House hearing on gun control.
Rep. Gaetz, known for spreading fake news, conspiracy theories and lies, and supporting the alt-right, announced to the House Judiciary Committee that undocumented immigrants are to blame for gun violence and building President Trump’s wall would reduce the violence.
The far-right Florida Congressman cited no research and did not offer any proof of his claims. In fact, immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, demonstrate lower rates of violence and crime than native-born Americans.
In response, Congressman Cicilline interrupted, asking for a “parliamentary inquiry” – a request to determine the rules – and asked: “Are members in Congress entitled to just make things up?”
Chairman Jerry Nadler said he did not believe there was a rule prohibiting false information, but Members are welcome to challenge them with facts.
Later, Rep. Gaetz directed his comments to Rep. Cicilline, saying Members are “not entitled to their own facts,” while again blaming “violent illegal aliens” for crimes, including murder.
Wednesday’s House hearing on gun violence was the first in 8 years. Republican did not address the issue despite the increase in mass shooting deaths.
At the very end of the video and Rep. Gaetz’s diatribe, someone can be heard saying, “Oh, Jesus Christ” in the audio.

Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['alarm', 'inherently', 'threat']"
"Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trumps-refusal-to-wear-a-mask-isnt-just-vanity-its-a-manifestation-of-his-fascism/,alternet,coronavirus,left,58.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Despite knowing full well the furor that Vice President Mike Pence raised by not wearing a mask during a Mayo Clinic visit in late April, Donald Trump refused to wear a mask when visiting Honeywell factory in Arizona earlier this week — a factory that makes masks. This wasn’t just a symbolic nose-thumbing at people’s reasonable desire to be safe. Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were putting the lives of Honeywell employees in danger.
After all, masks are not primarily meant to protect the mask-wearer, but to protect others, since there’s clear evidence that people who are infected but have no symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Trump is regularly exposed to the virus, in fact — one of his personal valets just tested positive — and is a prime candidate to be such a carrier.
Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.”
“The president said doing so would make it seem like he is preoccupied with health instead of focused on reopening the nation’s economy,” the AP reporters write.
This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear. But there’s also good reason to believe that the Trump-Pence antipathy to wearing masks signals to something deeper and darker.
Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, in her friendly competition with fellow host Tucker Carlson to see who can be the most obnoxious, has started to demonize mask-wearing by claiming that public health advisories are somehow a conspiracy to sow “fear and intimidation.”
(Considering that mask-wearing to protect others took off in Asia long before Trump even ran for president, Ingraham’s conspiracy theory doesn’t possess even the most remote logical consistency.)
Between Trump and Fox News, the practice of mask-wearing is swiftly becoming another culture-war flashpoint. But the question is why. After all, masks seem to make people feel more comfortable with going out in public and going to work, and those are both things Trump dearly wants Americans to return to doing.
But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation. (Many have noted that this same argument could be made against the practice of wearing pants.)
Ultimately, the rejection of mask-wearing really goes back to the fact that Trump, Ingraham and their most faithful followers are guided by fascist impulse, even when they don’t or can’t articulate a fully fleshed-out fascist ideology. Above all other things, the fascist personality is one that rejects even the possibility of sickness. To wear a mask is to publicly admit that one’s body is suspectible to illness, which is coded as “weak” and therefore unacceptable.
Natascha Strobl, an Austrian political scientist who is an expert in far-right organizing and rhetoric, had an important English-language Twitter thread in early April about why the far right was embracing the view that the coronavirus should simply be allowed to run wild. From the beginning, this has been the view Trump clearly prefers on an emotional level and has pushed federal policy toward all along. While Strobl didn’t mention masks, her observations also help explain why these same folks are repulsed by mask-wearing.
The fascist narrative, Strobl explained, is that “men aren’t men anymore, but nervous, urban, overly intellectualized and (here it comes) sickly weaklings.
“Weakness is never worthy of protection and has to be cast out. This is fascism,” she continues. The fascist believes that those viewed as “weak” have an obligation to die “without protest for the greater good” and that if “they don’t do it, they are weak and the weak drag everyone else down and therefore must be done away with.”
To wear a mask, in other words, indicates a belief that your personal body can become infected. A fascist-minded person like Trump cannot admit such a thing, either because he genuinely believes he is too strong to be affected by the virus or because he fears looking weak in public. Just as important, wearing a mask indicates care and concern for others, especially those who are high-risk. But the fascist-minded person doesn’t want to protect those viewed as “weak” — in fact, those people are expected to die so as not to be a burden on others. As Strobl points out, the far right believes that by becoming seriously ill or dying in service to some warped conception of the greater good, the “weak” can prove themselves strong through their sacrifice.
Trump hasn’t exactly concealed his impulse to see the coronavirus as a force that culls the herd of its weakest members, or to perceive that the “weak” can be redeemed through this morbid, sadistic ritual sacrifice. This week, he repeatedly insisted that Americans should think of themselves as “warriors” who bravely go forth and face the virus for the cause of, well, his re-election, which he is convinced depends on reopening the economy without bothering with the testing protocols, contact tracing and other precautions that could make doing so both safe and feasible.
(Even if people are willing to die for a noble cause, it’s worth pausing here and observing gently that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is not such a cause.)
Moreover, Trump has always made a point of presenting himself as the fascist version of the Übermensch, even as he is likely too dim to know that word or what it signifies. Trump is forever bragging about his alleged “good genes,” which he often invokes as being so powerful as to render him a genius-level expert in any number of subjects, from medicine to economics to military strategy, without any need to do anything as weak and effeminate as learning stuff. Wearing a mask would go against his effort to present himself as possessing near-supernatural genetic powers to repel the sorts of viruses with which mere mortals must contend.
Of course, Trump doesn’t actually believe his own lies on this subject (nor on many others). As NBC News has reported, when Trump found out that a White House valet had the coronavirus, he became “lava level mad” at his staff and accused them of not doing enough to protect him. His public bravado is, as with all things Trump, a thin mask plastered over a deep well of insecurity. He may want you to believe his immune system is superhuman, but he knows full well that his obese and shattered 73-year-old physique puts him in the category of the high-risk people he and his fellow Republicans are treating as weaklings better off culled from the herd.
Unfortunately, because face masks have become such a potent symbol to far-right culture warriors of values they reject, such as equality and compassion, we can only expect the symbolic clash over masks to escalate. More and more conservatives, especially men, will try to prove their superior masculine strength and power by refusing to wear them. This is childish, selfish and entirely counterproductive, of course. What else can we expect from Trump and his followers, who are the real weaklings in this unhappy social equation?","['big', 'show', 'contemptuous', 'sneers', 'suckers', 'MAGA-hat-clad']"

And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['chest-thumping', 'cowering', 'objectively', 'funny', 'Unsurprisingly']"
Polling for the Democratic nomination tells a depressing story for those seeking to break the glass ceiling and make the ultimate stand against patriarchy: the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are currently all white men.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/of-course-a-woman-can-beat-trump/,alternet,gender,left,58.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"Polling for the Democratic nomination tells a depressing story for those seeking to break the glass ceiling and make the ultimate stand against patriarchy: the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are currently all white men. Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg lead in almost every poll; the closest female contenders, Warren and Harris, are stalled in single digits often tied with Beto O’Rourke. Which means that nationally known and highly qualified women Senators are tied with a failed Senate candidate and trailing the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, just a few short years after the party nominated its first female candidate for president and four years after the first Afircan-American president left office.
Part of the problem is that many Democratic women are no longer convinced that a woman can beat Trump, and are supporting white men for reasons of electability:
Across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, three of the first states to hold 2020 nominating contests, dozens of women told The Associated Press that they are worried about whether the country is ready to elect a woman as president. Their concerns are political and personal, rooted as much in fear of repeating Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss to Trump as in their own experiences with sexism and gender discrimination… Helen Holden Slottje, a 52-year-old New Hampshire attorney, noted the irony in women raising concerns about nominating a woman. “I fear for that with women, that it’s, ‘Well, we had our chance. We had Hillary. Hillary didn’t pan out. Best to just pick another 65-year-old plus white guy who has the best chance of winning,’” Slottje said.
This is a tragedy, and it’s simply not true. In most head-to-head polling, Senators Warren and Harris would both easily defeat Trump. There were many reasons that Trump defeated Clinton in 2016, and sexism was surely among them. But sexism wasn’t the sole determining factor. Racism played a big part. There was historic cheating and interference from Russia, Comey and much else. Democrats failed to accurately gauge the more populist mood of much of the country, and their views of the real economy beyond the traditional indicators. And Clinton’s campaign simply made a number of profound strategic mistakes.
But in the narrative that followed the 2016 campaign, much of the media and messaging targeted at Democrats repeated that Clinton had done essentially nothing wrong, that Democrats had run the best possible campaign under the circumstances, and that the blame for what happened in 2016 lay not with errors of judgment by the campaigns and those responsible for messaging and tactics at the highest levels of the party, but with the voters themselves. Much of this defense was erected in order to combat recriminations and complaints from the surging Sanders wing of the party–many of which have admittedly ill-founded.
But as I’ve warned in the past, the insistence that nothing could have been done to persuade many of those who voted for Trump without throwing disadvantaged communities under the bus is not only wrong, but carries a heavy price. If you believe that no amount of economic populism or strategic difference could have made a difference in keeping Trump out of the Oval Office, then the necessary and inevitable conclusion is that the public is simply too racist and sexist to elect a woman or person of color against an explicitly racist candidate like Trump. And then predictably, voters most concerned about driving Trump out of office will wind up supporting a white man for misguided strategic reasons.
And that is tragic. A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office.
Kamala Harris would easily be able to dispatch Trump. So would Elizabeth Warren. The polling already shows that, and much the public still has yet to get to know them better. Harris is still largely an unknown, and most voters who know Warren are most familiar not with her strengths but with her weaknesses. More exposure would help them both.
But if Democrats want to avoid setting up yet another older white man as their nominee, they have to be willing to acknowledge that things could have been done differently in 2016 to avoid defeat. Otherwise, the Democratic base is going to draw regrettable conclusions about the state of the electorate and act accordingly.","['depressing', 'patriarchy', 'ultimate']"

The problem? Jeff Bezos is worth over $110 billion. Amazon is not just insanely profitable (thanks in part to worker conditions and business practices that are doing to the American workforce what mankind is doing to its namesake rain forest), but economy-bendingly, history-changingly successful.
The amount of $690,000, or One Million Australian Dollars, is the equivalent of Jeff Bezos sneezing pocket change out his nose and using Australia’s sleeve to wipe it up. It is the Amazon equivalent of sending a Hallmark card. By all means, charity is good and Amazon and other mega-corporations contributing anything to anyone is also good, but if the message was big corporations will take care of this it came off a bit more as big corporations will do the bare minimum required to get a momentary publicity hit.
By way of context, what Amazon, King of All Retailers, is spending to combat Australian fires is roughly on par with the money raised by a single California woman trading nudes for fire donations.
It is also on par with the $516,000 donation toward fighting Australian wildfires pledged by Metallica and a $1 million donation by Elton John.
Amazon may be attempting to make a public statement, but its CEO famously spent $250 million buying his own newspaper. So $690,000 won’t buy you a boat that most of the world’s billionaires would be caught dead on. Hell, $690,000 won’t even buy you a Silicon Valley house.
People can’t help but draw conclusions. A good one to draw might be “The charity of the top 0.1 percent and of corporations both are vastly overstated and not even fractionally as useful as simply taxing them at the same effective rate as the rest of us pay, so maybe we should get on with that already.”

"When he finally spoke in the Rose Garden on Monday, Trump threatened to deploy the military against American citizens if the governors didn’t take his advice for a more forceful crackdown. This threat didn’t appear to cow anyone, and only increased the anger. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-thought-a-violent-crackdown-would-be-a-big-win-but-the-protesters-have-the-upper-hand/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,59.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"From the moment that protests against racist police violence started to spread from Minneapolis to the rest of the country (and the world), after a white police officer named Derek Chauvin killed an unarmed black man named George Floyd in a gruesome incident captured on video, it’s been clear that Donald Trump thought this was exactly the Hail Mary he needed to win re-election. Trump has been desperate for a way to distract the country from the soaring death rate of the coronavirus pandemic (now at 108,000 and counting) and the 40 million left unemployed in the resulting economic collapse. He believed that a racist and sadistic backlash against the protesters was just the ticket.
“Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump tweeted on Saturday, anticipating clashes between protesters and police, who, taking their cues from Trump, have been assaulting peaceful protesters in multiple cities. (If he was hoping his gun-toting supporters from the “heartland” might show up in Washington, they didn’t.)
Trump also tweeted “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” that weekend, echoing a slogan attributed to a notorious Miami police chief in the 1960s.
Trump has kept it up ever since, instructing federal police to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House on Monday evening to clear the area for his ludicrous photo-op holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Square, a stunt that outraged the bishop who oversees that church.
Earlier on Monday, Trump berated state governors in a phone meeting, calling them “weak” for not unleashing more police violence, declaring, “You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you,” and arguing that without violent suppression, the protests will continue.
Now, on the eighth day of these history-shaping protests, Trump’s theory that a violent crackdown will end the protests and cause “real Americans” to rally around him in gratitude has been put to the test. So far, it looks like he couldn’t have been more wrong. Violent crackdowns in many places have only made the protests larger, and polling suggests the public is rejecting Trump’s sadism in large numbers.
When he finally spoke in the Rose Garden on Monday, Trump threatened to deploy the military against American citizens if the governors didn’t take his advice for a more forceful crackdown. This threat didn’t appear to cow anyone, and only increased the anger. More people started joining the protests, despite the ongoing pandemic, and the protests have spread from the cities to many smaller cities and suburbs. Going home at curfew probably would have been a popular choice if Trump had kept his yap shut, but now many protesters are openly defying curfew in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Washington, at least partly to deliver a specific FU to the president.
On the polling front, early numbers suggest that in this battle between protesters, on one hand, and Trump and violent police on the other, the protesters are winning the PR battle. An analysis by Michael Tesler of the Washington Post concludes that “the public views Trump as a racially divisive figure at a time when racial reconciliation is needed.”
Polling from the past few days, according to Tesler’s analysis, shows that only 31% of Americans approved of the looting-and-shooting tweet and only 37% of Americans were willing to say that Trump is not a racist. A majority of Americans — 52% — think Trump is a racist, which, considering how reluctant Americans are to use that word, is a remarkable finding.
Trump’s approval ratings have held stubbornly at around 42%, but these flare-ups that remind people how racist he is —as when he called neo-Nazis “very fine people” in August of 2017 — tend to push it down temporarily to that 37% or so who will never acknowledge any negative evidence about him (probably because they share his views). This suggests that there’s a small but noticeable minority of Trump voters who are made uneasy by his overt racism, and would prefer him to tone it down a little so they can rationalize their support for him.
Trump hasn’t hidden that he feels considerable fondness for the days when Southern police would openly crack skulls, unleash dogs and otherwise violently assault the nonviolent civil rights movement of the ’60s famously led by Martin Luther King Jr. and others, including current Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly waxed nostalgic about that violence, talking about “the good old days” when “they used to treat them very, very rough” and “when they protested once, you know, they would not do it again so easily.” He would whine about how “everybody’s politically correct” these days, and so protesters can’t be “carried out on a stretcher.”
Trump’s invocation of “the good old days” was vague enough that reporters were reluctant to point out the obvious: He was talking about how much he missed watching cops beat up and terrorize civil rights and antiwar protesters during his youth in the ’60s. His behavior these days should remove any plausible deniability.
But while it appears Trump may have fond memories of rooting for the cops against civil rights protesters, no doubt egged on by his father (who was once arrested at a Ku Klux Klan riot in the 1920s), he appears to have forgotten that the cops did not come out on top back then either. On the contrary, the images of shocking violence against peaceful protesters helped build the political will to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the latter of which Trump and his Republican allies have been actively trying to gut (and often succeeding) in recent years.
If Trump is thinking about history at all, he’s focused on the 1968 presidential election, in which Richard Nixon rode a wave of racist backlash against the civil rights movement to victory. He’s not exactly being subtle about his theory, tweeting “SILENT MAJORITY!” , a reference to Nixon’s campaign strategy, on Tuesday.
Overtly comparing himself to one of the most despised presidents in American history is a choice that suggests Trump dramatically overestimating the nostalgia other Americans feel for the viciously reactionary and pro-segregationist politics of the ’60s and ’70s. As multiple historians and historical experts have pointed out — including Todd Gitlin in USA Today, Kevin Kruse in the Washington Post and Jamelle Bouie in the New York Times — Nixon’s victory wasn’t just about harnessing racism. He was also the challenger in 1968, facing an incumbent party that controlled all branches of government and had presided over a decade of military debacle overseas and worsening unrest at home.
“You can’t promise ‘law and order’ when disorder is happening on your watch,” Bouie said, noting that this time around it’s presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden who appears to be reaching voters who yearn for a return to the days of peace and normality.
In addition, political science shows that the number of white voters who thrill to overtly racist appeals is declining. It’s still an unfortunately large proportion, to be clear. But in the 2018 midterms, exit polls showed that despite Trump’s rampant racist demagoguery in the days before the election, the Republican share of the white vote declined from 57% to 54%. That’s a modest change, but in a tight national election, it could make a decisive difference.
Even Republican politicians seem to understand that the writing is on the wall. MSNBC put together a compilation of Republican senators asked for their opinion on Trump tear-gassing protesters so he could have a prettier photo shoot, and the whole thing is an exercise in how fast someone can run away from the camera, while trying not to say anything at all.
Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, an avid Trump enabler in nearly all cases, resorted to a passive non-statement: “Egregious wrongs have been done,” he said. “Much of it recorded.” He did not say had committed the wrongs, or to whom.
No one mistakes Trump’s chest-thumping about “law and order” as a legitimate call for either. After all, Trump is a shameless criminal himself who thrives on division and chaos. For people who like his racism, that’s just fine. But most Americans are disgusted by his racism, and a small but interesting subset of white folks don’t much care about the racism, but would prefer it were kept on the down-low. Both groups appear to be angry with Trump, or at least annoyed, for stoking the fires and calling for more police violence.
None of this is cause for complacency. Trump is still in a shockingly strong position to win re-election, due to voter suppression and the Electoral College that gives disproportionate power to his supporters, especially his most devoted fans in sparsely populated and more rural states. He won in 2016 even though Hillary Clinton got substantially more votes, and that could clearly happen again.
That said, Trump’s margins were paper-thin in crucial swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and depended heavily on that margin of voters who are uncomfortable with his racism but somehow convinced themselves he was preferable to the alternative. The harder Trump makes it for those people to bury their head in the sand, the harder it will be for them to suck it up and vote for him again. His recent antics could make that very difficult indeed. He thought he could “dominate” the protesters, but at least for the moment they have the upper hand.","['cow', 'threatened', 'crackdown']"
"With this in mind, the Trump administration reportedly hopes to reduce poverty in the United States, not by making a material difference in struggling families’ finances, but by tinkering with the threshold for what counts as poverty.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-eyes-plan-reduce-poverty-redefining-it,msnbc,middle-class,left,59.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"There are official metrics the government utilizes to determine eligibility for social-insurance programs. So, for example, for low-income Americans to get food stamps, they have to fall within the poverty threshold.
With this in mind, the Trump administration reportedly hopes to reduce poverty in the United States, not by making a material difference in struggling families’ finances, but by tinkering with the threshold for what counts as poverty.
As the Washington Post’s Helaine Olen explained in a piece last night:
The Trump administration wants to lower the poverty rate in the United States. But there’s a catch: If the plan under discussion is enacted, it would cut the number of people living in poverty not by giving them a wage increase, but by defining them out of it. “Instead of actually doing anything to cut poverty in America, Trump is trying to fudge the numbers to artificially ‘reduce’ the U.S. poverty rate,” said Rebecca Vallas, vice president of the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the Center for American Progress. “It’s mathematical gaslighting.”
As a practical matter, the ideas under consideration are similar to Republican proposals to cut Social Security: if officials change the way in which inflation adjustments are made, fewer would have access to benefits.
None of this is necessary or legally required, of course. Team Trump simply decided to consider changes that would have dramatic effects on those who rely on the social-insurance programs.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities published a related analysis yesterday:
If the poverty line is altered in this fashion, fewer individuals and families will qualify over time for various forms of assistance, including many who work hard but are paid low wages. That’s because using a lower measure of inflation like the chained CPI to adjust the poverty line each year would make the eligibility thresholds for various programs that serve people in need lower and lower over time, compared with what the thresholds otherwise would be. This, in turn, would lower the income eligibility limits for programs like SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) and Medicaid, which are tied to the federal poverty line. It also would reduce the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) premium tax credits — and thereby increase the out-of-pocket premium charges faced by millions of people who purchase health insurance through the ACA marketplaces.
The change isn’t yet official or final, though the Office of Management and Budget – which I think is still technically led by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney – formally proposed a regulatory change this week.
In doing so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities added, the administration “presented no research on how low-income families’ costs for basic necessities has changed over time, the adequacy of the poverty line itself as compared to the cost of basic necessities, or the implications of changing the poverty line for individuals’ and families’ access to needed assistance.”
A cynic might wonder if the administration is just clumsily pursuing such a change to scratch an ideological itch.",['tinkering']

No doubt these folks are aware that COVID-19 is a microscopic virus and therefore is not something you can shoot. No, obviously, the fear is about the economy collapsing (thanks for the negligence, Donald Trump!), leading to a rise in crime and violence, in which people imagine they can use these guns to defend their lives, families and property. Also, decades of NRA propaganda have convinced people to associate guns with safety. Indeed, as the economy craters, the NRA is treating this crisis as another opportunity to sell guns to people. What else would it do?
During every disaster, the @NRA stokes panic in order to juice gun sales. Stocking up on guns in response to a pandemic is a risky and uniquely American response that carries with it increased likelihood of intimate partner violence, unintentional shootings, and gun suicide. https://t.co/gI2xB3G0gZ — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 21, 2020
But the last thing anyone should be doing in this crisis, if they want to stay safe, is to buy a gun. Buying a gun right now will make your family and your home less safe, especially if you, like many panic buyers, are not trained in gun safety and don’t have the proper storage.
Buying a gun significantly raises the chances of someone in your house being injured or killed in an accident, a suicide attempt or interpersonal violence. The hospitals are already buckling down, fearful that coronavirus will fill up ICUs and emergency rooms. Adding avoidable gun injuries to the mix isn’t just foolish. It’s selfish.
“Guns make your home less safe,” Dr. Mark Hoofnagle, a trauma surgeon in St. Louis, told Salon. “If you have children in the house, it will certainly make you less safe.”
Hoofnagle said he is a gun owner himself, but added, “The idea that a gun is a safety device is completely absurd.”
The research backs him up. In August 2019, researchers looked at what happened in the aftermath of these runs on gun stores, which tend to happen during a crisis or right after a widely-publicized mass shooting. Their findings, which were published in the journal Injury Epidemiology, showed that in the year after such a spike in gun purchases, the number of firearm-related injuries in a community went up.
And that’s without the exacerbating factors that Americans are experiencing now, which include being stuck at home most of the day and potentially losing their employment income. Right now, people in our country are under the kind of stress that increases domestic violence and suicide attempts — both of which are more likely to result in serious injury or death if there’s a gun in the home. In addition, kids are off school and sitting around bored, which means they’re more likely to stumble across a gun in the home and shoot themselves or someone else by accident.
In addition, as Hoofnagle noted, this is “not exactly a great time to take classes or find a spot at the range” to learn how to use a newly purchased weapon properly. That will also lead to elevated chance of a gun accident in the home.
Of course, no one wants to imagine they’ll be the ones who have an accident, or who attempt suicide in a dark moment, or who get into a lethal fight with a spouse, or whose child finds the gun and fires it. No, the panic buyers are all imagining themselves as heroic self-defenders, warding off all the bad guys that will attack their homes and families in the societal chaos that they (plausibly enough) suspect is coming because of this pandemic and the economic collapse resulting from Trump’s epic mismanagement.
But people should set aside their fantasies of “protecting their stockpile of Charmin,” as Hoofnagle put it. The idea that guns are effective at self-defense is a myth, which is constantly propped up by the gun industry and has been repeatedly disproved by independent researchers.
The Harvard Injury Control Research Center has compiled the evidence and found that most claims of “self-defense” after a gun fight were not, as people imagine, tales of manly men heroically defending their families against some baddie breaking in a window. Most of these incidents, in fact, involved people who escalated an argument or confrontation to a lethal level by whipping out a gun. Indeed, if there’s a gun in the home, it’s far more likely to be used by one household member to intimidate another than to protect them.
In other words, the people rushing out to buy guns right now are not likely to use them to defend themselves. What will happen instead, in far too many cases, is that they’ll be cooped up with a spouse and get into fights in which someone —generally, in the real world, this is a man — grabs the gun and threatens their spouse with it. While there are many factors that go into any such incident, the psychological damage and the risk of serious injury or death is drastically increased by the presence of a gun.
Everyone is feeling helpless and scared right now, and wants to find ways to gain a sense of control over their lives. There are plenty of things we can do that are actually helpful: Clean and organize your house. Hold a FaceTime happy hour with friends. Learn a new hobby. Install a security system at your house, if you’re worried about break-ins. Donate to a Democratic candidate, in hopes of getting the White House monster who got us into this disaster out of office.
But one thing you should not do is buy a gun. It won’t make you or your family safer. On the contrary, it might lead to someone getting shot — and needing to be rushed to a hospital that’s already in danger of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus. So stay home and stay safe. Leave the guns alone.","['propaganda', 'craters', 'crisis']"

Coronavirus: E.U. blasts Trump's travel ban as it unleashes chaos and confusion.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/coronavirus-europe-wakes-chaos-confusion-trump-restricts-travel-n1156286,msnbc,coronavirus,left,59.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"LONDON — President Donald Trump's ban on most travel from 26 European countries caused uproar on the continent early Thursday, with E.U. leaders blasting Trump's decision and saying they were not consulted, as chaos and confusion erupted at several major airports.
European Union leaders issued a rare joint statement condemning Trump's move, saying it was taken ""unilaterally and without consultation."" They also condemned attacks he made on them during an address Wednesday night, when he accused the E.U. of spreading the virus in the U.S. by not imposing sufficient travel restrictions on China and elsewhere.
""The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent, and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" said a joint statement from Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and the European Council respectively.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" they added. ""The European Union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the virus.""
Meanwhile, Americans and foreigners scrambled to work out what it meant for their plans to travel to the U.S. Others questioned the logic of Trump's move and whether it would actually help the effort to slow the spread of the contagion.
The president announced late Wednesday that he was banning travel to the U.S. for any foreign nationals who had traveled to one of more than two dozen European countries within the past 14 days.
Trump explicitly called it a ""foreign virus"" and said ""a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.""
The U.S. had more than 1,600 confirmed cases as of Thursday, including 41 deaths, with the Trump administration coming under enormous criticism for the lack of coronavirus testing that's being done compared with certain other countries.
The travel ban goes into effect Friday at midnight, and the restrictions apply only to foreign nationals, not U.S. citizens, green card holders or the families of U.S. citizens.
However, during the president's initial address to the nation, the distinctions were less clear, with Trump saying the U.S. would ""be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.""

He did add that ""there will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings"" — but that appeared to do little to temper the confusion and alarm at several European airports.

""I see Americans crying at the airport right now worried about their jobs and coming home,"" Muhammad Alameldin, 24, told NBC News from the airport in Barcelona, Spain.
He and his fiancée, Monique Sanchez, 24, who are from Berkeley, California, woke up to the news at 6 a.m. before heading to the U.S. Consulate and then, when that produced no results, the airport.
""My flight was canceled, and I've been in line for over three hours waiting to transfer or get a voucher for my flight,"" he said. ""No one has heard or seen anything thus far. It's a failure in U.S. policy and shows that the president doesn't know how to take care of Americans abroad.""
NBC News journalist Shannon Ho was at Berlin Tegel Airport in Germany, returning home from vacation, hours after the move was announced. ""Lots of chaotic energy in Tegel right now,"" she said. ""Americans are stressed and just trying to get home,"" she added after speaking with several U.S. citizens there amid the panic.

Ho met with one American who woke up his boss at 3 a.m. demanding that his Saturday flight be rescheduled. A Tesla worker cut short their trip by three weeks. And another young man found out about Trump's announcement while at a Berlin nightclub.
""He essentially left, booked this flight en route to his hostel and came straight"" to the airport, she said.

Elsewhere, travelers reported long lines of Americans trying to get home at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. New York Times reporter Mike McIntire described the situation as ""bedlam"" and said Americans were paying as much as $20,000 for tickets home.
At Amsterdam's Schiphol airport — which normally has 200 flights to the U.S. every week — there were long lines at the KLM desk as passengers tried to get more information, airport spokeswoman Madelon van der Hof confirmed by telephone.
The airport said in a written statement: ""We are now mapping out, together with the airlines, what this means exactly for flights to the U.S.""
The restrictions affect countries within the Schengen Area — named after the Luxembourg town where the agreement was signed in 1985. It is a group of countries between which it's possible to travel without a passport. (That's the theory — some rolling restrictions are in place between certain countries following factors such as terrorist attacks in recent years.)

Schengen is different from the European Union; Ireland is not a member, and although the United Kingdom recently left the E.U., it was never part of the club, either. As such, both countries were exempt from Trump's travel ban.
That has led some to question whether it would be possible to get past the restrictions simply by connecting in London or Dublin. The statement released by Trump did not answer that point.
Furthermore, both the U.K. and Ireland had more cases, 459 and 43 as of Wednesday respectively, than many countries that were included within the ban. Slovakia, for example, had 10 confirmed cases, and Poland had 41.
A study published last week in Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal, found that travel restrictions ""will have modest effects"" and that other domestic measures to prevent the spread would ""provide the greatest benefit to mitigate the epidemic.""
That was echoed by the U.K.'s finance minister, Rishi Sunak, early Thursday.
Following the travel ban @realDonaldTrump announced, we will assess the situation today.
Economic disruption must be avoided. #Europe is taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the #COVID19 virus, limit the number of affected people and support research. — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) March 12, 2020
""With regard to flight bans, we are always guided by the science as we make our decisions here,"" he told the BBC. ""The advice we are getting is that there isn't evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infection.""
Michel, president of the European Council, tweeted that ""we will assess the situation today"" following Trump's announcement.","['chaos', 'confusion', 'blasts', 'unleashes']"
‘A new low’: Washington Post media critic blows up Tucker Carlson’s absurd lies about white nationalism,https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/a-new-low-washington-post-media-critic-blows-up-tucker-carlsons-absurd-lies-about-white-nationalism/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,59.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"On Saturday, August 3, El Paso became the scene of a terrorist attack that left 22 people dead — and the suspect, according to police, had written a manifesto indicating that he planned to target Latinos specifically because they were “invading” Texas. The attack has focused attention on the terrorist threat posed by white supremacists and white nationalists, but on Tuesday, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson insisted that white supremacy is a “hoax” — and with that comment, Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan asserts, Carlson has “hit a new low.”
To hear Carlson tell it, white supremacy isn’t a real problem in the United States. Carlson, on Tuesday, declared, “This is a hoax, just like the Russia hoax. It’s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power.”
In response, Sullivan writes in her August 7 column that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation was no laughing matter — explaining that “the Russian attacks on America’s voting integrity, in order to help Donald Trump become president, are anything but a hoax, as the Mueller Report made abundantly clear.”
Most of Sullivan’s column, however, is devoted to Carlson’s ridiculous views on white supremacy and his use of “empirical evidence” (she uses that term sarcastically) to show that it isn’t a problem. Carlson said, “I’ve lived here 50 years, and I’ve never met anybody — not one person — who ascribes to white supremacy. I don’t know a single person who thinks that’s a good idea.”
Sullivan’s snarky response: “Hmm. Maybe his sample size is a bit flawed.” And the Post columnist goes on to state that not only is racism alive and well in the U.S. — it is one of the “core tenets of the opinion-mongers at Fox News,” including Carlson.
“Carlson’s nightly show does a great deal to portray nonwhites as the dangerous ‘other,’ a force to be beaten back to save America,” Sullivan writes. “His denials and rhetoric must be called out for the lies that they are.”
At Fox News, Sullivan notes, the word “invasion” has been used repeatedly to describe “migrants coming to America, generally people of color from countries south of the border.” And the manifesto that, according to police, was posted online the day of the El Paso terrorist attack, states, “This attack is a response to (the) Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
Sullivan not only calls out Carlson in her column, but also, “Fox and Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade —who, this week, insisted, “If you use the term ‘an invasion,’ that’s not anti-Hispanic. It’s a fact.” Sullivan’s response to Kilmeade: “No, it’s racist propaganda.”
Sullivan concludes her column by explaining where Carlson can find an example of a white supremacist.
“Tucker Carlson has become one of the most high-profile perpetrators of this appalling and divisive message, one constantly amplified by the president,” Sullivan writes. “So, if Carlson thinks he hasn’t met a single white supremacist, he might want to take a searching look in the mirror.”","['absurd', 'lies', 'blows', 'up']"
"The utter failure of private capitalism to prepare for the coronavirus should have surprised no one. Private capitalism, as business school graduates repeat, focuses on profit. The “profit incentive,” they learn, makes private capitalism the superior, “most efficient” economic system available.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/why-the-neoliberal-agenda-is-a-failure-at-fighting-coronavirus/,alternet,coronavirus,left,60.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"The utter failure of private capitalism to prepare for the coronavirus should have surprised no one. Private capitalism, as business school graduates repeat, focuses on profit. The “profit incentive,” they learn, makes private capitalism the superior, “most efficient” economic system available. That is its “bottom line” and “chief goal.” The problem is that to produce adequate numbers of testing components, masks, gloves, ventilators, hospital beds, etc., and then to store, secure, monitor, maintain and demographically stockpile them were not and are not privately profitable businesses.
A private capitalist producer of those goods would have to wait, perhaps a long time, for them to become marketable. The risk is great, the future price unknowable, and profitability hard to count on. So private capitalists looked and found elsewhere to invest. They did not produce or stockpile the items needed to secure the public’s health by preventing or minimizing a viral pandemic.
Of course, private capitalism’s failures could have been offset if governments compensated for them. Governments might have purchased the necessary medical supplies from private capitalists as they emerged from production at prices yielding them good profits. Governments could then have stored, monitored, replenished, and stockpiled them, and absorbed the costs and risks involved. Indeed, governments in many countries did that. But few maintained stockpiles sufficient for “abnormal” or “serious” viral threats. Most stockpiled only smaller “normal flu” levels of the needed medical supplies.
Ideas and practices of government compensating for private capitalism’s failures and flaws are old. Business cycle downturns have brought repeated government economic interventions. They do so now. Another pertinent example is government intervention to procure military supplies. It is privately unprofitable to produce, store, secure, monitor, and strategically stockpile tanks, missiles, guns, airplanes, etc., needed for war or “defense.” Private capitalists would not likely produce or import them given the risks and uncertainties of future military conflict. So governments contract to buy them as they are produced at prices profitable for private producers of military supplies. Governments cover the costs and risks of storing, securing, and stockpiling. These immense government subsidies to private capitalists get justified as requirements of national security.
What governments do to prepare for military security they do not do (or do inadequately) for health security from, for example, dangerous microbes. Yet viruses have threatened human beings at least as long as military conflict has. Many more Americans were killed by the 1918 influenza pandemic than died in the 1914-1918 world war. Coronavirus has already killed many more Americans than died in the Vietnam War.
Why then do governments compensate for private capitalism’s failures in the military but compensate so much less in the medical industries? And when governments do compensate in the latter, why so differently, varying from much in some countries to little to almost nothing in others?
Neoliberalism’s ideological power, varying from country to country, provides an answer. Where it is strong, governments minimize economic interventions. They cultivate blindness to private capitalism’s failures and often simply deny them. Officials thus cannot publicly and explicitly undertake to “compensate for failures” in, say, the private medical industries. Trump expressed his neoliberalism by dissolving Obama’s White House pandemic preparedness organization.
Neoliberalism argues for laissez-faire. Private enterprises left alone to produce and market without governmental taxation, regulation, etc., will outperform systems where governments intervene. Neoliberalism celebrates the private over the governmental nearly everywhere. It is a kind of fundamentalism in economics: God is private, while the devil is government. The exceptions—the military, police, and judiciary—prove the rule: all other social institutions must be private to work best. Markets, like enterprises, should be “free,” i.e., not subject to government.
Neoliberal politicians decline to organize, endorse, or support governmental production, import, storage, securing, or stockpiling of virtually anything that private capitalists are or could be doing instead. Private profit, not bureaucratic fiat, should be the guiding goal of the production and distribution of all goods and services (more or less excepting military, police, and judiciary). Libertarianism is a more extreme version of neoliberalism.
Where neoliberalism is strong, governmental preparations for and copings with coronavirus were weak, too late, and too little: as in the U.S., the UK, and Italy, among others. In societies where neoliberalism is relatively weak, government is accorded considerable respect and deference. Its anti-viral initiatives and policies including economic interventions were welcomed or at least expected to play positive roles. Examples include China, South Korea, and New Zealand, among others. Where neoliberalism is weak, government economic interventions can receive ad hoc criticisms and oppositions, but they are not opposed in principle. Where neoliberalism is strong, opponents define government as always and necessarily an inefficient intruder into what private enterprise, if left alone, would do better.
Neoliberalism is a preferred ideology of private capitalist employers. This “special interest”—a very small social minority—embraces neoliberalism in self-interest. Its neoliberalism proclaims private capitalists’ utter superiority to any other social group that threatens or might threaten its economic dominance. It thus excoriates labor unions and government bureaucracies and, sometimes, the monopolization of big businesses for interfering in and distorting free markets.
Neoliberalism views some government economic interventions as distorting intrusions into private capitalism; it views others as comprising an evil alternative to private capitalism. The label “socialism” serves neoliberals nicely to capture both horrors. On the one hand, it designates government meddling in free-market capitalism. On the other, it signifies government-owned and operated enterprises and government-planned distribution of resources and products. As private capitalism’s chief theoretical champion, neoliberalism seeks to vanquish the enemy theories of Marx and Keynes.
Whatever we think of the theoretical jousting, coronavirus has sharply clarified neoliberalism’s profound social costs. Millions are sick and many thousands dead because of governments’ delayed and inadequate compensations for private capitalism’s failures to prepare for or cope with the virus. Dangerous viruses have attacked human society many times throughout history. Preparing for the next attack—thereby securing public health—has long been a basic duty of all social systems. Feudalism failed in that duty when many millions of Europeans succumbed to the Black Death in the 14th century. That failure weakened European feudalism. Capitalism is failing in that duty now with coronavirus, in part because of neoliberalism.
As that lesson sinks in to contemporary consciousness, major challenges confront and will likely also weaken both neoliberalism and capitalism.

This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['ruthless', 'weenie-ness', 'feebly', 'assuage', 'nonviolent', 'display']"
"Sanders' team feels he has been unfairly and inaccurately accused of sexism while Warren's allies took special offense to Sanders' campaign manager going on TV to say her recollection of events was a ""lie.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/warren-sanders-de-escalate-campaign-feud-over-contested-remark-n1115881?cid=public-rss_20200115,msnbc,gender,left,60.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The nonaggression pact between Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts faced its most difficult test and seemed to hold — at least for now.
In Tuesday night's debate, the two progressive senators de-escalated a tense round of tit-for-tat exchanges between their presidential campaigns over the charged issues of gender and electability.
But an icy moment at the end of the debate, when Warren appeared to refuse Sanders' handshake, suggests the wound may not have healed yet, even if both campaigns believe it is in their strategic interest to strike a detente.
Aides and supporters of both senators, who have more or less remained allies even while running against each other for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, had accused each other of dirty tricks and lying in recent days after a series of leaks to the media, culminating in Warren saying in a statement that Sanders once told her he didn't think a woman could win the presidency.
But when the topic came up Tuesday night, both sought to set the issue aside and move on, even as Sanders again denied telling Warren a woman couldn't win during a one-on-one meeting in 2018.
""I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want,"" he said. ""Anybody knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be president of the United States.""
He went on to say that he had been ready to defer to Warren and not run for president if she had decided to do so in 2016, and said he would work to elect any of the candidates on stage should he fail to win the nomination this year.

Warren seemed happy to move on from Sanders, but acknowledged that many Democrats have serious doubts about whether Americans would elect a woman after Hillary Clinton's 2016 electoral college loss to President Donald Trump.
""I disagreed,"" Warren said of her thoughts on their reported 2018 discussion. “Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But, look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head on. And I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record. So, can a woman beat Donald Trump?""
The issue of electability — an unknowable factor — has chased Warren since her first trip to Iowa just over a year ago as she has worked to persuade Democratic voters she can win against Trump. Many Democratic voters have said they believe that sexism does makes it harder for women to win than for men.
Warren's campaign is well aware of this challenge and has tried to find moments to push back on it, so Warren seemed happy on Tuesday to turn the Sanders spat into a chance to make the pitch herself.
Warren noted that the men on stage had collectively lost 10 elections while the two women — herself and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — had won every election.
""And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me,"" Warren added, referring to her 2012 victory over Republican Scott Brown, who won a special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy's Senate seat.
Sanders pushed back on that claim, saying he wanted to ""set the record straight"" by noting he ousted an incumbent Republican to win a seat in Congress in 1990.
Warren smirked, before gently noting that she placed her timeline within 30 years. Sanders’ 1990 election is months short of being 30 years ago.
""Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact,"" he conceded.
And Warren took one more chance to try to dispel electability concerns, pointing out that many Democrats worried Americans wouldn't elect a Roman Catholic when the party nominated John F. Kennedy in 1960 and a black man in 2008 when its voters picked Barack Obama. And she noted that women helped power Democrats' House takeover in 2018.
The episode has been personal for both camps.
Sanders' team feels he has been unfairly and inaccurately accused of sexism while Warren's allies took special offense to Sanders' campaign manager going on TV to say her recollection of events was a ""lie.""
That tension seemed evident between the candidates themselves after the debate concluded and Sanders crossed the stage to try to shake Warren's hand. She moved her hand away, and then told him something, which was not picked up on the microphones and which both campaigns have so far declined to reveal.
Another candidate, billionaire Tom Steyer, happened to be standing nearby during the awkward moment, but wanted no part of the drama when asked about it later by MSNBC's Chris Matthews.
""I don’t know what they were saying,” he said. “Whatever was going on I was trying to get out of the way as fast as possible.”",['lie']

In the recent past, news consumers would come across headlines that referenced a “GOP lawmaker” who said or did something foolish, leaving readers to wonder which Republican the piece was referring to. More often than not, it was Michele Bachmann, Louie Gohmert, or Paul Broun.
And while some of these more cartoonish members are still on Capitol Hill – Gohmert and Steve King, for example, keep getting re-elected – we’re occasionally reminded about the torch being passed to a new generation of lawmakers who are equally difficult to take seriously.
The Washington Post reported yesterday, for example, on some of the antics on display during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence.
A congressional hearing on gun violence erupted into recriminations on Wednesday after Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) argued for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and called for the removal of two fathers whose children were killed in last year’s mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Gaetz, one of President Trump’s most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill, prompted an outcry from the Parkland fathers when he argued at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that illegal immigration is a greater threat to public safety than gun violence.
The far-right Floridian already had an unfortunate reputation, and yesterday’s display won’t help Gaetz’s poor standing.
But while the congressman and his absurdities mattered, let’s not miss the forest for the trees: there was actually a House hearing yesterday on gun violence.
That may not seem especially notable, but this was the first House hearing on guns this decade. As Rachel noted on last night’s show, there have been all kinds of horrible mass shootings in recent years, including the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, but none of them prompted the House, controlled by Republicans from January 2011 until last month, to convene a single policy discussion on the issue.
We finally know what it takes to get the House to examine gun violence: it’s not a mass shooting; it’s an election.
In this case, yesterday’s hearing wasn’t just a generic discussion. At issue is a piece of legislation, H.R. 8 – unveiled on the anniversary of the Tucson Shooting that nearly claimed the life of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) – which would require background checks on U.S. gun sales.
As of this morning, the bill has 231 co-sponsors, five of whom are Republicans. Since it takes 218 votes to pass a bill in the House, I have a hunch the bill will clear the chamber, Matt Gaetz’s efforts notwithstanding.
Its chances in the Republican-led Senate, however, aren’t as good.","['finally', 'shooting']"
"Many people in politics and media are still not used to female power, and Pelosi’s novel position, while creating some pointless problems for her, also gives her some surprising advantages.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/how-nancy-pelosi-is-using-trumps-sexism-against-him-and-totally-owning-him/,alternet,gender,left,60.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"From the moment Donald Trump was elected president, the face of the resistance has been female: the Women’s March, the #MeToo movement, the surge of women who ran (and won) as Democratic candidates, the women running Indivisible and other organizing groups around the country.
So it’s fitting that the face of the elected officials who are now empowered to check Trump — the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives — is a woman, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi is a compelling foil for Trump in many ways, bringing experience and intelligence to bear in a battle against a man whose overconfidence is only matched by his inexperience and incuriosity. But her gender adds an interesting dimension to the drama, creating a far different dynamic than would spool out if the Democratic leader were, as most members of Congress still are, a man. Many people in politics and media are still not used to female power, and Pelosi’s novel position, while creating some pointless problems for her, also gives her some surprising advantages.
This was made quite clear in this week’s showdown over the State of the Union address.
No doubt Pelosi’s prowess at Capitol Hill politics was on full display in her choice to deny Trump his chance at delivering the annual speech until he decides to end the shutdown. The move showcased Pelosi’s talent at reading people and figuring out what actually motivates them. Trump will never be moved with appeals to decency, as he has no decency and doesn’t even pretend to care about it. But taking away opportunities for him to preen and brag before a national audience hits him where it hurts.
More subtly, however, Pelosi is also using her gender to put Trump — who is visibly unnerved by having any woman around that isn’t clearly there to serve him, sexually or otherwise — on his heels. Trump is already a terrible politician with no discernible deal-making skills, and he’s clearly rattled by Pelosi in the same way that he was rattled by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential debates. So he’s avoiding direct conflict and hiding in the White House sending out tweets, rather than deal with this woman who unnerves him by merely existing and refusing to be subservient.",['pointless']
"In an age when media stardom apparently confers some kind of universal expertise, it’s probably not a complete surprise that Republican House leaders keep trotting out pundit/provocateur Candace Owens to testify in congressional hearings on what should be a matter requiring the utmost seriousness and gravity: white nationalist terrorism and its toll on the American social fabric.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/why-do-republicans-keep-inviting-candace-owens-to-testify-on-white-nationalism/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,61.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"In an age when media stardom apparently confers some kind of universal expertise, it’s probably not a complete surprise that Republican House leaders keep trotting out pundit/provocateur Candace Owens to testify in congressional hearings on what should be a matter requiring the utmost seriousness and gravity: white nationalist terrorism and its toll on the American social fabric.
After all, who else are they going to find who would be willing to just openly gaslight members of Congress, telling them not to believe the evidence of the dead in Pittsburgh and Christchurch and El Paso and many other mass-killing sites, by wielding her blackness like a shield? Other than, say, Diamond and Silk or Michelle Malkin, who have about the same amount of experience and expertise regarding domestic terrorism as Owens does—which is to say, none whatsoever.
Last week, it backfired on them.
Owens made another made-for-viral-video appearance last Friday before the House Oversight and Reform subcommittees on national security and civil rights and civil liberties, launching into one of her patented tirades in which she lectured both members of Congress and academic experts who had been called by Democrats to testify. Afterward, she dismissed one of them—the University of Chicago professor Kathleen Belew, who has published multiple peer-reviewed works on the issue—as a “made-up professor.”
“White supremacy is indeed real, but despite the media’s obsessive coverage of it, it represents an isolated, uncoordinated and fringe occurrence within America,” Owens told the committee.
Unfortunately for Owens, the Department of Homeland Security that very morning published its findings that white nationalist terrorism was a major national security threat that warranted the full attention of all components of American law enforcement: “The continuing menace of racially based violent extremism, particularly white supremacist extremism, is an abhorrent affront to our nation, the struggle and unity of its diverse population, and the core values of both our society and our department,” said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in a Brookings Institute speech.
﻿
Owens, however, was undaunted.
“You know that white supremacy and white nationalism ranks nowhere near the top issues that are facing black America,” she added. “And the reason that you are bringing them up in this room is because it is an attempt to make the election all about race, as Democrats do.”
The performance was essentially a reprise of her earlier testimony in April before the House Judiciary Committee, when Owens insisted similarly that “white supremacy, racism, white nationalism, words that once held real meaning, have now become nothing more than election strategies. Every four years, the black community is offered handouts and fear. Handouts and fear. Reparations and white nationalism. This is the Democrats’ preview.”
Her claims echo the whitewashing job attempted by Tucker Carlson around the earlier House hearings, as well as his more recent claims that “white nationalism is a hoax.” As with Carlson’s soft-pedaled version of things, Owens’ insistence that the threat of far-right white terrorism doesn’t matter to the black community doesn’t meet the reality smell test.
Owens defended herself Friday by insisting that her blackness was credential enough to claim expertise in domestic terrorism. “This hearing is a farce,” she said. “It is ironic that you’re having three Caucasian people testify and tell you what their expertise are. Do you want to know what my expertise are? Black in America. I’ve been black in America my whole life, all 30 years, and I can tell you guys have done the exact same thing every four years ahead of an election cycle, and it needs to stop.”
As committee Chair Jamie Raskin pointed out at the time, “[T]he title of our hearing is ‘Confronting Violent White Supremacy: Addressing the Transnational Terrorist Threat’”—that is, it was an attempt to consider the global reach of the white nationalist movement. It was only incidentally about the impact of white nationalism on the black community.
Belew sharply contradicted Owens’ testimony. “Well, we have a history of treating it like it doesn’t matter, and the result of that has been death and destruction and the disruption of all kinds of people’s lives,” she observed. As for the lack of numbers, she explained, one only need look at the history of civilian surveillance in the U.S.:
From the outset, surveillance in the United States has been a profoundly political project. So we can go all the way back to the 1960s and think about how things like the FBI Counterintelligence Program were unequally targeted. COINTELPRO, people in this room might know, was a project that sought to disrupt fringe activism on both the left and on the right. But we know from the history that it was profoundly more focused on the left and on activists of color than on the right. So Klan groups were infiltrated, but there were no deaths of Klan activists in this period at the hands of FBI informants, nor was there a cohesive effort to disrupt those groups the way that there was on the left. Similarly, our resources have been overwhelmingly dedicated to confronting Islamic or international terror rather than white or domestic terror. The reason we don’t have these numbers is because there hasn’t been an aggregating data project within the federal government.
The Department of Homeland Security also contradicted Owens, though in a separate setting. “The United States faces an evolving threat environment and a threat of terrorism and targeted violence within our borders that is more diverse than at any time since the 9/11 attacks,” McAleenan said on Friday. “We are acutely aware of the growing threat from enemies, both foreign and domestic, who seek to incite violence in our nation’s youth, disenfranchised, and disaffected, in order to attack their fellow citizens.”","['trotting', 'nationalist', 'terrorism', 'provocateur', 'pundit']"

"It can take hard work, creativity, perseverance and luck to become a millionaire, but in today’s skewed wealth system, multibillionaires don’t need any of that — their money does all the work to lift them above everyone else.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/here-are-the-dirty-secrets-of-how-the-rich-become-the-uber-rich/,alternet,middle-class,left,61.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"As Ray Charles wailed in a song of true-life blues, “(T)hem that’s got are them that gets/ And I ain’t got nothin’ yet.”
While the workaday majority of Americans continue to be mired in our low-wage economy, the precious few at the tippy top soared out of sight in 2019. They started the year wallowing in wealth — and the more they had, the more they got. As tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, by year’s end, the 500 richest people saw their total haul jump by 25 percent, with $1.2 trillion added to their collective net worth! Indeed, the wealth of the wealthiest is growing so large so fast that a new category of ultra-richness has been coined: “centibillionaires,” those who have amassed more than $100 billion.
Mark Zuckerberg, the ethically challenged jefe of Facebook, is one of them, and he piled up and extra $27 billion in personal wealth last year. Bill Gates of Microsoft added $22 billion to his stash. And even though Amazon czar Jeff Bezos dropped $9 billion last year in a divorce settlement, his fortune multiplied so much that he’s still the world’s richest person.
Bear in mind that none of these moneyed elites did anything to earn these extraordinary bonanzas. They didn’t work any harder, didn’t get smarter, didn’t add anything of value to society. They simply reclined in luxury and let their money make money. That’s a dirty little secret of our rigged economic system: Unfettered inequality begets ever-expanding inequality.
Another dirty little secret is that billionaire-ism and centibillionaire-ism are hereditary. Right-wing media baron Rupert Murdoch, for example, saw his enormous level of riches fall by $10 billion in 2019 but only because he doled out that wad of wealth to his six children. So, voila! Thus were born six brand-spanking-new baby billionaires who did nothing to reach the top of the world’s financial heap except please Daddy.
Not only are the rich different from you and me but they’re also different from the filthy rich. It can take hard work, creativity, perseverance and luck to become a millionaire, but in today’s skewed wealth system, multibillionaires don’t need any of that — their money does all the work to lift them above everyone else.
I’m guessing that being rich is a comfortable feeling — no money worries; you’re set for life!
But is it possible that too rich can be too much, even discombobulating? Imagine being Mark Zuckerberg, who has become richer than Croesus by amalgamating vast troves of nearly everyone’s personal data and then using it piecemeal for global corporations, governments, political groups and who knows who else through his Facebook social media monopoly. Last year, his mass peddling of our privacy put another $27.3 billion in his pocket.
Imagine. On top of already having billions of bucks tucked away, suddenly, in a single year, here comes 27.3 more gushing into your treasury. Forget fundamental questions about whether you (or anyone) are worthy of such an excessive haul of the world’s wealth. How do you spend it? Mansions, yachts, jets, jewels, your personal island and other trinkets barely dent your multibillionous windfall. Funding political front groups and financing corporate-friendly candidates takes a little chunk of your change, as do some charity donations. And since the Trumpeteers slashed taxes for the corporate rich, far less of your extraordinarily good fortune is diverted to public need and America’s common good.
Thus, the bulk of your booty goes to making you even richer! You buy out other corporations and advanced technologies, and you dump billions into Wall Street, intentionally and artificially jacking up the price of stocks you own. Your wealth expands exponentially; inequality spreads further and faster; and the egalitarian ideals that hold our huge, diverse society together are stretched to the breaking point.
Interestingly, more and more of the uber-rich are comprehending the ultimate consequences of such extreme selfishness, so they’re responding with extreme consumerism. Specifically, they’ve created a boom in the sale of maximum-security, James Bond-ish armored vehicles. Priced in the half-million-dollar range, these rolling fortresses can come with 700 horsepower engines, tailpipe-to-grille anti-blast protection, door handles that can electrocute intruders, roof-mounted gun turrets and room for 10 fully equipped bodyguards.
With names like Marauder and Black Shark, these armored beasts have become the preferred rides of gabillionaires — not to flaunt their fortunes but to fend off the masses they’ve ripped off.

"Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/worse-than-a-preschooler-donald-trump-is-failing-the-marshmallow-test/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,61.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Fifty years ago, in a now-classic experiment, Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel and his colleagues presented preschoolers with a plate of treats and a dilemma: They could have one marshmallow now or wait 20 minutes and get two marshmallows later.
The kids who managed to wait (despite a plateful of temptation in front of them) turned out to be generally more successful than their more impatient peers. Their grades were better, their SAT scores were higher, they were healthier and socially better-adjusted. The experiment set off an explosion of scholarship on the benefits of delayed gratification, perseverance, and “grit.” It’s one reason “self-mastery” and “self-control” are part of almost every kindergartener’s curriculum today.
America is now facing something like a national Marshmallow Test. Many states are pushing to reopen their economies, even with plentiful evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As summer beckons and restrictions loosen, citizens will have to judge just how far they’ll reach for a taste of pre-pandemic normalcy, whether it’s a trip to the salon, a carefree cookout with friends, or a night out at the theater. More challenging, people will have to maintain the discipline of social distancing until the virus is genuinely under control. It might be tantalizing to forego some of the summer’s most sought-after activities—like a trip to the beach—but the most abstemious countries will have greater rewards down the line. No doubt, those that persevere in taming the virus will claim the prize of lasting economic stability.
President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. Worse than the preschooler who succumbs to a single marshmallow, Trump would stuff his face and then smash the plate.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. Barely two weeks after declaring a national emergency in mid-March, he said he hoped to see “packed churches” by Easter and started urging the return of professional sports with full stadiums. As cases mounted a month later, Trump tweeted to “liberate” three states from lockdown restrictions, encouraging rebellions against governors’ efforts to stop the spread of infection. Then, in late May, as U.S. deaths edged toward the ominous threshold of 100,000, Trump called on churches to hold in-person services, contradicting state bans on mass gatherings, declaring them “essential.”
Consistently, he has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly hasn’t spoken to Trump in two weeks. All of these comments and actions have delayed the day when true normalcy will arrive, if not sabotaged it altogether.
For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.
Public health officials have repeatedly warned against the lifting of restrictions prematurely, especially when many states still lack the testing and contact tracing infrastructure necessary to tamp down inevitable outbreaks. Adding to these worries is the possibility of a new wave, sparked by this week’s mass protests and the gatherings over Memorial Day weekend. The worst-case scenario, scientists say, is a resurgence of the virus this fall in combination with the seasonal flu. The coming months, as ousted vaccine official Rick Bright recently told Congress, could be the “darkest winter in modern history.” Nevertheless, states are vaulting over the federal government’s metrics for a safe reopening in a race to restart their economies. As of June 3, 16 states were reporting a rise in new infections, a number that’s likely to tick upward.
Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Rather than tackle immigration reform, Trump opted for the cheap optics of “building a wall,” a colossal waste of tax-payer money. Rather than negotiate a sensible agreement with China over its unfair trade practices, he levied a series of ill-considered tariffs and set off a trade war that has put U.S.-China relations on its worst footing in decades. And instead of investing in the painstaking work of tamping down COVID-19, he’s scapegoated the World Health Organization and repeatedly touted an anti-malaria drug that doesn’t treat the disease and is now shown to increase the likelihood of death.
The next few months will pose a crucial test of our national resolve and set the country’s trajectory for years to come. Americans need a leader who is honest about the difficulties that lie ahead, undaunted by the scale of the task, and willing to do take on the arduous job of navigating the nation’s recovery. In other words, they need the exact opposite of Trump.
In his speech announcing the moon shot, President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Rebuilding a post-pandemic America will be one of the hardest tasks the nation has ever had to face. Unlike the moon shot, with its aspiration and glamour, the goal will be the simple restoration of a life with some semblance to what we had before.
Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.","['megalomania', 'impulsiveness', 'defective', 'character']"
Pompeo appeared hopelessly lost when WSMV’s Nancy Amon was far better prepared for an interview than he was.,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pompeo-confronts-simple-questions-he-just-can-t-seem-answer-n1123696,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,61.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sat down today with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, who asked whether he owes former U.S. Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch an apology. Given the latest revelations, and the way in which Pompeo's State Department forced Yovanovitch from her post under scandalous circumstances, the question was more than fair.
The nation's chief diplomat didn't seem to agree, however. He complained about the line of inquiry and complained about the Obama administration for a while, before the host narrowed the focus, asking about the State Department personnel who've resigned because of Pompeo's refusal to stand up for American diplomats. He balked, attributing the concerns to ""unnamed sources.""
Kelly wasted little time in reminding the Kansas Republican that the sources aren't unnamed at all: his own State Department senior adviser, Michael McKinley, a career Foreign Service officer with four decades experience, testified under oath about the department's failures in this area.

Pompeo said he wouldn't comment on McKinley's assessment, either, though he insisted that he's ""defended every State Department official"" since taking the reins at the cabinet agency. The NPR host, likely realizing that this claim wasn't true, pressed further on this specific point:
KELLY: Respectfully, where have you defended Marie Yovanovich? POMPEO: I've defended every single person on this team I've done what's right for every person on this team. KELLY: Can you point me towards your remarks? POMPEO: I've said all I'm going to say.
On the one hand, I'm glad to see Pompeo sit down for interviews with outlets outside the conservative media bubble. On the other hand, when the secretary of State does sit down for these interviews, they don't seem to go well.
Pompeo appeared hopelessly lost when WSMV’s Nancy Amon was far better prepared for an interview than he was. Soon after, the cabinet secretary’s interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos was every bit as cringe-worthy. Reflecting on Pompeo’s on-air comments, MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace told viewers, “That was the worst appearance by an executive branch official I’ve ever seen in my career.”
Soon after, the secretary sat down with KMUV in Wichita and threw a minor tantrum when asked to defend State Department employees against Donald Trump's attacks.
Pompeo also spoke with the Wichita Eagle in November, and that interview turned messy, too: when asked about the impact on U.S. credibility when the White House fails to honor its partnership with the Kurds, the secretary replied, ""The whole predicate of your question is insane."" (It was actually quite sane.)
As we discussed at the time, if Pompeo can’t handle some of these basic questions, why does he keep agreeing to interviews?

"When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-shows-that-christian-white-nationalism-is-a-much-greater-threat-to-the-us-than-radical-islam/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,62.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On March 15, Politico reported that according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the terrorist group ISIS — in its al Naba newsletter — was advising its members to avoid traveling to Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic and offered tips on social distancing and ways to avoid becoming infected (including frequent handwashing). ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['truthers', 'far-right', 'suicidal']"
"It's not just governments and international organizations that have lined up to express dismay at Trump's move. Experts, entrepreneurs and others have also been quick to condemn the announcement.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/global-criticism-grows-trump-move-end-who-funding-amid-pandemic-n1184146,msnbc,coronavirus,left,62.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
President Donald Trump's move to halt funding to the World Health Organization has been met with severe criticism at home and abroad, with the United Nations secretary-general saying ""now is not the time"" for such a drastic move while the coronavirus pandemic is gripping the globe.
Trump made the announcement Tuesday pending a review of the WHO's response to the initial coronavirus outbreak in China. He claims the agency has been too close to Beijing and covered up for its mistakes.
Congressional Democrats are disputing the president's authority to do this. Republican lawmakers are planning their own investigation, examining the early response by the WHO and the Chinese government.
""Now is a time for unity in the global battle to push the COVID-19 pandemic into reverse, not a time to cut the resources of the World Health Organization, which is spearheading and coordinating the global body's efforts,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement Tuesday.
China expressed ""deep concern"" about Trump's announcement, its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said at a news briefing.
""As the most authoritative and most professional organization, the World Health Organization has played an irreplaceable role in global public health crisis,"" Zhao said. ""The decision of the U.S. will undercut the ability of the WHO and damage the global cooperation of fighting the epidemic.""
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted similar misgivings.
Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to @WHO. There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain & mitigate the #coronavirus pandemic. Only by joining forces we can overcome this crisis that knows no borders. — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) April 15, 2020
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov slammed Trump’s move as ""a very selfish approach."" He told the TASS news agency, ""We urge the United States to abandon further attacks on the WHO and pursue a responsible line.""
And Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the African Union Commission, called the decision ""deeply regrettable.""

It's not just governments and international organizations that have lined up to express dismay at Trump's move. Experts, entrepreneurs and others have also been quick to condemn the announcement.
Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told his 50 million Twitter followers that halting the WHO's funding was ""as dangerous as it sounds.""
""Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped, no other organization can replace them,"" Gates tweeted. ""The world needs the WHO now more than ever.""
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Reuters, ""The move sends the wrong message during the middle of a pandemic."" While the WHO has made mistakes in the past, he added, ""it's not the middle of a pandemic that you do this type of thing.""
And Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, described Trump's move as ""a crime against humanity."" He tweeted that ""every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.""
A slew of other world leaders and senior officials lined up to express their dismay over what they said was Trump's willingness to hamper the WHO just when the world needs it the most.
The U.S. is the world's largest financial contributor to the organization, accounting for roughly 15 percent of its budget. Trump has said that amounts to some $500 million each year.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that ascribing blame ""does not help"" because ""the virus knows no borders. We have to closely work together.""
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that ""at time like this when we need to be sharing information and we need to have advice we can rely on, the WHO has provided that.""
Not everyone was quite so scathing. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he sympathized with some of Trump's criticisms of the WHO, but nevertheless said now was not the time ""to throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and hobble the agency at a time of global crisis.

Trump has accused the WHO of ""severely mismanaging and covering up"" the coronavirus crisis, specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. He also claimed that the WHO ""pushed China's misinformation about the virus ... and there was no need for travel bans.""
He took particular issue with the agency's criticism of his order to temporarily deny entry to the U.S. by most foreign nationals who had recently been in China. The order was issued Jan. 31, when China was the center of the outbreak.

The agency was informed of the first cases Dec. 31. The next day, it requested information from Chinese officials, and the Wuhan market where the outbreak is believed to have originated was closed for disinfection, according to a WHO report.
Then, on Jan. 30, it declared a global health emergency as the number of cases hit 10,000.
Trump's move to halt funding for the agency that oversees international public health has raised questions about whether it could affect efforts by other countries to curtail coronavirus cases.
Dr. Patrice Harris, the president of the American Medical Association, excoriated the president in a statement Tuesday for making the move ""during the worst public health crisis in a century.""
""Cutting funding to the WHO — rather than focusing on solutions — is a dangerous move at a precarious moment for the world,"" Harris said. ""The AMA is deeply concerned by this decision and its wide-ranging ramifications, and we strongly urge the President to reconsider.""","['dismay', 'condemn']"
"Finally, he launched into a meandering rant about Biden, suggesting that under the Obama administration, nothing was done to fix policing in the United States.

This has been a defining feature of his presidency. He’s not a learned policy wonk, understanding the complex nuances of law and governance. He is, at his core, just a former game show host and a con man.
Never is this more clear than when reporters ask him about public policy problems he’s not prepared for. (Of course, even on topics where Trump should be prepared, like health care, he struggles to put together a coherent thought.)
This happens even with friendly outlets. On Wednesday, Trump appeared with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on his radio show. And in an exchange flagged by CNN’s Daniel Dale, Kilmeade asked a surprisingly decent and provocative question.
Trump had no idea how to respond, so he just rambled. But his rambling was revealing. It’s worth quoting the entire exchange in full:
Kilmeade: But this is the one stat I’m going to bring you to, and I’m going to ask you if could attack this.
According to an Axios-Ipsos poll, 70% of white Americans say they trust the local police. Only 36% of African-
Americans do. How do you attack that problem? How do you change things? Trump: Well I think it’s a very sad problem. As you know, as a Republican I’m doing very well with African- Americans and with the vote, with the — in polls and everything — especially, I mean I haven’t seen one very recently because you had the plague come in from China, so that changed things up, but we had the best economy ever, we had the best numbers for African-American employment and unemployment in history. Best homeownership — best everything. We had the best numbers in everything — not only African-American, but the African-American numbers were great. K: But how do you handle the law enforcement part of this? How do you handle the law enforcement part of this? T: Well I think you have to get better than what they’ve been doing. I mean obviously that was a terrible thing. And I’ve spoken about it numerous times in various speeches. And you know, it’s interesting: I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket — a tremendous program that culminated on that day and obviously it goes on from there. But I then made a speech and it was a speech about the rocket, and I devoted 25% of the speech probably to what happened — or more — to what happened with respect to George — George Floyd, and it was — and then you listen to news, ‘He doesn’t talk about George Floyd.’ The rocket went off, I then I made a speech, and I talked about George Floyd, but they said he didn’t talk about George Floyd. Half — maybe even almost half of the speech, but a large portion of the speech was devoted exactly to that. And so, you know, with — with the media you basically — basically no matter what you do, it’s never going to be good enough. But the people understand it. K: Right. T: And that’s one of the beauties to social media. I mean, I would love not to even bother with social media. but
I’m able to get my word out beautifully by social media. Fortunately. You use social media too. K: Right, also — T: But we have to get the word out. Look, we have to — Brian, we have to get the police departments, everybody has to do better, has to do better. This is a long-term problem. This didn’t happen today. This happened — I mean, a guy like Sleepy Joe Biden was in there for 43 years, then he says, ‘I think we should do this’ — I saw today, he took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven’t seen his face for a long time. And he said, ‘I think we should do this,’ or ‘I think we should do that.’ And actually then he started speaking through the mask again. He feels comfortable with the mask on, I think, and — even though there was nobody anywhere near him, which is interesting. But he made a statement about what he should do. I said, he’s been there for 43 years, he was vice president for 8 years, he didn’t do a thing. His crime bill was a disaster.
When asked about African-Americans, Trump did what he normally does and began talking about the economic success the country enjoyed before the pandemic. His claiming credit for this success is highly dubious and contestable, and it was completely unrelated to the question asked. So Kilmeade asked again.
And still, Trump had nothing to say. So again, he just started talking about himself. He reverted to a comfortable topic, claiming that the media was unfair because it supposedly ignored his comments about George Floyd’s death when he appeared at NASA. But what he’s really demonstrating is that he has no ideas for how to actually address the problems the protesters are calling out. He seems to either be convinced that what he has said about Floyd should be enough to solve the problems, or he’s unable to comprehend that there are concerns about public policy that have nothing to do with him in particular.
Finally, he launched into a meandering rant about Biden, suggesting that under the Obama administration, nothing was done to fix policing in the United States. While the previous administration surely didn’t do enough, and Biden himself has contributed to the criminal justice problems in the country, Trump completely ignored the fact that the Obama Justice Department actually did take significant steps toward reform following the protests in Ferguson. Under Trump, those efforts were rolled back.","['meandering', 'rant', 'ignored']"

"We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that, but the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/alexandria-ocaio-cortez-is-absolutely-right-there-shouldnt-be-any-billionaires/,alternet,middle-class,left,63.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to harness the news cycle hasn’t died down one bit now that the newly-elected New York congresswoman has settled into office. Most of the AOC coverage over the past week continues to be TMZ-ified, focusing on Aaron Sorkin’s stuffed-shirt scolding of younger members of Congress and exaggerating Ocasio-Cortez’s supposed conflict with other Democrats.
The congressional freshman from the Bronx continues to calmly and unapologetically use her fame for good, however. She used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.
On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez attended a symposium where author Ta-Nehisi Coates asked her if it was moral to have “a world that allows for billionaires.” Ocasio-Cortez swiftly said it was not. She hastened to note that individual billionaires, such as Bill Gates, may well be good people. But “a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.”
AOC continued to hammer this point home later the same night on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, explaining (yet again) that her proposed 70 percent marginal income tax rate would only be on money made above the first $10 million a year — and that a similar marginal tax rate reached 90% when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
“Do we want to live in a city where billionaires have their own personal Uber helipads,” she asked, “in the same city and same society as people who are working 80-hour weeks and can’t feed their kids?”
Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.
On his own, the barely literate imbecile with no redeeming qualities who sits in the Oval Office claiming to be a billionaire (even if he probably isn’t) creates a one-man argument against the premise that wealth flows from merit. But the numbers increasingly back up Ocasio-Cortez’s argument that our system unjustly concentrating massive amounts of wealth in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of society with little to show for all their hard work and social contributions.
On Monday, Oxfam published a report showing that a mere 26 individual billionaires now have as much wealth between them as the least wealthy half of the human population. Which is to say, these 26 people have more money combined than 3.8 billion of the world’s population.
The idea that those 26 people are somehow being fairly rewarded by that massively unequal equation defies all common sense, especially as most billionaires have built their wealth on the labor of people who only take home a fraction of the value they add to the companies they work for.
It’s not just a matter of sour grapes. The billionaires saw their wealth rise by 12 percent in one year — the same year that saw the poorest half of the population lose 11 percent of their wealth, a loss that people who are already struggling to afford food, shelter and basic necessities simply cannot tolerate.
It’s not just that there seems to be a direct correlation between how much money the rich make and how little everyone else gets. There’s also evidence that vast inequalities stifle economic growth, and that redistribution of the sort that Ocasio-Cortez proposes can kickstart the economy. Money in the hands of working people is spent, and stimulates the economy, much more than money being hoarded by the wealthy few, after all. Inequality also breeds crime and other forms of social instability.
But mostly, this is a moral issue, and one of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarkable gifts as a communicator is her ability to speak about this issue in moral terms. Most people, of all wealth and income levels are hard workers. The fact that only a select few are amply rewarded while most others go wanting is both unfair and immoral. And the worse the problem gets, the more unavoidable this unfairness becomes.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. This includes a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.
The problem conservatives must face is that the very inequality they are defending is a rhetorical obstacle in itself. Most people recognize that it’s unfair that rich people make so much more money than the rest of us, and does not necessarily prove they have worked harder. Getting people to sign off on the idea that they simply are less worthy than their wealthier fellow citizens is not an easy lift, which is why Republicans prefer to stick to culture-war distractions, like fear-mongering over immigration or abortion.
Since Ocasio-Cortez first mentioned the 70 percent tax rate on CNN, a number of mansplaining journalists have written harrumphing pieces explaining that the “real” problem is tax loopholes or capital-gains tax rates set too low. This approach fails to understand the nature and purpose of Ocasio-Cortez’s political rhetoric. Any tax plan that raised marginal rates that high would almost certainly have other provisions to close loopholes or tax investments more fairly. But before we can get to that point, there must be more political momentum to change the tax system.
By focusing on marginal tax rates — which are easier to explain to the general public than most other taxation strategies — Ocasio-Cortez can help build a moral and social argument against economic inequality. Blunt statements, like saying that it’s immoral that billionaires exist at all, can help people reimagine a world where resources are distributed more equitably and ordinary people who work hard and drive economic growth can see their effort reflected in their paychecks.
Because the truth of the matter is that she’s right: We shouldn’t have billionaires. Any system that has a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals, by definition, is not rewarding hard work and social contributions fairly, or anywhere close to it. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that. But the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. Most people know that’s true, whatever their official “politics” may be, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny it.",['embrace']
"It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/follow-the-money-gop-senators-are-making-millions-off-trumps-tax-cuts-and-will-repay-him-by-betraying-their-oath/,alternet,middle-class,left,63.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"It’s long been obvious that Republican senators have little interest in serving as impartial jurors in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. While there is a raft of motivations for such historic perfidy — with several GOP senators politically benefiting from some of the same corrupting influences — one under-examined, non-Russian reason is personal greed.
A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. According to a Center for Public Integrity analysis, several Republican members of Congress directly cashed in on the multibillion-dollar windfall from the corporate tax cuts the GOP pushed through on a party-line vote. With the lowest effective tax rate in the last 40 years, America’s largest corporations proceeded to pour $1 trillion not into increased wages for workers but buybacks of their own stocks, causing stock prices to soar. Coincidentally, many Republican lawmakers who voted for the largest tax cut signed into law by Trump personally owned some of the same stocks whose values significantly increased as a result.
At least seven Republican senators owned stocks in companies that spent billions on buybacks, resulting in great personal profit, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The report came on the same day that former New York Rep. Chris Collins, who was the first sitting GOP congressman to support Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading.
It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives. Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate. With that, Trump’s fate in a Senate impeachment trial was all but sealed.
While the report is a less than shocking look into the kleptocratic ways of the modern GOP, it shows that the transactional core of the 2017 tax cuts has ramifications far beyond the $1.8 trillion increase in the national debt. Republican senators in purple states, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and David Perdue of Georgia, have personally reaped hundreds of millions from the tax law and are repaying the president by serving as his impeachment propaganda machine rather than impartial jurors — even as half of registered voters and a majority of independents in a Fox News poll released on Sunday said the Senate should convict Trump.
Now, in addition to running defense for Trump, McConnell’s repeating Trump’s empty promises of a middle-class tax cut in an election year.
“We’re talking a fairly substantial … middle-class tax cut that’ll be subject to taking back the House and obviously keeping the Senate and keeping the White House,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week. He promised a plan would be revealed in 90 days.
Before the 2018 midterms, Trump actually admitted that his tax bill was never aimed at cutting middle-class taxes, promising to actually deliver in 2019. “We’re putting in a resolution some time in the next week and a half to two weeks [and] we’re giving a middle-income tax reduction of about 10 percent,” Trump told reporters at the time.
The first Republican rule of “middle-class tax cuts” is to speak about them but never actually pass them. They’ve been pulling the same bait-and-switch since at least 1980. But while they were cutting taxes for the rich and corporations, the GOP left in place the income taxes a majority of seniors pay on their Social Security income. Now they are again touting cuts to Medicare and Social Security to cover the payoff they gave to themselves.
“The president directed me to produce what we’re calling tax cuts 2.0,” senior White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow explained last week. “It will be published sometime during the campaign, as a message for future Trump economic growth policies, [with] particular emphasis on the middle class, in his second term. … We are looking at a variety of tax cuts, sometimes making permanent some existing tax cuts, some existing corporate tax cuts.”
That last part gives the game away. The promise of continued corporate tax cuts is how Trump builds his 2020 election war chest from the super-rich and buys the continued allegiance of Republican impeachment jurors, even in the face of ever more damning evidence of his public corruption.

"It may have taken Trump to point out the pitfalls of the Chimerica link, but coming up with a coherent strategy to replace it is clearly beyond the president’s abilities.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/trump-is-incapable-of-fixing-relations-with-china-and-his-trade-war-is-likely-to-grow-more-destructive/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,63.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"“Chimerica” is a term originally coined by the historian Niall Ferguson and economist Moritz Schularick to describe the growing economic relationship between the U.S. and China since the latter’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. In the words of Ferguson: “The Chinese did the saving, the Americans the spending. The Chinese did the exporting, the Americans the importing. The Chinese did the lending, the Americans the borrowing.” Much of the pre-crisis boom in global trade was driven by this economic symbiosis, which is why successive American presidents tolerated this marriage of convenience despite the increasing costs to the U.S. economy. The net benefits calculation, however, began to change after 2008, and the conflict has intensified further after the 2016 presidential election result. Today, the cumulative stress of Donald Trump’s escalating trade war is leading to if not an irreparable breach between the two countries, then certainly a significant fraying. The imminent resumption of trade talks notwithstanding, the rising cost of the tariffs is already inducing some U.S. manufacturers to exit China. But in most instances, they are not returning to home shores.
It may have taken Trump to point out the pitfalls of the Chimerica link, but coming up with a coherent strategy to replace it is clearly beyond the president’s abilities. America is likely to remain a relative manufacturing wasteland, as barren as Trump’s own ill-conceived ideas on trade. At the same time, it’s not going to be an unmitigated victory for China either, as Beijing is increasingly suffering from a large confluence of internal and external pressures.
Chimerica helped to launch China as a global trade power. To the extent that this marriage helped the U.S. economy, it skewed toward the largely blue state coastal regions. Wall Street banks located on the East Coast happily collected lucrative commissions and investment banking fees, as China’s export proceeds were recycled into U.S. treasuries, stocks, and high-end real estate while the capital markets boomed; on the West Coast, “new economy” companies thrived, their growth and profitability unhindered by the onslaught of Chinese manufactured exports. By contrast, facilitated by technological advances that permitted large-scale outsourcing by U.S. manufacturers, Chimerica laid waste to much of what was left of America’s Rust Belt, and the politics of many of the displaced workers mutated to the extent that Donald Trump became an appealing alternative to the establishment in 2016.
The major legacy of Chimerica, then, is that too many American workers have been semi-permanently replaced by low-cost offshored labor. Prior to great advances in technology, along with globalization, displacement of the current labor force could only have occurred through immigration of workers into the country. Historically, displacement by immigrants generally began at the menial level of the labor force, and became more restrictive as when it became correlated with significant unemployment. Given the rise of globalization and the corresponding liberalization of immigration in the past few decades, however, policy no longer arrests the displacement of American workers. The policy backlash has consequently manifested itself more via trade protectionism. Trump has sought to consolidate his Rust Belt base of supporters by launching a trade war, especially versus Beijing, the ultimate effects of which he hoped would be to re-domicile supply chains that had earlier migrated to China.
Early on in his presidency, there was some hope that Trump’s protectionism was at best a bluff or, at worst, an aberration, and that the return of a Democrat to the White House in 2020 would eventually reestablish the status quo ante. But the president still can’t get a wall, and his protectionism has become more pronounced almost as if to compensate. The problem today is that even if Trump is voted out of office in 2020, corporate America is becoming less inclined to wait out the end of his presidency to return to the pre-Trump status quo of parking the bulk of their manufacturing in China. There is too much risk in putting all of one’s eggs in the China basket, especially given growing national security concerns. Hence, U.S. companies are taking action. In spite of decades of investment in these China-domiciled supply chains, a number of American companies are pulling out: toy manufacturer Hasbro, Illinois-based phone accessories manufacturer Xentris Wireless, and lifestyle clothing company PacSun are a few of the operators who are exiting the country.
But they are not coming back to the U.S., relocating instead to places like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mexico, the Philippines and Taiwan. The chief financial officer of Xentris, Ben Buttolph, says that the company will never return to China: “We are trying to have multiple locations certified for all of our products, so that if all of a sudden there’s an issue with one of the locations, we just flip the switch.” Likewise, the CEO of Hasbro, Brian Goldner, recently spoke of “great opportunities in Vietnam, India and other territories like Mexico.”
All is not lost for the U.S., however, as Goldner did celebrate the success of Hasbro’s facility in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, which has resumed production of Play-Doh in the U.S. for the first time since 2004. It is doubtful, however, that this represents the recapturing of the high value-added supply chains that Trump envisaged when he first launched his trade assault on Beijing.
In general, as Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, writes: “United States industry is losing ground to foreign competitors on price, quality and technology. In many areas, our manufacturing capacity cannot compete with what exists in Asia.”
These are not isolated examples. Defense One also notes the following development:
“It came without a breaking news alert or presidential tweet, but the technological competition with China entered a new phase last month. Several developments quietly heralded this shift: Cross-border investments between the United States and China plunged to their lowest levels since 2014, with the tech sector suffering the most precipitous drop. U.S. chip giants Intel and AMD abruptly ended or declined to extend important partnerships with Chinese entities. The Department of Commerce halved the number of licenses that let U.S. companies assign Chinese nationals to sensitive technology and engineering projects.”
This development consequently makes it hard to proclaim Beijing a winner in this dispute either. The country still needs access to U.S. high tech. The government announced yet another fiscal stimulus to the economy earlier this month in response to a cluster of weakening economic data, much of which is related to the trade shock. It is also the case that China is being buffeted politically, both externally and internally: externally, in addition to the escalating trade war, China’s own efforts to counter the effects of rising protectionism by creating a “reverse Marshall Plan” via the Belt and Road Initiative is floundering. China’s “iron brother,” Pakistan, is increasingly being victimized by India’s aggressive Hindu-centric nationalism. It is hard to imagine the Modi government opportunistically taking the step of annexing Kashmir and undermining Pakistan, had it not sensed Beijing’s increasing vulnerability.
Internally, Beijing is finding it increasingly challenging as it seeks to enforce its “One China” policy in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The withdrawal of the controversial extradition law that first precipitated widespread demonstrations in Hong Kong has not alleviated the political pressures in the territory, but simply allowed an even bigger protest culture to take root and strengthen an independent political mindset. Similarly, Taiwan has also openly supported the Hong Kong protesters, pledging help to those seeking asylum. Both regions now constitute both a huge humiliation and challenge to the primacy of China’s ruling Communist Party. And now on top of that, foreign manufacturers are leaving the country, weakening a totally leveraged manufacturing complex.
The implications of this divorce go well beyond the U.S. and China. They constitute another step toward regionalization, another step away from a quaint ideological “post-history” construct that saw Washington, D.C., as the head office and the rest of the world as a bunch of branch plants for “America, Inc.” It’s hardly comforting to contemplate that the last time we reached this historic juncture was the early 1900s, when a similarly globalized economy broke down, followed by the Great War. As Niall Ferguson points out, “a high level of economic integration does not necessarily prevent the growth of strategic rivalry and, ultimately, conflict.” There’s no doubt that both Washington and Beijing will likely make soothing noises to the markets in order to create favorable conditions for the trade talks in October, but their actions suggest that they are both digging in for a longer struggle. Today’s trade wars, therefore, are likely to morph into something more destructive, which is a lose-lose in an era where human advancement depends on greater integration between economic powers.

"Women in power must pay a significant tax on their limited time to sit for manicures, blowouts, brow waxes, and braids, rather than meeting with constituents, reviewing legislation, conducting investigations, chasing a story, traveling to their districts, reviewing their notes, or spending time with their families.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/the-real-scandal-behind-aocs-haircut/,alternet,gender,left,63.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Hair toss, check my nails.” So begins Lizzo’s blockbuster song “Good as Hell,” which sells a dizzying idea of female empowerment. With its iconic rhythm and feel-good sentiment, “Good as Hell” has had tremendous success resonating with young girls, sorority sisters, and dance club frequenters, to even middle-aged white moms like me. But on Thursday, I heard the song scratch to a halt in the back of my mind upon reading a Washington Times story by Alex Swoyer entitled “EXCLUSIVE: Self-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.”
In her piece, Ms. Swoyer seeks to shine a light on the purported hypocrisy of a congresswoman who declares herself a socialist but spends hundreds of dollars on her hair. But in her rush for snarky liberal-bashing, Swoyer misses the real story about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s pricey haircut: the blatant and disparate “female tax” that women in power must pay to achieve and maintain their power.
Swoyer calculates that, in a Washington, D.C. hair salon, AOC likely spent, with gratuity, more than $300 to get her hair cut and colored. The math looks correct. (I say that as someone who got her hair cut and colored in D.C. Thursday for a similarly outrageous amount of money in a different hair salon.) Swoyer suggests that AOC could have spent a mere $100 for the “same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop” where men’s cuts cost about $20.
And that is where Swoyer misses the real story. AOC, like all powerful women, has to go through a rigorous beauty regimen simply to exist in the public eye. Picture Laura Ingraham, Kellyanne Conway, Andrea Mitchell, Nicole Wallace, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, Dana Bash, Susan Collins, and Jeanine Pirro.
The beauty routine for prominent women who work and live under the eye of a camera can include not just haircuts, but hair color, highlights, lowlights, Keratin treatments, blowouts, braids, manicures, pedicures, facials, eyebrow waxes, eyelash extensions. In some cases, it may include Botox and plastic surgery. Not to mention, women operating in the public eye often maintain one to two sets of makeup (one for home and one for the office) which consists of products like foundation, mascara, lipstick, all the brushes and utensils to apply makeup with, and much more. These costs add up to hundreds, in some cases thousands, of dollars a year.
On top of the enormous financial impact, these beauty regimens require these women to take the time out of their busy schedules to attend to their appearances in a way that men in power are spared. Women in power must pay a significant tax on their limited time to sit for manicures, blowouts, brow waxes, and braids, rather than meeting with constituents, reviewing legislation, conducting investigations, chasing a story, traveling to their districts, reviewing their notes, or spending time with their families.
The story about AOC’s haircut is the story about how women continue to face enormous—and often superficially imposed—obstacles to achieving power and influence. Women in power must be more than mentally prepared for work, knowledgeable of the issues, ready to defend themselves and their work on a moment’s notice, and braced to fend off sexism and harassment.
Twenty-dollar barbershop haircuts, a shower, and a shave simply won’t suffice—nor will a mere hair toss and checking your nails. That’s a very real cost for women in powerful positions. It is not, as Lizzo might say, “good as hell.” And that is the scandal behind haircut-gate.

Conservatives claim that we can either contain the COVID-19 pandemic or start getting everyone back to work, but that’s a false choice. Because we still lack the capacity to test widely and isolate the infected, the choice before us is to reopen prematurely, worsening the public health crisis and deepening the recession, or waiting until we have the ability to reopen safely, in stages, which would both save lives and lead to a quicker recovery. We know these are our options from past pandemics.
The Trump regime appears to have given up on containing the outbreak and is just focusing on managing the political fallout. This week, the White House rejected its own sensible, science-based guidelines to re-open states, and Trump has left it up to governors to decide how and when to reopen their economies.
They are taking divergent paths. A number of Republican governors are pushing ahead against the advice of public health experts, and those states are all-but-guaranteed to see a spike in infections and will likely have a rockier economic road ahead of them as a result.
At the same time, a number of governors, mostly in blue states, have insisted on an evidence-based approach to reopening as soon as it’s relatively safe to do so. Last week, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown “unveiled a bevy of new initiatives and details to beef up testing and contact tracing as businesses look to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic,” according to The Oregonian. On Monday, Andrew Cuomo offered a “soft blueprint” for getting New York up and running. That same day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the Golden State was moving to the first phase of its plan to ease restrictions, and will move to the second phase next week.
And yesterday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, dubbed “that woman from Michigan” by Donald Trump, issued what may be the most straightforward and easy-to-understand benchmarks for getting people back to work.
All of these approaches–including the White House’s guidelines that Trump’s team ditched this week–are broadly similar because they reflect what epidemiologists know so far about how this novel disease operates. But clear communication to the public, something that has been notably lacking from the federal government, is essential for managing a pandemic because people are more likely to comply with restrictions when they understand the rationale for them and see that there’s a plan in place to end them as soon as it can be done responsibly. In that sense, Whitmer’s simple, 6-step framework represents a model of clarity that other leaders might emulate.","['sensible', 'given', 'up', 'regime', 'fallout']"

"In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is whispering in the ear of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.)",https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/how-secret-israeli-attacks-in-iraq-are-driving-trumps-anti-iran-campaign/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,64.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, notes former CIA analyst Paul Pillar, is more obsession than strategy, and a not-so-mysterious explosion on the outskirts of Baghdad Monday shows why.
Iraqi political analysts are blaming the attack on Israel, saying it follows two attacks earlier this month on facilities of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. According to an Israeli news report, Israel launched the two attacks with U.S.-made F-35 jets.
Israel has long attacked Iranian-backed forces in Syria, an enemy of the United States. Now Israel has expanded its scope of operations to attack targets in Iraq, whose coalition government is friendly to the United States. The predictable result: the Iraqi government is bailing on Trump’s policy.
The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region. When things go wrong, a strategy can be rethought. An obsession can only ignore the warning signs.
The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen that was supposed to check Iran’s power is now in disarray. The bloody war that Trump continued, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is farther than ever from success.
The U.S.-backed Yemen war is losing allies, even among the Persian Gulf states that fear Iran. First, the United Arab Emirates announced it is now bailing out of the Yemen war effort. Then, separatist Yemeni forces, backed by the UAE, took the southern port city of Aden from the Saudi-backed forces. Saudi Arabia is now fighting another war in Yemen that has nothing to do with Iran. It’s a maximum mess.
In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is whispering in the ear of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.) Last month Germany refused to join a U.S.-led naval mission to the Persian Gulf aimed at deterring Iranian attacks, saying everything should be done to avoid escalation sought by Washington.
When it comes to “maximum pressure,” the international reaction is: “include me out”—except in Israel, and therein lies the danger for the U.S. government and the American people. Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran.
Iran is growing stronger across the region and in Iraq in particular. Since last summer Iran has been delivering of short and medium range ballistic missiles to the PMUs. If fired from southern and western Iraq, these missiles could reach Riyadh and possibly Tel Aviv. They are Iran’s main deterrent to a U.S.-Israeli-Saudi attack and thus a threat to Israeli freedom of action in the region.
“The logic was to have a backup plan if Iran was attacked,” an Iranian official told Reuters. “The number of missiles is not high, just a couple of dozen, but it can be increased if necessary.”
Since January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pressured the Iraqi government to order the dissolution of the Iranian-sponsored Popular Mobilization Units. The PMUs, as they are known, are the Shia militias that led a successful fight to drive ISIS out of western Iraq in 2017. They are Iraqi versions of Hezbollah combining Iranian-trained military forces with political fronts. (The bombings attributed to Israelis all targeted PMU facilities.)
The PMUs are controversial in Iraq. While hailed for their role in fighting ISIS, their subsequent expansion into domestic politics was not. Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the nation’s religious leader, blessed the PMUs’ war on ISIS with a fatwa in 2014 but openly opposed their electoral list in 2018.
Nonetheless, the PMUs’ political alliance, known as Fateh, finished second in Iran’s 2018 parliamentary election and helped select Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. According to Iranian news reports, Pompeo made it clear in a January meeting with Abdul-Mahdi that Washington would not react to Israeli attacks against the PMUs.
As Iraq incorporates the PMUs—and there are more than 40 of them—into its armed forces, Iran is bolstering their independence. During the recent meeting in Tehran, a spokesman for one PMU, the Hezbollah al-Nujaba Movement, said any government in Iraq that stands against Iran will be overthrown in a matter of weeks.
That threat is overstated, but the influence of the PMUs is not. They helped save the country when ISIS erupted in 2014. They wield “significant political and military power,” according to the Jamestown Foundation, a security think tank that is hostile to Iran. Despite Pompeo’s pressure, their dissolution is “quite unlikely.”
Thanks to Trump’s policy, the incentives for Iraq to side with Iran are growing. No Iraqi government can afford to be seen making common cause with Israel. When Israel announced last week it would join a U.S. coalition to protect Persian Gulf maritime traffic, the pro-American government in Iraq spurned the idea. Iraq “rejects any participation of forces of the Zionist entity in any military force to secure passage of ships in the Arabian Gulf,” said Foreign Minister Mohammed Ali al-Hakim.
“Iraq will work to lower tensions in our region through calm negotiations,” al-Hakim said, while “the presence of Western forces in the region would raise tensions.” As a result of Trump’s “maximum pressure,” Iraq had adopted the message of the U.S.-sanctioned Iranian diplomat Javad Zarif: the U.S. campaign against Iran is a menace, and “only regional nations can make regional peace.”
The U.S. alliance with Israel comes with a high political price that Trump appears willing to pay. The secret attacks may enhance Israeli security; they also serve to isolate Washington from its Iraqi allies. The attacks may degrade Iran militarily; they also bolster Iran’s standing politically. They may make Israelis nominally safer. They also make the remaining 5,200-plus U.S. troops in Iraq more vulnerable.
In short, the secret Israeli attacks increase the chances that any U.S.-Iran war will be fought in Iraq, where the U.S. intervention proved to be a disaster 15 years ago. And there’s no reason to think the Israeli attacks won’t continue.

"In Tuesday night's debate, the two progressive senators de-escalated a tense round of tit-for-tat exchanges between their presidential campaigns over the charged issues of gender and electability.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/warren-sanders-de-escalate-campaign-feud-over-contested-remark-n1115881?cid=public-rss_20200115,msnbc,gender,left,64.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The nonaggression pact between Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts faced its most difficult test and seemed to hold — at least for now.
In Tuesday night's debate, the two progressive senators de-escalated a tense round of tit-for-tat exchanges between their presidential campaigns over the charged issues of gender and electability.
But an icy moment at the end of the debate, when Warren appeared to refuse Sanders' handshake, suggests the wound may not have healed yet, even if both campaigns believe it is in their strategic interest to strike a detente.
Aides and supporters of both senators, who have more or less remained allies even while running against each other for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, had accused each other of dirty tricks and lying in recent days after a series of leaks to the media, culminating in Warren saying in a statement that Sanders once told her he didn't think a woman could win the presidency.
But when the topic came up Tuesday night, both sought to set the issue aside and move on, even as Sanders again denied telling Warren a woman couldn't win during a one-on-one meeting in 2018.
""I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want,"" he said. ""Anybody knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be president of the United States.""
He went on to say that he had been ready to defer to Warren and not run for president if she had decided to do so in 2016, and said he would work to elect any of the candidates on stage should he fail to win the nomination this year.

Warren seemed happy to move on from Sanders, but acknowledged that many Democrats have serious doubts about whether Americans would elect a woman after Hillary Clinton's 2016 electoral college loss to President Donald Trump.
""I disagreed,"" Warren said of her thoughts on their reported 2018 discussion. “Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But, look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head on. And I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record. So, can a woman beat Donald Trump?""
The issue of electability — an unknowable factor — has chased Warren since her first trip to Iowa just over a year ago as she has worked to persuade Democratic voters she can win against Trump. Many Democratic voters have said they believe that sexism does makes it harder for women to win than for men.
Warren's campaign is well aware of this challenge and has tried to find moments to push back on it, so Warren seemed happy on Tuesday to turn the Sanders spat into a chance to make the pitch herself.
Warren noted that the men on stage had collectively lost 10 elections while the two women — herself and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — had won every election.
""And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me,"" Warren added, referring to her 2012 victory over Republican Scott Brown, who won a special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy's Senate seat.
Sanders pushed back on that claim, saying he wanted to ""set the record straight"" by noting he ousted an incumbent Republican to win a seat in Congress in 1990.
Warren smirked, before gently noting that she placed her timeline within 30 years. Sanders’ 1990 election is months short of being 30 years ago.
""Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact,"" he conceded.
And Warren took one more chance to try to dispel electability concerns, pointing out that many Democrats worried Americans wouldn't elect a Roman Catholic when the party nominated John F. Kennedy in 1960 and a black man in 2008 when its voters picked Barack Obama. And she noted that women helped power Democrats' House takeover in 2018.
The episode has been personal for both camps.
Sanders' team feels he has been unfairly and inaccurately accused of sexism while Warren's allies took special offense to Sanders' campaign manager going on TV to say her recollection of events was a ""lie.""
That tension seemed evident between the candidates themselves after the debate concluded and Sanders crossed the stage to try to shake Warren's hand. She moved her hand away, and then told him something, which was not picked up on the microphones and which both campaigns have so far declined to reveal.
Another candidate, billionaire Tom Steyer, happened to be standing nearby during the awkward moment, but wanted no part of the drama when asked about it later by MSNBC's Chris Matthews.
""I don’t know what they were saying,” he said. “Whatever was going on I was trying to get out of the way as fast as possible.”","['tense', 'tit-for-tat', 'charged']"
"During that address, Lindell, a former drug addict turned born-again Christian who has donated more than $200,000 to Trump’s election efforts, went off-script, proclaiming to the nation that Trump had been “chosen by God.”",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/mypillow-ceo-mike-lindell-expands-from-manufacturing-masks-to-sourcing-them-after-call-with-trump/,alternet,coronavirus,left,64.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Mike Lindell, the founder of the MyPillow Company, has made good on his Rose Garden promise to produce and distribute medical masks to healthcare facilities around the country, a spokeswoman told Salon.
But in what would appear to be a previously-unannounced dimension to the operation, Lindell is also apparently “sourcing” masks, the spokeswoman said.
The CEO has allegedly converted more than 75% of his company’s pillow production capacity since he first announced the program in late March on national TV during a presidential Rose Garden pandemic response briefing at the request of President Donald Trump.
During that address, Lindell, a former drug addict turned born-again Christian who has donated more than $200,000 to Trump’s election efforts, went off-script, proclaiming to the nation that Trump had been “chosen by God.”
“God gave us grace on Nov. 8, 2016, to change the course we were on,” Lindell said, a reference to Trump’s election. “Taken out of our schools and lives, a nation had turned its back on God.”
In a later interview with the Epoch Times, Lindell explained how he ramped up the production process, calling MyPillow’s serendipitous fitness for the job a “blessing.”
“We had to make sure we had the right fabric,” he said. “It was a blessing. The MyPillow fabric was perfect for it. We just had to not do two processes of printing. So we had to do a different process, but not a big switch. Had to get the right elastic.”
However, Lindell’s production facilities were not, and according to his spokeswoman, are still not equipped to make masks that meet FDA standards, such as the high-demand N95 respirators. That, she said, is the reason Lindell began to look elsewhere.
“Mike was getting requests from healthcare facilities for other kinds of masks that obviously MyPillow can’t make,” she said, explaining why Lindell started his parallel operation: Procuring and selling FDA-approved masks, including the N95, to healthcare facilities.
She did not know how those facilities use the MyPillow brand cloth masks, which do not have FDA approval, though healthcare providers have purchased them.
Lindell claims to have made good on his stated goal of 50,000 masks a day, but some details remain unclear.
First, this is not a charity effort: Lindell is selling those 50,000 daily masks to U.S. healthcare facilities, which includes a mix of public and private hospitals and nursing homes. The spokeswoman would not disclose the names of the facilities or of the additional sources Lindell tapped, though a report favorable to Lindell strongly suggested overseas connections.
The spokeswoman also declined to divulge financial information. However, if Lindell has not ramped up production further and is selling 50,000 masks each day, the specialty project would by now have generated close to three million dollars in sales, assuming weekday production and a low-price point of $2.00 a mask.
N95 market prices often run much higher . Lindell’s sales volume for those products is unknown.
Lindell has also reportedly assembled a full-on task force, spearheaded by former NFL safety Jack Brewer, one of a handful of Trump’s outspoken black supporters. During a White House roundtable convened to honor Black History Month this February, Brewer, an ordained minister who supported former Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, called Trump “the first black president.”
“Every time I go into those prisons, and I ask my guys how many of them had their sentences reduced and they raise their hands, I know I’m doing God’s work,” he said. “And I thank you for that.”
The remark likely referred to Toni Morrison’s famous 1998 quip that former President Bill Clinton was “our first black president.”
Brewer confirmed he led Lindell’s task force and said he was busy sourcing equipment and coordinating logistics. He declined to comment further, citing concerns about looming stories in the press and referring questions back to MyPillow’s office.
“Media folks have been poking around trying to do negative stories,” Brewer explained. “I just want to keep doing what I can to help people.”
“Mike talks about the Bible,” he added. “There’s some satanic things coming out.”
The Trump administration has taken near-constant fire for its failed efforts to patch up a grievous shortage of medical masks as coronavirus infections broke across the country. This includes confusion over guidance on whether members of the public should wear masks, and if so, what kind. This confusion coincided with a mask shortfall, which itself coincided with a spike in cases concentrated mainly around New York and New Orleans.
That also coincided with the Rose Garden briefing, and a push to enlist private sector companies such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom — and MyPillow — in a national production effort to make deliver millions of masks to Americans through the U.S. Postal Service. The project was ultimately scrapped, but Lindell is apparently still producing.
The administration last month awarded a mask procurement contract worth eight times the going rate to a bankrupt company with no employees and no mask-making experience. Now shadow task force coordinator Jared Kushner’s botched operations are the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed with the House Oversight Committee.
The complaint includes allegations of favoritism to Trump loyalists, such as for a request from Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro to deliver large shipments of masks to an unnamed New York hospital. Kushner has reportedly moved on from the mask game to captain a White House task force dedicated to shepherding a vaccine, through collaboration with the private sector.
Lindell, for his part, is apparently focused on the future, assessing demand for specialty products that are not currently manufactured in the U.S. His factories have staggered shifts and breaks and implemented other social distancing measures, but they have not scaled back production, according to his spokeswoman.","['drug', 'addict', 'off-script']"
"While the workaday majority of Americans continue to be mired in our low-wage economy, the precious few at the tippy top soared out of sight in 2019.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/here-are-the-dirty-secrets-of-how-the-rich-become-the-uber-rich/,alternet,middle-class,left,64.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"As Ray Charles wailed in a song of true-life blues, “(T)hem that’s got are them that gets/ And I ain’t got nothin’ yet.”
While the workaday majority of Americans continue to be mired in our low-wage economy, the precious few at the tippy top soared out of sight in 2019. They started the year wallowing in wealth — and the more they had, the more they got. As tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, by year’s end, the 500 richest people saw their total haul jump by 25 percent, with $1.2 trillion added to their collective net worth! Indeed, the wealth of the wealthiest is growing so large so fast that a new category of ultra-richness has been coined: “centibillionaires,” those who have amassed more than $100 billion.
Mark Zuckerberg, the ethically challenged jefe of Facebook, is one of them, and he piled up and extra $27 billion in personal wealth last year. Bill Gates of Microsoft added $22 billion to his stash. And even though Amazon czar Jeff Bezos dropped $9 billion last year in a divorce settlement, his fortune multiplied so much that he’s still the world’s richest person.
Bear in mind that none of these moneyed elites did anything to earn these extraordinary bonanzas. They didn’t work any harder, didn’t get smarter, didn’t add anything of value to society. They simply reclined in luxury and let their money make money. That’s a dirty little secret of our rigged economic system: Unfettered inequality begets ever-expanding inequality.
Another dirty little secret is that billionaire-ism and centibillionaire-ism are hereditary. Right-wing media baron Rupert Murdoch, for example, saw his enormous level of riches fall by $10 billion in 2019 but only because he doled out that wad of wealth to his six children. So, voila! Thus were born six brand-spanking-new baby billionaires who did nothing to reach the top of the world’s financial heap except please Daddy.
Not only are the rich different from you and me but they’re also different from the filthy rich. It can take hard work, creativity, perseverance and luck to become a millionaire, but in today’s skewed wealth system, multibillionaires don’t need any of that — their money does all the work to lift them above everyone else.
I’m guessing that being rich is a comfortable feeling — no money worries; you’re set for life!
But is it possible that too rich can be too much, even discombobulating? Imagine being Mark Zuckerberg, who has become richer than Croesus by amalgamating vast troves of nearly everyone’s personal data and then using it piecemeal for global corporations, governments, political groups and who knows who else through his Facebook social media monopoly. Last year, his mass peddling of our privacy put another $27.3 billion in his pocket.
Imagine. On top of already having billions of bucks tucked away, suddenly, in a single year, here comes 27.3 more gushing into your treasury. Forget fundamental questions about whether you (or anyone) are worthy of such an excessive haul of the world’s wealth. How do you spend it? Mansions, yachts, jets, jewels, your personal island and other trinkets barely dent your multibillionous windfall. Funding political front groups and financing corporate-friendly candidates takes a little chunk of your change, as do some charity donations. And since the Trumpeteers slashed taxes for the corporate rich, far less of your extraordinarily good fortune is diverted to public need and America’s common good.
Thus, the bulk of your booty goes to making you even richer! You buy out other corporations and advanced technologies, and you dump billions into Wall Street, intentionally and artificially jacking up the price of stocks you own. Your wealth expands exponentially; inequality spreads further and faster; and the egalitarian ideals that hold our huge, diverse society together are stretched to the breaking point.
Interestingly, more and more of the uber-rich are comprehending the ultimate consequences of such extreme selfishness, so they’re responding with extreme consumerism. Specifically, they’ve created a boom in the sale of maximum-security, James Bond-ish armored vehicles. Priced in the half-million-dollar range, these rolling fortresses can come with 700 horsepower engines, tailpipe-to-grille anti-blast protection, door handles that can electrocute intruders, roof-mounted gun turrets and room for 10 fully equipped bodyguards.
With names like Marauder and Black Shark, these armored beasts have become the preferred rides of gabillionaires — not to flaunt their fortunes but to fend off the masses they’ve ripped off.

"Even if you don’t speak white nationalist dog whistle, this speech is pretty shocking. Hawley is claiming that the United States is run, and has been run, by a secret group of international “elites” who value terrible things—such as education, achievement, and progress.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/this-dark-new-event-revealed-that-americas-white-nationalism-problem-goes-far-beyond-trump/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,65.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Recently, Republicans have demonstrated a huge amount of concern over the idea that there might be someone in Congress who holds anti-Semitic views. Someone suggesting that Jewish Americans have divided loyalties. And it turns out this concern is very well-founded … as demonstrated ably by Missouri Republican Josh Hawley.
Hawley might be somewhat familiar from his appearances during some recent hearings. Or his claims that Google returns liberal results. Or his statements during the Barr hearing that showed Hawley believes some genuinely bizarre conspiracy theories. But it was Hawley’s keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference that nailed down who he is, what he believes, and where his party is going in a way that should be absolutely terrifying for every American.
Here’s part of that address:
For years the politics of both Left and Right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities. This class lives in the United States, but they identify as ‘citizens of the world.’ They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community. And they subscribe to a set of values held by similar elites in other places: things like the importance of global integration and the danger of national loyalties; the priority of social change over tradition, career over community, and achievement and merit and progress. Call it the cosmopolitan consensus.
Even if you don’t speak white nationalist dog whistle, this speech is pretty shocking. Hawley is claiming that the United States is run, and has been run, by a secret group of international “elites” who value terrible things—such as education, achievement, and progress. People who think women should be able to have a career rather than be forced to stay at home.
But it’s far, far worse if you understand what he’s really saying, and understand the purpose of this convention.
The National Conservatism Conference is new. The meeting held this week in Washington was its inaugural event. It’s described as a movement for a “new vision of conservatism” that focuses on social issues and family values. Which sounds a lot like the old vision of conservatism, except that this one featured Hawley, John Bolton, and Tucker Carlson as the initial speakers, and the discussion mostly involved the horrors of diversity and the unseen hand of globalist elites.
Whichever way you want to put it, the focus of the conference really was on redefining conservatism—redefining it as a very familiar form of nationalism. Trump hasn’t shied away from using the term nationalism; he’s broadcast his fondness for the word. And the National Conservatism Conference was all about that, the merger of conservatism and nationalism into … National Conservatism.
Behind this convention is the Edmund Burke Foundation. Oddly enough, considering what Hawley said in the speech, this foundation definitely has international ambitions, the sort not seen since, say, 1945. Because the purpose of the Edmund Burke Foundation is precisely to marry conservative talking points with nationalism, and to spread that idea around the world, or at least to “Western and democratic” countries, as the group’s very small website makes clear.
At this conference, speakers didn’t come out just against “illegal immigration,” but against immigration in general. Or at least, immigration from the wrong kind of countries. And they spoke out against immigrants. One of them was a University of Pennsylvania law professor who called immigrants “too loud” and blamed them for “an increase in litter.”
That professor, Amy Wax, didn’t bother with any code words. She didn’t feel constrained by any moral qualms. She simply stated that “our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites.”
That’s at a conference keynoted by the newest Republican senator, and attended by members of Trump’s cabinet and pundits from Fox News. And somehow no one, no one seems to be screaming about it. It’s not in the headlines. It’s not causing pundits to drag out their fainting couches.
Now, if you didn’t get it the first time, go back and read Hawley’s speech again, the speech that was chosen to kick off the National Conservatism movement. And understand that every time Hawley says “cosmopolitan,” what he really means is “international Jews.” The use of that term has a long history in anti-Semitism. It’s exactly the term that was used, and the way that it was used, in the Soviet Union to justify the harassment, imprisonment, and murder of Russian Jews: “rootless cosmopolitans” who, according to Stalin, weren’t loyal to their own country, but to “all things foreign.”
It’s not clear how National Conservatism is meant to be abbreviated. Are its members Natcons, or Natcos, or just NatCs? Either way, there’s no doubt about how to pronounce it.","['white', 'nationalist', 'dog', 'whistle', 'elites', 'terrible']"

The Americans were waiting for him.
Armed with a tip from informants at the airport in the Syrian capital of Damascus, the CIA knew exactly when a jet carrying Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani took off en route to Baghdad. Intelligence from Israel helped confirm the details.
Once the Cham Wings Airlines Airbus A320 landed, American spies at Iraq’s main airport, which houses U.S. military personnel, confirmed its exact whereabouts.
Three American drones moved into position overhead, with no fear of challenge in an Iraqi airspace completely dominated by the U.S. military. Each was armed with four Hellfire missiles.
This account of how the United States took out Soleimani is based on interviews with two people directly familiar with the details of the operation, as well as other American officials who were briefed on it.
On large screens, various U.S. officials watched as an Iraqi militia leader walked up a set of stairs to greet the leader of Iran’s Quds Force as he emerged from the airplane.
It was past 1 in the morning, so the black and white infrared imagery wasn’t very clear. No faces could be seen.
The men on the ground had no idea that their lives were now to be measured in minutes.
CIA Director Gina Haspel was observing from agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was watching from another location. Another feed was on view in the White House, but President Donald Trump was in Florida at the time.
The imagery showed two senior figures get into a sedan, which pulled away. The rest of the entourage climbed into a minivan, which sped to catch up.
The drones followed as the vehicles began moving to exit the airport. Signals intelligence specialists sought to hone in on the cellphones of the occupants to confirm their identities. Years of mapping and terrain information from satellites was available on the screens of the drone operators.
Other vehicles passed occasionally, but traffic was light. The minivan pulled ahead of the sedan.

At U.S. Central Command forward headquarters in Qatar, from where the operation was being run, there were no significant doubts about who was inside those vehicles.
Those watching could see the missiles strike, a manmade bolt from the sky. The vehicles were engulfed in a fireball. In total, four missiles were fired. There were no survivors.
Soleimani, who had helped kill Americans for more than a decade, was no more.
U.S. military officials watched a live feed of the strikes at various locations around the world. Despite the successful operation, the reaction was somber as the gravity of the attack set in and the officials contemplated what response it could unleash.
It was an operation utterly unremarkable for any technical or intelligence wizardry. It’s remarkable, rather, for how routine such lethal actions have become.
The targeted killing is the latest demonstration of how, two decades after the CIA spotted but was unable to kill a man they believed was al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, the U.S. has become adept at hunting and killing its enemies, particularly in the troubled regions of the Middle East, South Asia and Africa.
“In less than a generation, we went from something that was abnormal and maybe even science fiction, to the point where it’s the new normal,” Peter Singer, an expert on future warfare at the New America Foundation, said. “Both leaders and the public don’t even blink an eye.”
Targeted strikes like the one that killed Soleimani represent a fundamental change in warfare, said Anthony Cordesman, who studies military trends at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
“It requires a truly immense intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance effort — one which basically no other country in the world can match, and which is vastly expensive, time-consuming and requires lot of expertise.”
The only thing different about Soleimani was that he was a state actor, a senior official of another government. For that reason, and in light of the expected retaliation from Iran, this strike has proven far more controversial than others. But as a technical matter, experts say, it was fairly straightforward.
Soleimani, long a shadowy presence in the Middle East, had ventured into public view in recent years, posing for pictures in Iraq and elsewhere as he plotted strategy to counter U.S. interests. So he wasn’t nearly as hard to find as bin Laden, who was hiding in Pakistan when he was killed in 2011, or the Islamic State militant group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in Syria during a U.S. raid in October after a yearslong manhunt.
Still, it’s not as if the Iranian put his name on passenger manifests. Tracking his travels took some doing, and knowing exactly where he would be was an intelligence feat, officials say. So was killing him in a way that risked no civilian casualties.
“These things are tricky,” one former special operator familiar with what happened said. “There is a lot that can go wrong.”
At the Baghdad airport, Soleimani was greeted by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of an Iraqi anti-American militia and a suspect in the bombing of the American and French embassies in Kuwait in 1983. Al-Muhandis got into the sedan with Soleimani and he, too, was killed in the strike.
The drones that followed the convoy are not silent, but in an urban environment like Baghdad, the sound they make is not easily discernible, officials say. There was no hint that the men in the vehicles knew they were being targeted.
The Iraqi government was not pleased by the news that the U.S. killed an official of a neighboring state on its territory without consultation. Two Iraqi security officials told Reuters that they are investigating the role of suspected U.S. informants at the Baghdad airport.
Syrian intelligence is investigating two employees of Cham Wings Airlines, Reuters reported.
U.S. officials told NBC News that they had been closely tracking Soleimani’s movements across the region for days. The Trump administration says he was planning attacks against Americans, though they have not released any evidence.
“We had specific information on an imminent threat,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a Friday news conference at the White House. “And those threats included attacks on U.S. embassies. Period, full stop.”
Iranian officials have said that Wednesday’s missile strikes against U.S. troops in Iraq, which caused no casualties, will be the end of their retaliation for the killing of their general. But U.S. intelligence officials don’t believe that.

If you’re a real political animal, you might remember Margaret Spellings who served in George W. Bush’s first term or know the present occupant, Joe Rogan, who is leaving the position on May 24.
Along with the Economic Policy Council, the DPC is part of the Office of White House Policy. It’s distinct from the Office of Legislative Affairs, which is responsible for advancing a president’s agenda in Congress. The DPC is more of a big-picture organization and it often operates much like a standard cabinet meeting. The leader of the group has a lot of sway over the White House, although how much depends on the president. Bruce Reed, for example, was a founding member of the Democratic Leadership Council and one of the primary authors of Clinton’s controversial welfare reform as well as the administration’s numerous statutory and administrative crackdowns on the gun industry. Melody Barnes was a civil rights attorney and counsel to Senator Ted Kennedy on the Judiciary Committee. She helped push through the Affordable Care Act.
As POLITICO reports, there has just been a major fight among Republican activists and White House staff over who will replace the outgoing Joe Rogan. Initially, it was decided that White House staff secretary Derek Lyons would get the position. Members of the administration began talking about the choice on background with reporters. But then there was a revolt from conservatives who objected to Mr. Lyons because of his connections to Jeb Bush. In particular, the MAGA crowd is hostile to Jeb’s pro-immigrant rhetoric during the 2016 campaign.
His affiliation with [Jared] Kushner also raised some eyebrows, given that Trump’s son-in-law has pushed for some more moderate policies, including business-friendly immigration changes that hardliners say are too lenient. “This is not what #AmericaFirst voters signed up for,” tweeted conservative commentator Michelle Malkin May 6 using the hashtag #JaredKushnerIsNotMyPresident. Malkin described Lyons as someone who comes from Jeb Bush’s “Illegal Immigration Is An Act of Love” wing of the GOP. “Trump has picked Derek Lyons as the head of the Domestic Policy Council…- he’s a former Jeb! Person,” tweeted Ryan Girdusky, a conservative writer and political consultant.
This gave Trump hardliners in the White House the juice they needed to overturn the decision. Instead of Derek Lyons, it will be Brooke Rollins filling the position. She’s the former president of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, “a think tank based in Austin partly funded by the Koch Brothers.” There are a couple of ironies here. First, she’s also affiliated with Jared Kushner, as she presently heads his Office of American Innovation. Second, the Koch Brothers are not exactly well-aligned with Trump, and nowhere are they in less agreement than on immigration policy.
But, whether this switch constitutes a true win for the racist right or not, it’s clear that MAGA conservatives are highly attuned to how decisions are made in the White House and which positions they want to control.
Contrast this with the progressive left. When it was recently announced that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be co-chairing a climate panel for Joe Biden’s policy shop with John Kerry, there was an uproar on social media. How could she sell-out her principles and work with establishment Democrats?
Ocasio-Cortez, Kerry and Biden might not seem like a natural fit, but the group came together because they all recognize that they need each other. When AOC, perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most high-profile congressional endorser, moved to embrace Biden as the inevitable nominee, she earned some good will. John Kerry praised and defended her during his April climate testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee for offering “more leadership in one day or one week than President Trump has in his lifetime.”
You might think that supporters of Bernie Sanders would be gratified to see Ocasio-Cortez placed in a position to help craft Biden’s climate policies, but the loudest voices were all extremely cynical about the move and critical of AOC for accepting it.
Ironically, back in March, Ocasio-Cortez was on television defending the Green New Deal and said, “This is not a Tea Party of the left, this is a return to representative democracy.” But many of her erstwhile supporters abandoned her when she gained a seat at the table. She might not act like the Tea Party, but many wish she would.
The progressive left too often does not want power. Power is pretty much all the racist right wants. Both groups are known for making unrealistic demands, but the Tea Party strategists actually understand the leverage points and will fight to get their people into positions of influence. At least in that limited respect, the Tea Party is a more effective anti-establishment organization.","['racist', 'MAGA']"
"Rep. Gaetz, known for spreading fake news, conspiracy theories and lies, and supporting the alt-right, announced to the House Judiciary Committee that undocumented immigrants are to blame for gun violence and building President Trump’s wall would reduce the violence.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/dem-rep-takes-down-trump-loving-goper-for-blaming-gun-violence-on-immigrants-are-members-of-congress-entitled-to-make-things-up/,alternet,gun-control,left,66.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island eloquently blasted Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida during Wednesday’s House hearing on gun control.
Rep. Gaetz, known for spreading fake news, conspiracy theories and lies, and supporting the alt-right, announced to the House Judiciary Committee that undocumented immigrants are to blame for gun violence and building President Trump’s wall would reduce the violence.
The far-right Florida Congressman cited no research and did not offer any proof of his claims. In fact, immigrants, especially undocumented immigrants, demonstrate lower rates of violence and crime than native-born Americans.
In response, Congressman Cicilline interrupted, asking for a “parliamentary inquiry” – a request to determine the rules – and asked: “Are members in Congress entitled to just make things up?”
Chairman Jerry Nadler said he did not believe there was a rule prohibiting false information, but Members are welcome to challenge them with facts.
Later, Rep. Gaetz directed his comments to Rep. Cicilline, saying Members are “not entitled to their own facts,” while again blaming “violent illegal aliens” for crimes, including murder.
Wednesday’s House hearing on gun violence was the first in 8 years. Republican did not address the issue despite the increase in mass shooting deaths.
At the very end of the video and Rep. Gaetz’s diatribe, someone can be heard saying, “Oh, Jesus Christ” in the audio.

"Now Modi has made international headlines for yet another similarity: He’s constructing a massive wall … but unlike Trump’s goal of keeping immigrants out, Modi’s wall was built to hide the country’s poverty from the gold-plated American president.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/india-builds-a-wall-to-hide-its-poor-people-days-before-trumps-visit/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,66.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often compared to Donald Trump, especially when it comes to his anti-Muslim policies. Now Modi has made international headlines for yet another similarity: He’s constructing a massive wall … but unlike Trump’s goal of keeping immigrants out, Modi’s wall was built to hide the country’s poverty from the gold-plated American president. Government officials in one of India’s largest states have built a barrier that’s over 1,000 feet wide and four feet high ahead of Trump’s visit to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, on Feb. 24. Thousands of his Indian supporters are estimated to be in attendance at the “Namaste Trump” event. The Trump visit is expected to cost the city over 800 million Indian rupees, or roughly $11 million USD.
“Since they are spending so much money on this wall, why not use that to improve our slum and provide better facilities for us,” Gujarat resident Keshi Saraniya told the Associated Press. “Why are they hiding us poor people?” While government officials claim the wall was built “for security reasons” and to beautify the area, critics argue the wall was constructed to conceal slums located near the venue hosting Trump’s event. Trump will be visiting the Motera Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, and in order to get there he must pass a slum area that is inhabited by over 2,000 people.
Several political leaders and activists have questioned the timing of the Ahmedabad wall and other development work Modi has been doing in the state (prior to becoming prime minister, Modi was chief minister of Gujarat for 12 years). The wall has faced widespread media attention and criticism for being built days before Trump’s upcoming event, and for leaving thousands homeless. “The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) government doesn’t want the world to see that poverty exists in Gujarat. They want Trump and others to see only the big buildings, roads and that everyone here has toilets and homes,” Mina Jadhav, general secretary of Majdur Adhikar Manch, a trade union in Gujarat, told Al Jazeera. “They (the BJP) want to hide the poor people living in slums, that is why it has sent the eviction notices to these families and built a wall to shield Trump from noticing another slum.”
BJP is a Hindu nationalist party that was formed to make India a “Hindu Rashtra,” or Hindu nation. The party is known to use violence and any other means to advance its agenda of ridding the country of anyone who does not follow what they claim is Hindu ideology or values.
At least 45 families living in slums near the stadium were issued eviction notices Monday. Residents said they were evicted because of the event, but Ahmedabad city officials have denied the allegations, insisting that the land belongs to the city and the evictions were carried out lawfully, the AP reported. “We have been living here for the last 20 years and now we are suddenly being told to vacate because some important leader is visiting this city for a day,” Sanjay Patani said. “This is injustice.”
Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra defended the wall on Twitter, claiming the decision was made prior to Trump’s plan to visit to “prevent encroachments on footpath and road” and that he had “personally visited the slum” to offer affordable housing to the residents. Residents told Al Jazeera that they are unsure what to do. “(T)he government is saying it is helping poor people in constructing new homes but here we are being evicted from a piece of land,” explained Tejabhai Meda, a laborer who lived in the area for over 22 years. “We are not asking the government for homes, we are saying ‘give us a piece of land where we can live.’”
The “Namaste Trump” event follows a controversial but well-attended “Howdy Modi” event held in Houston last September. Over 50,000 Indian Americans were said to have attended the event to welcome Modi to the U.S. The event, promoted by Trump, aimed to marshal Indian American support for his 2020 presidential campaign. “Namaste Trump” furthers this goal by showing Indian Americans that Trump cares about the relationship their home country has with the U.S. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group in the states and an influential voter base. The majority identify as Gujarati, or someone from the Indian state of Gujarat, the same as Modi.
Modi follows in Trump’s footsteps when it comes to disregarding residents while building a wall for unethical reasons. Last month, a portion of Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall fell over, with Mexican authorities quickly responding in order to avoid civilian casualties. In addition, both of the authoritarian administrations continue to pass anti-immigrant policies increasingly against Muslims, including Trump’s travel ban and Modi’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which targets asylum-seeking Muslims and restricts them from gaining citizenship.
The wall is just the latest part of Modi’s larger agenda of targeting poor and minority communities, allegedly in order to improve India’s image abroad. Similar to Trump’s 2016 campaign, Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party promoted itself on the premise of strong economic growth to the masses; however, people around the country are suffering both economically and systematically due to oppressive barriers. As a result of fear and insecurity coupled with poorly implemented policies over the past few years, the country’s growth has significantly slowed down over time. Right now India has the worst economy it’s experienced in 42 years.
Trump boasted last week that Modi promised “millions and millions” of people would honor him on his route to the stadium, Al Jazeera reported. Trump will likely enjoy the devotion he’ll encounter during his trip to India. Unlike his visits to England and states in his home country, the American president is unlikely to encounter discord or protesters in the state of Gujarat because of the state’s devotion to Modi. Those affected by the violence of BJP and opposed to Modi will be far from Trump’s vision, hidden behind a wall. As university protests against CAA and BJP sweep across the nation, Indian youth are the only hope India has to combat a right-wing leader like Modi and anyone else who puts the lives of minorities at risk.",['gold-plated']

"I'm also struck by Blackburn's style of needlessly toxic politics, once again questioning the patriotism of a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran who earned a Purple Heart.",https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-republicans-are-taking-aim-war-hero-defend-trump-n1123626,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,66.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Fox News' Tucker Carlson and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) went after Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman on the air last night, with the conservative host questioning his loyalties and the Republican congressman pushing for his ouster from the White House, where Vindman is the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council.
As the Washington Post noted, they weren't alone.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who along with every other senator serves as a juror in the impeachment trial, took to Twitter and impugned the patriotism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Blackburn referred to an allegation that Vindman had badmouthed the United States in a conversation with Russians while serving overseas. ""Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot,"" Blackburn said. ""How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy?""
First, there's very little evidence that Vindman ever badmouthed the United States, and there are plenty of reasons to believe the accusation is made-up. Second, if the far-right Tennessee senator is concerned about officials who have badmouthed the United States in reality, I'd love to introduce Marsha Blackburn to Donald Trump -- who's criticized our country in ways few American leaders ever have.

I'm also struck by Blackburn's style of needlessly toxic politics, once again questioning the patriotism of a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran who earned a Purple Heart. If she doesn't want to thank him for his honorable service, that's her business, but these ugly attempts at smearing him are unbecoming of those in positions of authority.
But as offensive as these GOP antics were, let's not lose sight of why, exactly, some Republicans seem so eager to tarnish the reputation of an American war hero who's done nothing wrong.
Those who watched yesterday's proceedings in Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial know that House Democratic managers made extensive use of Vindman's knowledge and experiences in the White House -- and for good reason.
Vindman was on the call during Trump's July 25 phone meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky; the National Security Council expert quickly realized that the American president had gone too far and undermined U.S. national security interests; and he reported his concerns to his superiors.
In other words, a White House official had first-hand knowledge of Trump abusing his power, corroborating other witnesses' testimony.
And for the president's acolytes, that makes Vindman politically inconvenient. If that means some Republicans have to try to smear a decorated American veteran, it's a price they're willing to pay in service of Trump.

"...immigrants as criminals and eugenics, all of which were once considered fringe and extreme. White nationalists embrace white supremacist and white separatist views.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/after-stephen-miller-s-white-nationalist-views-outed-latinos-ask-n1096071,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,66.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
It wasn't the content of White House adviser Stephen Miller’s leaked emails that shocked Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from El Paso, Texas, but the silence of her Republican colleagues that has followed.
Miller is the architect of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies that have separated children from parents, forced people seeking asylum in the U.S. to wait in Mexico under squalid conditions, instituted the Muslim ban and poured money from the military into border wall construction. The administration is currently under fire for the deaths of migrant children and teens who have died while in government custody.
In a trove of emails provided to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, Miller cited and promoted white nationalist ideologies of white genocide, immigrants as criminals and eugenics, all of which were once considered fringe and extreme. White nationalists embrace white supremacist and white separatist views.
Three weeks after the emails were made public, Miller still is in the White House. Only Democrats have called on the White House to rid itself of white nationalism.
“It really has been jarring (that) the president’s enablers and Republicans have not stood up and said, Mr. President, this is unacceptable,” Escobar said in an interview. “I would implore my Republican colleagues to join us in calling for Stephen Miller’s resignation,” she said.
MIller's ideology has wide reach, consequences
Escobar represents El Paso, where a gunman opened fire in a Walmart on Aug. 3, killing 22 people and injuring 26.
Police have said the suspect in the El Paso shootings told them his target was “Mexicans.” They also said he posted an anti-immigrant, anti-Latino screed that stated the attack was a “response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."" Some of the language in the screed is considered similar to words used by the president and state leaders.
After the shootings, Trump condemned white supremacy and said “hate has no place in America"" but did not mention that Latinos were targeted or that the victims were predominantly Latino in his speech.
Miller is more than helping reshape immigration policy.
With Miller's assistance, the administration is ""doing an end run around Congress to dismantle every aspect of the immigration system"" through executive actions and gutting regulations and replacing them with their own, said Doug Rand, an immigration policy adviser in the Obama White House and cofounder of Boundless Immigration, which uses technology to help immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.

""Believe it or not, it's possible to be to the right of President Trump on immigration, and that's where Stephen Miller has spent his whole career,"" Rand said. ""He idealizes the 1924 law that banned immigrants from just about everywhere but Western Europe, and he is pulling every lever he can find throughout the federal government to accomplish the same outcome.""
Escobar has asked the Department of Homeland Security to audit its policies to determine which were influenced by Miller ""to show the motivations of the administration's immigration policies and shed light on the people that help craft them.""
Separately, 107 members of Congress signed a letter to Trump demanding he fire Miler.

""A documented white nationalist has no place in any administration, and especially not in such an influential position,"" the Democratic congressional members said in the letter.
There also are several petitions calling for Miller’s resignation, including one started by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that had more than 130,000 signatures as of this week.
Miller previously worked for former Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. — who served as Trump’s first attorney general — before joining the Trump campaign.
More tolerance for intolerance?
That he persists reflects a change in what the country and political leaders are willing to tolerate under a Trump administration.
At the start of the year, House Republicans removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, from committee assignments after he said in an interview with The New York Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”
When he said in 2013 that young immigrants had calves the size of cantaloupes, King drew condemnation from throughout the party, including from Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and former Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Florida Republicans. King has been repeatedly re-elected and is a Trump ally.
Diaz-Balart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the three most senior Latino Republicans in Congress, either didn’t respond or declined to comment on the calls for Miller’s resignation.
Rubio and Diaz-Balart, both from immigrant families, have a moderate record on immigration. Miller even targeted Rubio in emails to get negative stories written about him by Breitbart. Rubio's response has been that he knew Miller wasn't a fan of his immigration policies.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment. The White House has defended Miller in previous statements to media, raising Miller’s Jewish background in that defense.
Ocasio-Cortez dismissed that defense in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes saying ""the color of your skin and the identity you are born with does not absolve you of moral wrong.""
""I don't think any public servant should weaponize their identity in order to advance white nationalist ideas. Period. Punto. I don't care who you are,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. Having Miller at the helm of U.S. immigration policy means policies “will become more fascistic and we cannot allow that to be us,"" she said.
A rise in violent, white supremacist extremism
In his emails, Miller makes clear the esteem he holds for another period in the country, when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Immigration Act of 1924 that severely restricted immigration from certain parts of the world. Coolidge is admired by white nationalists, according to the SPLC.
The act was the nation's first comprehensive restrictive immigration policy that established the Border Patrol.
After being told that Fox radio host Mark Levin has said there should be no immigration for several years ""for assimilation purposes,"" Miller responds:
""Like Coolidge did. Kellyanne Conway poll says that is exactly what most Americans want after 40 years of non-stop record arrivals,"" according to emails posted by SPLC. Conway is an adviser to Trump.
In referencing the 1924 act, Miller is ""harkening to an era of racial violence,"" said Monica Muñoz Martinez, author of ""The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas.""
FBI statistics released in November showed an increase in hate crimes and violence against Latinos.
In a September report, the Department of Homeland Security said while the country still faces threats from foreign terrorist organizations, “unfortunately, the severity and number of domestic threats have also grown.”
The agency said there has been a “concerning” rise in attacks by people motivated by racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism, including white supremacist violent extremism, anti-government and anti-authority violent extremism and other ideologies.
White supremacist violent extremists can generally be characterized by hatred for immigrants and ethnic minorities, often combining these prejudices with virulent anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim views, the DHS report states.
In a Sept. 6, 2015, email, Miller suggested Breitbart write about “The Camp of the Saints,” SPLC reported. The novel's theme is the end of white civilization by migrants who arrive from India.
Kathleen Belew, an expert on the white-power movement, said in an interview with NPR that Miller’s citation of the book is “clear evidence that this is a person who is immersed in trafficking in white nationalist ideology.”
“Voters across the country, constituents across the country who see their leaders standing in silence in the face of unprecedented racism and bigotry at the highest levels of government in our generation, they need to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves: Is this acceptable?” Escobar said.

“In 20 years of writing about the military, I have never heard officers in high positions express such alarm about a president,” the article noted.
This, of course, was before the president ignored his national security team, withdrew U.S. forces from northern Syria, and effectively invited Turkey to launch a brutal offensive against our Kurdish allies. As the Washington Post reported yesterday, Trump’s decision isn’t sitting well with many U.S. service members.
U.S. veterans have supported Trump in part because of his often-repeated promises to extricate the U.S. military from a generation at war, numerous polls have found. But the calamity on the ground in Syria has wrought angry reactions from service members like few other recent foreign policy decisions. Troops have reacted viscerally in interviews and on social media despite Defense Department restrictions on them expressing political opinions.
The Post spoke with many troops who “expressed disgust” with the president’s decision.
“I can’t even look at the atrocities,” one Army officer who served in Syria last year said. “The ISIS mission is going to stop, ISIS is going to have a resurgence, and we’re going to have to go back in five years and do it all again.”
A day earlier, David Ignatius wrote in his latest column about a conversation he’d had with a retired four-star general who described Trump’s retreat from Syria as an “unsound, morally indefensible act” and a “disgrace” to America and the soldiers who serve this country.
Ignatius also spoke to an Army officer who added, in reference to Trump’s decision, “It will go down in infamy…. This will go down as a stain on the American reputation for decades.”
The president seems to assume that he enjoys broad political support within the military, which he perceives as conservative, and there’s probably some truth to that. The Military Times reported a few months ago on a poll of U.S. military veterans and the results showed Trump with a 57% approval rating, while 41% disapprove. This is roughly the inverse of Trump’s support with the overall U.S. population.
But if the president believes those numbers can never and will never change, he may be disappointed.","['ignored', 'effectively', 'brutal']"
"For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of  fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,67.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump’s racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are “originally” from somewhere else and should therefore “go back” — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.
Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it’s a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.
As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump “believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.”
There’s good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, “Trump’s popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,” and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.
So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.
For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Such “birther” theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be “real” Americans.
Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.
Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. “Replacement theory” — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and “replaced” by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that’s become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are “invading the country” and can never be “fully American,” and that demographic changes from immigration are “more change than human beings are designed to digest” and inherently a threat to “your neighborhood.”
The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be “tipping over a cliff.”
This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['neo-Nazis', 'white', 'people', 'fringe']"

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — President Donald Trump accused Democrats of “politicizing” the deadly coronavirus during a campaign rally here on Friday, claiming that the outbreak is “their new hoax” as he continued to downplay the risk in the U.S.
“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” Trump said. “They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.”
“This is their new hoax,” Trump continued, adding that attacking the White House’s response to the coronavirus had become the Democratic Party’s “single talking point.”
Trump has weaponized the word “hoax” throughout his presidency, using it to belittle and discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference as well as his impeachment trial. He also has a long history of distrusting experts, most notably his own intelligence community and government scientists.
“Democrats will always say horrible things,"" Trump said. ""Democrats want us to fail so badly.”
Trump — who has been criticized for painting an overly rosy picture of the outbreak, often contradicting his own health officials — insisted on Friday that his administration was “magnificently organized” and “totally prepared"" to address the virus.

""My administration has taken the most aggressive acts in history to prevent the spread in the United States,"" Trump said, touting his decision to ban foreign nationals recently in China from entering the U.S.
Trump again drew a misleading comparison between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu, telling his supporters that ""35,000 on average each year die from the flu, that's a lot of people.""
“So far we have lost nobody to coronavirus,"" Trump said, suggesting the growing global panic was due to the press being in a ""hysteria mode.""
Experts say that the coronavirus is significantly more contagious than the flu and a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away.
Trump faced bipartisan pressure after he requested $2.5 billion in coronavirus response funding, which lawmakers from both parties said wasn't enough. He later said that if Congress wants to grant additional funds, ""I'll take it.""
More than 83,000 people have been sickened by the coronavirus and at least 2,857 have died since the start of January when the virus was first discovered in China. As the virus spread rapidly across Europe and the Middle East this past week, Wall Street suffered its worst week since the financial crisis.

Trump, who ran on a promise to build a southern border wall, used the outbreak as another opportunity to attack Democrats' position on immigration and border security.
“We must understand that border security is also health security,” Trump added, as rallygoers chanted “build the wall.” “The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”

By the time House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke to reporters yesterday afternoon, the White House had already confirmed Donald Trump’s plan: the president would sign the bipartisan spending bill, thereby preventing another shutdown, and then issue an emergency declaration to build a wall.
The California Democrat quickly turned her attention to one of Republican lawmakers’ top concerns: what future presidents might do with the same power Trump is claiming today.
“I know the Republicans have some unease about it no matter what they say, because if the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency, an illusion that he wants to convey, just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people. “You want to talk about a national emergency? Let’s talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would. “But a Democratic president can do that. Democratic president can declare emergencies as well. So, the precedent that the president is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans.”
Of course, Pelosi wasn’t just speaking hypothetically. There are already some Republicans feeling “great unease” over this.
As we discussed a month ago, Erick Erickson, a prominent voice in conservative media, wrote on Twitter, “When the next Democratic president declares a national emergency over gun violence and takes executive actions to curtail gun purchases, you can thank the people urging Donald Trump to do the same with regards to the border.”
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) raised the same concern on CNBC, though he pointed to a different issue.
The Florida Republican contended that Trump was elected on the promise of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and the president has to “keep that promise.” But “we have to be careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power,” he added. “I’m not prepared to endorse that right now.” Such a declaration would set a precedent, Rubio said. “If today, the national emergency is border security … tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.”
There are some statutory limits about emergency powers to consider, but broadly speaking, these conservatives are right to be concerned. Once the door is open, and presidents start pursuing their ambitions in defiance of Congress, it isn’t just Republicans who’ll walk through that opening.
In fact, Rubio’s example is of particular interest – since the climate crisis, unlike the need for a giant border wall, is real. In fact, as NBC News’ Benjy Sarlin explained, if a Democratic president were to try such a move, “compared to the wall, there would be tons of government studies and testimony from [national security] officials backing up a crisis frame.”
Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) appeared on CNN in January and was asked how he’d react if a Democratic president followed in Trump’s footsteps, tried to declare a “national emergency” on climate change, and began taking actions outside of congressional approval. The far-right Alabaman didn’t seem eager to talk about it.
Before they decide whether to let this stand, congressional Republicans should probably have an uncomfortable conversation.
Postscript: Just for the record, there’s no reason to limit our focus to the next president. Trump is granting himself new powers to redirect funds in defiance of Congress’ wishes, but how sure are we that he won’t do something similar before leaving office?
I can’t say whether Trump will win a second term or whether one of his many scandals will bring his presidency to a premature end. But I can say Trump will almost certainly remain in office for a while longer, and if he can get away with circumventing the rule of law on this issue, it’s very easy to believe he may pursue other priorities the same way.",['uncomfortable']
"Radical Virginia Citizens Defense League has organized a rally in Richmond for January 20, and the event is already attracting out-of-state pro-gun folks, including a potential horde of white nationalists.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/pro-gun-protesters-actively-yearning-for-a-civil-war-set-their-sights-on-virginia/,alternet,gun-control,left,67.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Lois Beckett has an article in The Guardian on the growing backlash against the prospect of Virginia’s state legislature passing gun violence legislation this year. Apparently, opponents of gun control are surprising people, including their own organizational leaders, with the size and breadth of their activism.
The forcefulness of Virginia’s second-amendment movement has taken even longtime organizers by surprise. Government meetings across the state that typically attract a few dozen people have seen overflowing crowds of hundreds or even thousands showing up to protest against new gun laws… … Still, at least 125 counties, cities and towns across Virginia have passed some version of a second amendment sanctuary resolution since November, according to the Virginia Citizens Defense League. Just this week, the city council in Virginia Beach, the site of a major mass shooting last May, became one of the latest local governments to pass a resolution pledging to support citizens’ gun rights. “I’ve never seen anything like this in the second amendment movement,” echoed Cam Edwards, a Virginia resident and former NRA TV host, and the editor of Bearing Arms, a pro-gun website. The closest political analogy would be the Tea Party, he said, “but this movement is centered around a single issue.”
These sanctuary resolutions are pledges by local governments that they won’t enforce state law. The movement is reportedly being led less by the NRA than by the more radical Virginia Citizens Defense League and its president Philip Van Cleave:
Van Cleave sounded almost breathless in a mid-December interview as he described being overwhelmed with emails, phone calls, and membership requests. He said he expected VCDL’s membership to double over the course of that month, from 8000 to 16,000 members. “I’m telling you, people that have never committed a crime, that are law-abiding, and pay their taxes, do everything right, don’t even have a speeding ticket, are saying, ‘I’m not giving up my guns,’” Van Cleave said.
The group has organized a rally in Richmond for January 20, which is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The event is already attracting out-of-state pro-gun folks, including a potential horde of white nationalists.
White supremacist and anti-government groups are gravitating towards the standoff over gun rights in Virginia because they see it as a opportunity for radicalization and recruitment, said Daryl Johnson, a former lead analyst for domestic terrorism at the Department of Homeland Security.
They’re being mobilized by the usual suspects:
Virginia’s gun rights battle is already being covered widely in conservative media outlets. Donald Trump and the rightwing Arizona congressman Paul Gosar shared articles about it on Twitter. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson talked to a guest on his show about fears that local law enforcement in Virginia would be sent in to confiscate citizens’ guns. Carlson blamed the left for “trying to pick a fight, like a real fight, with rural Virginia”.
The movement is already steeped in bad information and conspiracy theories, and they’ve locked on Michael Bloomberg and his Judaism as a rallying cry.
White supremacist “accelerationists” have seized on the standoff as the potential beginning of a civil war that will destroy the United States and allow them to build a white nation in its ruins, according to Alex Friedfeld, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League. “The story they’re telling is that the Jews and immigrants are responsible for turning Virginia blue, and they’re coming to take your guns,” Friedfeld said. (Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire philanthropist and presidential candidate, is Jewish, and the gun violence prevention advocacy group he founded touted an investment of $2.5 million in Virginia’s 2019 elections to back local lawmakers who support gun control.) To white supremacists, Virginia looks like a perfect example of their ideology: “You’ve got white replacement. You’ve got what they’re calling Jewish gun grabbers, and the people rising up, saying the government is illegitimate.”
The prospect of a possible repeat of the violence we saw in 2017 in Charlottesville has local and state officials concerned.
So far, Ralph Northam, the state’s Democratic governor, has said that plans to pass new gun violence prevention laws will move forward despite the public backlash. “Everyone needs to work to turn the rhetoric down – at the end of the day, this is about keeping people safe,” Alena Yarmosky, a spokesperson for the governor, said.
The January 20 rally in the capital will be a challenge for law enforcement, especially because many of the protestors are actively yearning for a civil war that will destroy the country and allow them to set up a new nation based on white supremacy and anti-Semitism.
Apparently, even many people within the gun rights movement are concerned and are working to prevent people from openly bringing weapons to the rally. But with leaders like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump rooting them on, the “good people” who will descend on Richmond on January 20 may feel like they have approval to light a spark.","['horde', 'Radical', 'pro-gun', 'white', 'nationalists']"

And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['narcissistic', 'moron', 'demands', 'mulligans']"
"The whole endeavor, born of desperation, became an embarrassing fiasco for the president, but there was an underlying point of real significance: Trump and his allies realized that the American mainstream didn’t see the value of the regressive GOP tax plan, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/team-trump-claims-be-gearing-tax-cuts-20,msnbc,middle-class,left,67.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, Donald Trump announced that he and congressional Republicans were working “around the clock” on a new, “very major” tax cut, which would exclusively benefit the middle class, and which would be ready no later than Nov. 1. Even by his standards, the president’s claim was bizarre: lawmakers weren’t on Capitol Hill; there was no work being done on the issue; and even White House officials were “mystified” by Trump’s absurd rhetoric.
The whole endeavor, born of desperation, became an embarrassing fiasco for the president, but there was an underlying point of real significance: Trump and his allies realized that the American mainstream didn’t see the value of the regressive GOP tax plan, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations.
Republican leaders were ready for a second tax cut, in large part because the first one didn’t produce the intended results.
While Trump’s pre-election scheme was quickly exposed as a joke, his goal of another round of tax breaks was real. A few weeks ago, he again said he’s determined to “approve a major middle income Tax Cut” – possibly in 2021.
As Politico reported, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is eyeing tax cuts even earlier than that.
“I think there’s no question the U.S. economy is in very good shape. As we look around the world, there’s no question that China is slowing, Europe is slowing – the U.S. is the bright spot of the world,” Mnuchin told reporters. “And regards to a middle-class tax cut, you know, we’ll be looking at tax cuts 2.0, something that will be something we’ll consider next year,” he continued. “But right now, the economy is in very, very good shape.”
For now, let’s put aside the fact that every time top administration officials scramble to tell everyone how great the economy is, they sound a little less convincing. Let’s instead turn to the vague idea Mnuchin and his boss are excited about.
First, Team Trump’s credibility on the subject leaves much to be desired. The president and his Republican brethren made all kinds of predictions about what would happen if their tax plan passed, and each of those predictions – from job creation to growth rates to the fiscal impact – turned out to be wrong.
With a track record like that, it’s tough to take the same folks seriously when they say more of their failed idea will work wonders.
Second, I’m curious how, exactly, Team Trump intends to pursue “tax cuts 2.0.” The last time I checked, there’s a progressive House Democratic majority that probably won’t be too eager to go along with another dubious White House tax scheme. The president could try to unilaterally push a tax break by indexing the capital gains tax to inflation, but that would benefit the very wealthy – just like the “tax cuts 1.0.”
It’s a misguided plan, being pursued in a misguided way.","['embarrassing', 'fiasco', 'desperation', 'disproportionately']"
"We could turn our attention to the fact that Republicans spent much of the last decade falsely accusing Democrats of supporting Medicare cuts through the Affordable Care Act, only to have a GOP White House actually propose taking an ax to the social-insurance program.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/medicare-trump-arrives-his-read-my-lips-moment,msnbc,middle-class,left,68.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"In 1988, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush was seen by some in his party as too moderate, and he sought to assuage those concerns by vowing not to raise taxes. It became a central pillar of Bush’s national campaign, and was a key element to his success as a national candidate: “Read my lips,” he said. “No new taxes.”
As we’ve discussed before, it was a promise Bush decided not to keep. The Republican, needing to cut a budget deal with a Democratic Congress, eventually agreed to some tax increases, reluctantly abandoning his pledge as part of a 1990 package. Two years later, he lost his re-election bid.
Three decades later, another Republican is in the White House, and with the unveiling of his new budget, another Republican president has arrived at a “read-my-lips” moment of his own.
There’s a lot to chew on in Donald Trump’s new budget blueprint, but the Washington Post highlighted one of the key takeaways.
Trump’s “Budget for a Better America” also includes dozens of spending cuts and policy overhauls that frame the early stages of the debate for the 2020 election. For example, Trump for the first time calls for cutting $845 billion from Medicare, the popular health care program for the elderly that in the past he had largely said he would protect. His budget would also propose a major overhaul of Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans run jointly with states, by turning more power over to states. This would save $241 billion over 10 years.
We could turn our attention to the fact that Republicans spent much of the last decade falsely accusing Democrats of supporting Medicare cuts through the Affordable Care Act, only to have a GOP White House actually propose taking an ax to the social-insurance program.
We could also point out how many of us said Trump and his party, unable to pay for their massive tax breaks for the wealthy, would invariably go after Medicare and Medicaid to help finance the tax giveaways – just as Republicans are doing now.
But as important as those details are, I’m especially interested in the scope of Trump’s betrayal.
It’s easy to forget, but when Trump launched his presidential candidacy nearly four years ago, he was very far to the right on issues such as race and immigration, but he went out of his way to appear moderate on many other issues, especially social-insurance programs often known as “entitlements.”
As Trump argued in 2015, “I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican’s going to cut, and even if they wouldn’t, they don’t know what to do because they don’t know where the money is. I do. I do.”
It was a staple of the Republican’s platform. In his campaign kick-off speech, Trump said he’d make no cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. He bragged about the vow via Twitter, over and over and over again.
This promise played a key role in the inexperienced television personality’s bid to win the GOP nomination and ultimately the presidency. And yet, here we are, watching Trump, unable to pay for his tax breaks, go back on his word.
It’s possible, if not likely, that Trump and his political operation will say this doesn’t count as a broken promise because Congress won’t actually approve the proposed Medicare cuts. It’ll be a tough sell: the White House budget plan is supposed to reflect the president’s vision for federal investments. It’s a blueprint for how Trump would like to govern if he controlled all of the levers of power.
In other words, a budget makes plain a president’s values – and in 2019, this president values deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, despite all of his assurances to the contrary.
Postscript: Don’t be surprised if House Democrats bring Trump’s budget to the floor for a vote, just to see how many of the president’s GOP allies are prepared to go on the record supporting his vision.
Update: Trump didn’t just “evolve” on Medicare over the course of three years. As recently as November 2018 – just four months ago – the president told voters, “Democrats want to raid Medicare to find socialism. It won’t last long. Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who have earned it.”","['ax', 'falsely', 'accusing']"
How the coronavirus pandemic shows that Christian white nationalism is a much greater threat to the US than radical Islam,https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-shows-that-christian-white-nationalism-is-a-much-greater-threat-to-the-us-than-radical-islam/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,68.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On March 15, Politico reported that according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the terrorist group ISIS — in its al Naba newsletter — was advising its members to avoid traveling to Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic and offered tips on social distancing and ways to avoid becoming infected (including frequent handwashing). ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['much', 'greater', 'radical']"
"Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them.

Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/bunker-boy-trump-thinks-he-can-edit-reality-like-tv-show/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,68.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Whatever the specifics of what Donald Trump’s diagnosis may be, from the moment protesters started to hit the streets to denounce police brutality, one thing was certain: The president’s brainworms would direct his energies away from doing anything useful and toward the task of managing his ego, relying on the reality TV tricks he mistakes for the real work of presidenting.
And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['wuss', 'wimpiness']"
"Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/how-secret-israeli-attacks-in-iraq-are-driving-trumps-anti-iran-campaign/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,68.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, notes former CIA analyst Paul Pillar, is more obsession than strategy, and a not-so-mysterious explosion on the outskirts of Baghdad Monday shows why.
Iraqi political analysts are blaming the attack on Israel, saying it follows two attacks earlier this month on facilities of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. According to an Israeli news report, Israel launched the two attacks with U.S.-made F-35 jets.
Israel has long attacked Iranian-backed forces in Syria, an enemy of the United States. Now Israel has expanded its scope of operations to attack targets in Iraq, whose coalition government is friendly to the United States. The predictable result: the Iraqi government is bailing on Trump’s policy.
The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region. When things go wrong, a strategy can be rethought. An obsession can only ignore the warning signs.
The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen that was supposed to check Iran’s power is now in disarray. The bloody war that Trump continued, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is farther than ever from success.
The U.S.-backed Yemen war is losing allies, even among the Persian Gulf states that fear Iran. First, the United Arab Emirates announced it is now bailing out of the Yemen war effort. Then, separatist Yemeni forces, backed by the UAE, took the southern port city of Aden from the Saudi-backed forces. Saudi Arabia is now fighting another war in Yemen that has nothing to do with Iran. It’s a maximum mess.
In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is whispering in the ear of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.) Last month Germany refused to join a U.S.-led naval mission to the Persian Gulf aimed at deterring Iranian attacks, saying everything should be done to avoid escalation sought by Washington.
When it comes to “maximum pressure,” the international reaction is: “include me out”—except in Israel, and therein lies the danger for the U.S. government and the American people. Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran.
Iran is growing stronger across the region and in Iraq in particular. Since last summer Iran has been delivering of short and medium range ballistic missiles to the PMUs. If fired from southern and western Iraq, these missiles could reach Riyadh and possibly Tel Aviv. They are Iran’s main deterrent to a U.S.-Israeli-Saudi attack and thus a threat to Israeli freedom of action in the region.
“The logic was to have a backup plan if Iran was attacked,” an Iranian official told Reuters. “The number of missiles is not high, just a couple of dozen, but it can be increased if necessary.”
Since January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pressured the Iraqi government to order the dissolution of the Iranian-sponsored Popular Mobilization Units. The PMUs, as they are known, are the Shia militias that led a successful fight to drive ISIS out of western Iraq in 2017. They are Iraqi versions of Hezbollah combining Iranian-trained military forces with political fronts. (The bombings attributed to Israelis all targeted PMU facilities.)
The PMUs are controversial in Iraq. While hailed for their role in fighting ISIS, their subsequent expansion into domestic politics was not. Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the nation’s religious leader, blessed the PMUs’ war on ISIS with a fatwa in 2014 but openly opposed their electoral list in 2018.
Nonetheless, the PMUs’ political alliance, known as Fateh, finished second in Iran’s 2018 parliamentary election and helped select Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. According to Iranian news reports, Pompeo made it clear in a January meeting with Abdul-Mahdi that Washington would not react to Israeli attacks against the PMUs.
As Iraq incorporates the PMUs—and there are more than 40 of them—into its armed forces, Iran is bolstering their independence. During the recent meeting in Tehran, a spokesman for one PMU, the Hezbollah al-Nujaba Movement, said any government in Iraq that stands against Iran will be overthrown in a matter of weeks.
That threat is overstated, but the influence of the PMUs is not. They helped save the country when ISIS erupted in 2014. They wield “significant political and military power,” according to the Jamestown Foundation, a security think tank that is hostile to Iran. Despite Pompeo’s pressure, their dissolution is “quite unlikely.”
Thanks to Trump’s policy, the incentives for Iraq to side with Iran are growing. No Iraqi government can afford to be seen making common cause with Israel. When Israel announced last week it would join a U.S. coalition to protect Persian Gulf maritime traffic, the pro-American government in Iraq spurned the idea. Iraq “rejects any participation of forces of the Zionist entity in any military force to secure passage of ships in the Arabian Gulf,” said Foreign Minister Mohammed Ali al-Hakim.
“Iraq will work to lower tensions in our region through calm negotiations,” al-Hakim said, while “the presence of Western forces in the region would raise tensions.” As a result of Trump’s “maximum pressure,” Iraq had adopted the message of the U.S.-sanctioned Iranian diplomat Javad Zarif: the U.S. campaign against Iran is a menace, and “only regional nations can make regional peace.”
The U.S. alliance with Israel comes with a high political price that Trump appears willing to pay. The secret attacks may enhance Israeli security; they also serve to isolate Washington from its Iraqi allies. The attacks may degrade Iran militarily; they also bolster Iran’s standing politically. They may make Israelis nominally safer. They also make the remaining 5,200-plus U.S. troops in Iraq more vulnerable.
In short, the secret Israeli attacks increase the chances that any U.S.-Iran war will be fought in Iraq, where the U.S. intervention proved to be a disaster 15 years ago. And there’s no reason to think the Israeli attacks won’t continue.

"The message from the Bouman backlash is that if you are a woman who becomes the face of a massive scientific breakthrough, sexist internet trolls will spend way too much of their time harassing you and trying to disprove your credibility.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/how-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole-turned-into-a-lesson-on-sexism-in-stem/,alternet,gender,left,69.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"This article originally appeared at Salon.
On April 10, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) presented the first-ever direct image of a black hole. The blurry composite embodied over two centuries of advances in mathematics, science and electronics. Prior to the image, only artistic illustrations were available to depict the mysterious singularities that warp the spacetime continuum by virtue of their huge masses, producing such gravitational force that not even light can escape. Shortly after the EHT presentation, MIT tweeted an image of Katie Bouman, a 29-year-old computer scientist whose work was crucial to the project, during the moment the first black hole was processed.
“Here’s the moment when the first black hole image was processed, from the eyes of researcher Katie Bouman,” MIT’s largest research lab, the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab, said on Twitter.
Bouman, a postdoctoral fellow with the Event Horizon Telescope and a forthcoming Assistant Professor in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at the California Institute of Technology, looked ecstatic in the photograph sitting in front of her computer, her hands covering her mouth in awe. The photograph instantly made her the face of the project — which is why an informal coterie of sexist trolls kicked off a sexist investigation to invalidate her contributions.
A familiar story arc followed. Fake Twitter accounts were set up in her name. Men on Twitter dismissed her scientific contributions as mere feminist posturing. And there was a debate over whether or not she was worthy of a Wikipedia page.
It is hard to imagine the same response would have followed if a white man was in that picture instead of Bouman. Salon reached out to Bouman for an interview, but a representative for MIT said she was no longer taking interviews with the press.
It is no secret that women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. According to 2016 statistics, women represent only 30 percent of the STEM workforce. Often their contributions go unnoticed, as history has shown us. For example, when people think about the mission that brought Apollo to the moon they most likely think of astronaut Neil Armstrong, not, say, Margaret Hamilton, who developed the on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. Placing Bouman at the center of the discovery may have been a conscious optics choice for the MIT research lab, given how STEM fields are often criticized for a lack of gender equality, but the public backlash was almost certainly unanticipated.
Amid the chaos, Bouman wrote in a Facebook post: “No one algorithm or person made this image, it required the amazing talent of a team of scientists from around the globe and years of hard work to develop the instrument, data processing, imaging methods, and analysis techniques that were necessary to pull off this seemingly impossible feat. It has been truly an honor, and I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you all.”
Her response was gracious, and emphasized how big scientific projects happen through collective collaboration. As many have pointed out, her response brings to light the false glorification of the “lone genius” trope in STEM, in which one person is responsible for an ingenious creation. (Even Isaac Newton was famously was uncomfortable with the way he was treated as a singular hero for contemplating gravitation; “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” he wrote in a letter to fellow natural philosopher Robert Hooke.) Over 200 people worked on the black hole imaging project, and Bouman bringing this to the attention of the public was not an attempt to deflect her credibility or contributions, but to rather remind people that something this monumental in the science world can’t happen without a lot of brains. As Bouman described in her 2016 TED Talk, she likened herself to a forensic sketch artist, but instead she created an algorithm to image a mystery in the universe.
Yet the worst thing about this entire saga is that it may instill fear in young women who want to pursue a career in STEM. The message from the Bouman backlash is that if you are a woman who becomes the face of a massive scientific breakthrough, sexist internet trolls will spend way too much of their time harassing you and trying to disprove your credibility.
Women often face harassment on various social media platforms — especially in professions like journalism and politics, where they are in the public eye. How we move forward is unclear, as such abusive incidents are apt to inspire many to cease using social media platforms entirely, à la Kelly Marie Tran.","['internet', 'trolls', 'sexist']"
"Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trump-is-desperate-and-encouraging-violence-from-his-superfans/,alternet,gun-control,left,69.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it. Unencumbered by normal human qualities like empathy or conscience, Trump can bounce from one awful behavior from another — grifting, sexual assault and harassment, racism, lying, conspiracy-mongering, criminal schemes — with astonishing speed, doing more wicked deeds in a day that what most aspiring villains can accomplish in a year or even a lifetime.
In an effort to get a handle on the endless deluge of awfulness pouring out of Trump, it’s become common to describe some of the godawful things he does as “distractions” from other awful things he does. It’s an effort to triage our response, apparently on the theory that figuring out which Trump evils rank higher than others can somehow sharpen our efforts to process and resist them. It’s an honorable desire based in empirical evidence: Indeed, Trump sometimes does or says nasty things to divert public and media attention from other nasty things he does or says. Unfortunately, this often fails to understand that the nasty stuff Trump does to distract us from other nasty stuff is incredibly dangerous on its own terms, and can’t just be shrugged off as a pure or content-free distraction.
Today’s case in point: Trump, who has frequently indulged in late-night binges of Twitter vitriol while most Americans are asleep, was at it again late on Wednesday night when he decided to promote a video by a cowboy cosplayer and Trump superfan named Couy Griffin declaring, “The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.”
“Thank you Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!” Trump said of the video, which echoed a 19th-century slogan — “the only good Indian is a dead Indian” — used to justify genocide against Native Americans.
So far, however, the mainstream media reaction has been a big, fat shrug. And it’s easy to see why. Indeed, it’s fair to argue that Trump’s trolling antics of late are an attempt to distract attention from the real-world disaster unfolding in this country, largely due to his negligence. The U.S. has officially crossed mark of 100,000 dead from COVID-19. More than 40 million people who have filed for unemployment. Trump has entirely given up on even pretending to have any national strategy for fighting the virus, beyond demanding that states “reopen” ASAP to let the virus wash over us and kill untold thousands more.
“This whole thing is a distraction, and you know it,” Chris Cuomo of CNN said on Wednesday night, adding that Trump stirs the pot with this hateful nonsense to distract “from the dead and the dire situation that [he’s] basically ignoring.”
On Thursday morning, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has been fending off Trump’s vile and baseless murder accusations in recent weeks, made a similar point. Trump defames him and others, Scarborough said, to distract us from the fact that he ignored or neglected the coronavirus pandemic for months. He would rather have people “talk about how vile his tweets are or how dangerous his fight with Twitter is” than about the 100,000 dead.
Neither Cuomo nor Scarborough was talking specifically about Trump tweeting out violent rhetoric toward Democrats — Cuomo’s segment aired shortly bit before Trump did that — but about the mountainous garbage fire of the president’s Twitter feed in general, of which this threatening rhetoric was just a small piece. Trump is absolutely throwing out whatever he can in a desperate bid to regain control of the conversation so that his massive failures aren’t the focus. That’s led to at least two nights where he stayed up late and sent more than 100 tweets, in hopes of coughing up something outrageous enough to seize the headlines.
So it’s true that these things are blatant distractions. But it doesn’t follow that the best approach is necessarily to ignore Trump’s childish behavior. The fact the president of the United States is encouraging domestic terrorism against “Democrats” — not just against specific politicians, which would be bad enough, but against anyone who identifies as a Democrat — is not a small thing. On the contrary, it’s incredibly dangerous.
It wasn’t all that long ago, though it may seem like another epoch, when a domestic terrorist apparently set out to murder Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the staffers at CNN — among others — with mail bombs, because he loved Trump so much. In fact, the president’s level of plausible deniability was higher then: That was before Trump had openly called for such violence. Now there’s an army of angry reactionaries with guns — whom Trump has eagerly encouraged with his “LIBERATE” tweets — who hang on his every word and appear ready to escalate to open armed insurrection. It’s undeniable that at least a few people, and perhaps more than that, will interpret this as a push to lash out with targeted violence in the middle of an election year. The only real question is how widespread that violence will be.
Let’s not fool ourselves here. In the video Trump tweeted, Griffin pivots from his incendiary language to claim that he only wishes Democrats dead “in a political sense.” This falls somewhere between legalistic ass-covering and standard-issue gaslighting, with Griffin trying to hoodwink people into ignoring what he said just moments before. He’s trying to have his right-wing shitposting cake and eat it too, openly encouraging violence while also trying to evade responsibility with digressive, rambling explanations of how you can’t believe he really means what he just said.
But Griffin means it, and Trump does too. As Will Sommer of The Daily Beast found when he interviewed Griffin, the guy does a piss-poor job at disguising his obvious longing for violent retribution against Democrats, who he believes have no legitimate claim to representation in politics.
“You get to pick your poison: you either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope,” Griffin said of Democratic governors, right after claiming he wasn’t seriously proposing killing anyone. When asked whether anti-lockdown protesters were considering violence, Griffin said, “There’s not an option that’s not on the table.”
Like Donald Trump, Griffin’s an obvious coward who wants to push violent rhetoric but isn’t willing to face the consequences for doing so. By pushing Griffin’s speech, Trump is engaging in stochastic terrorism, in which a prominent voice puts out the suggestion of radical violence, but refuses to acknowledge any responsibility if and when someone else acts on it.
Trump is desperate and clinging to anything he can use, including threats of violence, to scare Democratic voters away from the polls in November. Since the presidential election is our last available mechanism to remove Trump and replace him with someone vaguely sane and competent, this is no small thing. In the age of the coronavirus, in fact, replacing Trump with someone competent is more important than ever. It’s quite literally the only hope this country has of saving lives and saving our economy.
There’s a way to call out Trump’s violent trolling while also keeping the focus on the rising numbers of dead and unemployed. It’s about going meta — pointing out not just the facts of Trump’s behavior, but why he’s doing the things he does.
That’s actually what Cuomo and Scarborough did in their TV segments, ironically enough. Neither man is actually ignoring Trump’s Twitter antics. They highlight that stuff while also explaining to viewers the not-so-hidden purpose of such trolling: Trying to divert attention away from the 100,000 dead and 40 million unemployed. Their segments are good examples of how to walk and chew gum at the same time. They’re not taking the “ignore his antics and he’ll go away” approach. Rather, they’re doing what all journalists should be doing, which is closer to a both/and approach — calling out Trump’s often violent and mendacious distractions while also highlighting the real toll of his leadership failures on the American people.
That’s what everyone in media should be doing. Ignoring Trump won’t make him go away. He is still president, unfortunately. He will always have a direct line to his followers, and now he’s using that connection to deliver unsubtle hints that they should use violence to prevent Democrats from voting him out of office. He’s also playing the same game with his false accusations against Scarborough, creating a permission structure for some lunatic with a gun who wants to avenge his orange godhead against the “fake news.”
Sadly, men with guns who want to hurt you isn’t a problem we can just ignore away.
We can focus instead not just on what Trump is doing but why he’s doing it. What: Using incendiary rhetoric in hopes of inspire his followers to take violent action on his behalf. Why: Because he’s becoming aware that, thanks to his massive failures as president, he probably can’t keep power through nonviolent and legal means. Donald Trump’s increasingly dangerous flirtation with using mob violence to subvert democracy isn’t a small story. It must be covered, but covered carefully — and always by pointing toward the dark goals he hopes to accomplish with this vile behavior.","['chaos', 'monster', 'shovels', 'crap']"

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — President Donald Trump accused Democrats of “politicizing” the deadly coronavirus during a campaign rally here on Friday, claiming that the outbreak is “their new hoax” as he continued to downplay the risk in the U.S.
“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” Trump said. “They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.”
“This is their new hoax,” Trump continued, adding that attacking the White House’s response to the coronavirus had become the Democratic Party’s “single talking point.”
Trump has weaponized the word “hoax” throughout his presidency, using it to belittle and discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference as well as his impeachment trial. He also has a long history of distrusting experts, most notably his own intelligence community and government scientists.
“Democrats will always say horrible things,"" Trump said. ""Democrats want us to fail so badly.”
Trump — who has been criticized for painting an overly rosy picture of the outbreak, often contradicting his own health officials — insisted on Friday that his administration was “magnificently organized” and “totally prepared"" to address the virus.

""My administration has taken the most aggressive acts in history to prevent the spread in the United States,"" Trump said, touting his decision to ban foreign nationals recently in China from entering the U.S.
Trump again drew a misleading comparison between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu, telling his supporters that ""35,000 on average each year die from the flu, that's a lot of people.""
“So far we have lost nobody to coronavirus,"" Trump said, suggesting the growing global panic was due to the press being in a ""hysteria mode.""
Experts say that the coronavirus is significantly more contagious than the flu and a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away.
Trump faced bipartisan pressure after he requested $2.5 billion in coronavirus response funding, which lawmakers from both parties said wasn't enough. He later said that if Congress wants to grant additional funds, ""I'll take it.""
More than 83,000 people have been sickened by the coronavirus and at least 2,857 have died since the start of January when the virus was first discovered in China. As the virus spread rapidly across Europe and the Middle East this past week, Wall Street suffered its worst week since the financial crisis.

Trump, who ran on a promise to build a southern border wall, used the outbreak as another opportunity to attack Democrats' position on immigration and border security.
“We must understand that border security is also health security,” Trump added, as rallygoers chanted “build the wall.” “The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”
Trump’s rally in South Carolina comes on the eve of the Democratic primary here on Saturday, and it's the latest example of the president’s counterprogramming strategy to hold large events where Democrats are campaigning and voting, competing with them for media attention.","['weaponized', 'belittle', 'and', 'discredit']"
"After Stephen Miller's white nationalist views outed, Latinos ask, 'where's the GOP outrage?'",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/after-stephen-miller-s-white-nationalist-views-outed-latinos-ask-n1096071,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,70.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It wasn't the content of White House adviser Stephen Miller’s leaked emails that shocked Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from El Paso, Texas, but the silence of her Republican colleagues that has followed.
Miller is the architect of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies that have separated children from parents, forced people seeking asylum in the U.S. to wait in Mexico under squalid conditions, instituted the Muslim ban and poured money from the military into border wall construction. The administration is currently under fire for the deaths of migrant children and teens who have died while in government custody.
In a trove of emails provided to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, Miller cited and promoted white nationalist ideologies of white genocide, immigrants as criminals and eugenics, all of which were once considered fringe and extreme. White nationalists embrace white supremacist and white separatist views.
Three weeks after the emails were made public, Miller still is in the White House. Only Democrats have called on the White House to rid itself of white nationalism.
“It really has been jarring (that) the president’s enablers and Republicans have not stood up and said, Mr. President, this is unacceptable,” Escobar said in an interview. “I would implore my Republican colleagues to join us in calling for Stephen Miller’s resignation,” she said.
MIller's ideology has wide reach, consequences
Escobar represents El Paso, where a gunman opened fire in a Walmart on Aug. 3, killing 22 people and injuring 26.
Police have said the suspect in the El Paso shootings told them his target was “Mexicans.” They also said he posted an anti-immigrant, anti-Latino screed that stated the attack was a “response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."" Some of the language in the screed is considered similar to words used by the president and state leaders.
After the shootings, Trump condemned white supremacy and said “hate has no place in America"" but did not mention that Latinos were targeted or that the victims were predominantly Latino in his speech.
Miller is more than helping reshape immigration policy.
With Miller's assistance, the administration is ""doing an end run around Congress to dismantle every aspect of the immigration system"" through executive actions and gutting regulations and replacing them with their own, said Doug Rand, an immigration policy adviser in the Obama White House and cofounder of Boundless Immigration, which uses technology to help immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship.

""Believe it or not, it's possible to be to the right of President Trump on immigration, and that's where Stephen Miller has spent his whole career,"" Rand said. ""He idealizes the 1924 law that banned immigrants from just about everywhere but Western Europe, and he is pulling every lever he can find throughout the federal government to accomplish the same outcome.""
Escobar has asked the Department of Homeland Security to audit its policies to determine which were influenced by Miller ""to show the motivations of the administration's immigration policies and shed light on the people that help craft them.""
Separately, 107 members of Congress signed a letter to Trump demanding he fire Miler.

""A documented white nationalist has no place in any administration, and especially not in such an influential position,"" the Democratic congressional members said in the letter.
There also are several petitions calling for Miller’s resignation, including one started by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that had more than 130,000 signatures as of this week.
Miller previously worked for former Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. — who served as Trump’s first attorney general — before joining the Trump campaign.
More tolerance for intolerance?
That he persists reflects a change in what the country and political leaders are willing to tolerate under a Trump administration.
At the start of the year, House Republicans removed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, from committee assignments after he said in an interview with The New York Times: “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”
When he said in 2013 that young immigrants had calves the size of cantaloupes, King drew condemnation from throughout the party, including from Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and former Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Florida Republicans. King has been repeatedly re-elected and is a Trump ally.
Diaz-Balart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the three most senior Latino Republicans in Congress, either didn’t respond or declined to comment on the calls for Miller’s resignation.
Rubio and Diaz-Balart, both from immigrant families, have a moderate record on immigration. Miller even targeted Rubio in emails to get negative stories written about him by Breitbart. Rubio's response has been that he knew Miller wasn't a fan of his immigration policies.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment. The White House has defended Miller in previous statements to media, raising Miller’s Jewish background in that defense.
Ocasio-Cortez dismissed that defense in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes saying ""the color of your skin and the identity you are born with does not absolve you of moral wrong.""
""I don't think any public servant should weaponize their identity in order to advance white nationalist ideas. Period. Punto. I don't care who you are,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. Having Miller at the helm of U.S. immigration policy means policies “will become more fascistic and we cannot allow that to be us,"" she said.
A rise in violent, white supremacist extremism
In his emails, Miller makes clear the esteem he holds for another period in the country, when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Immigration Act of 1924 that severely restricted immigration from certain parts of the world. Coolidge is admired by white nationalists, according to the SPLC.
The act was the nation's first comprehensive restrictive immigration policy that established the Border Patrol.
After being told that Fox radio host Mark Levin has said there should be no immigration for several years ""for assimilation purposes,"" Miller responds:
""Like Coolidge did. Kellyanne Conway poll says that is exactly what most Americans want after 40 years of non-stop record arrivals,"" according to emails posted by SPLC. Conway is an adviser to Trump.
In referencing the 1924 act, Miller is ""harkening to an era of racial violence,"" said Monica Muñoz Martinez, author of ""The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas.""
FBI statistics released in November showed an increase in hate crimes and violence against Latinos.
In a September report, the Department of Homeland Security said while the country still faces threats from foreign terrorist organizations, “unfortunately, the severity and number of domestic threats have also grown.”
The agency said there has been a “concerning” rise in attacks by people motivated by racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism, including white supremacist violent extremism, anti-government and anti-authority violent extremism and other ideologies.
White supremacist violent extremists can generally be characterized by hatred for immigrants and ethnic minorities, often combining these prejudices with virulent anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim views, the DHS report states.
In a Sept. 6, 2015, email, Miller suggested Breitbart write about “The Camp of the Saints,” SPLC reported. The novel's theme is the end of white civilization by migrants who arrive from India.
Kathleen Belew, an expert on the white-power movement, said in an interview with NPR that Miller’s citation of the book is “clear evidence that this is a person who is immersed in trafficking in white nationalist ideology.”
“Voters across the country, constituents across the country who see their leaders standing in silence in the face of unprecedented racism and bigotry at the highest levels of government in our generation, they need to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves: Is this acceptable?” Escobar said.

Russia's prime minister and its entire government resigned Wednesday as part of sweeping constitutional changes that could see President Vladimir Putin extend his hold on power.
In his annual state of the nation speech, Putin said he favored changing the constitution to hand the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, the power to choose Russia's prime minister and other key positions.
""Of course, these are very serious changes to the political system,"" Putin said, adding that he thought the parliament and the civil society were ready for the changes.
""It would increase the role and significance of the country's parliament ... of parliamentary parties, and the independence and responsibility of the prime minister.""
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Putin's longtime trusted ally, said Wednesday that the government he heads was resigning to give the president room to carry out the changes he wants to make to the constitution.

Medvedev made the announcement on state television, sitting next to Putin who thanked him for his work.
Putin said that Medvedev would take on a new job as the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, which the president currently chairs.
He also nominated tax chief Mikhail Mishustin to serve as the new prime minister, the Russian state news agency TASS reported.
Putin also asked for the outgoing government to remain at work until a new government was appointed.

Despite the proposed changes, Putin said Russia should remain a strong presidential republic, with the president remaining in charge of setting the parliament's priorities, the Russian army and law enforcement.
But he stressed the need for public discussion and called for a nationwide vote on the changes.
“The opinion of the people as the main source of power should be defining,” Putin said. “People decide everything in the end.”
Members of the audience including ministers and high-ranking officials, listened carefully — some taking notes.
Putin, who has been in power for almost two decades as either president or prime minister, is due to complete his fourth presidential term in 2024, after which the constitution would bar him from immediately running for president again.
Medvedev was widely regarded as a ""placeholder president"" when he took the top job between 2008 and 2012, allowing Putin to serve as the prime minister and observe constitutional term limits.
The latest changes highlight the importance of Medvedev to Putin, said Emily Ferris, a Russia research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank.
""Medvedev’s political demise has been predicted for several years now, but he is yet to leave the scene,"" Ferris said. ""This latest decision indicates that Medvedev has been offered a future in politics, and the message seems to be that Putin loyalists will be rewarded.""
The move follows months of speculation in the Russian media about whether Putin will attempt to stay in power beyond 2024 without changing the constitution or forming a unified state with friendly neighbor Belarus.
Critics have suggested he is considering various options to remain at the helm, including by shifting power to parliament and then assuming an enhanced role as prime minister after he steps down in four years.
Another option often mentioned is his heading a state council, a body that Putin said Wednesday he thought should be given more powers under the constitution.
Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Finance Committee, said Putin had ""emphasized that the people are waiting for changes.""
""These tasks can only be solved if you respond to the requests of the population,"" he told TASS. ""And the demands of the population are a request for change. Apparently, he felt it necessary to respond to this request in this way.""
Alexei Navalny, one of the most vocal opposition leaders and an anti-corruption activist, tweeted in response to Putin's announcement: “The main point of Putin’s message: what kind of idiots (and/or crooks) are all those who said Putin will leave in 2024. Remaining a life-long only leader, taking ownership of the entire country, appropriating its wealth for himself and his friends — that is the only goal of Putin and his regime.""
Navalvny has for years been accusing Putin and his entourage of rampant corruption.
In a widely anticipated win, Putin was re-elected in 2018 with 77 percent of the vote.
He remains popular with many Russians, although his trust ratings have taken a beating after the introduction of a very unpopular pension reform in 2018.
A public opinion poll released Wednesday by the Levada Center, Russia's only major independent pollster, showed that 53 percent of Russians would vote for Putin in the next presidential election, a drop from 70 percent compared to January 2018.","['beating', 'unpopular']"
He lied about matters large and small. He refused to shake House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's outstretched hand. He talked up a divisive culture war.,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/strategy-laid-bare-trump-sees-value-national-division-n1131336,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,70.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"At an event in Michigan last week, Donald Trump referenced the U.S. House vote on impeachment and how pleased he was with the final vote tally. ""We won 196 to nothing,"" the president said. For emphasis, he added soon after, ""196 to nothing.""
In reality, the vote on the first article of impeachment was 230 to 197, while the vote on the second article was 229 to 198. But in Trump's mind, it was a shutout in the other direction -- because the votes from the Democrats and Congress' lone independent, in a rather literal sense, didn't count.
I thought of this watching Donald Trump's State of the Union address because it was a continuation of the theme: the president seems vaguely aware of the existence of his political opponents, but he's convinced himself that they simply don't count, and as a consequence, there's no point in acknowledging them, reaching out to them, or trying to find common ground with them.
In 2020, the state of our union is bitter, but that's not an accident of circumstance; it's the end result of a deliberate strategy, hatched by a president who believes toxicity works in his favor.

I don't generally see political developments the way the Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan does, but her reaction to Donald Trump's State of the Union rang true:
""This is a big night, a cleaved down the middle night with no one trying to hide the divide. No ameliorating courtesy, no enacting of formal regard. Just the great divide, unhidden and out there for all the world to see.""
There was no meaningful pretext. The president, poised to be acquitted in an impeachment trial led in part by Senate jurors who've acknowledged his guilt, saw value last night in trying to tear the country apart -- confident that his chunk would be bigger than his rivals'.
He lied about matters large and small. He refused to shake House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's outstretched hand. He talked up a divisive culture war. He saw no need to extend an olive branch to his partisan foes -- those who happen to hold the majority of one chamber of Congress -- because he apparently didn't care if they were inclined to accept it.
When First Lady Melania Trump put the nation's highest civilian honor around the neck of a right-wing media personality, it served as an oddly appropriate capstone to the president's broader goals. The New York Times reported:
In an unusual departure from protocol, Rush Limbaugh was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Trump during the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, one day after the conservative talk show host revealed that he had advanced lung cancer. Mr. Limbaugh, 69, sat next to the first lady, Melania Trump, in the gallery of the House of Representatives, where he joined Venezuela's opposition leader, a top border patrol agent and several other guests of Mr. Trump.... The first lady presented the medal, which is usually bestowed during a ceremony at the White House, to Mr. Limbaugh.
Limbaugh's rhetorical record is too lengthy to review in a single blog post, but a compelling Media Matters' assessment noted that Trump ""conferred one of the nation's great civilian honors upon a man who has trafficked in hate and is responsible for some of the most vile degradations of the nation's political discourse.""
As disappointing as it may be to see the president cheapen the Medal of Freedom -- again -- it wasn't exactly surprising. Limbaugh is on Trump's ""team,"" and last night's national address was intended to send a signal that the president is indifferent to those who are not.
It's also a sign of things to come. Election Day is 39 weeks away, and Trump used his State of the Union address to signal his intentions: the next nine months will be devoted to motivating the Republican Party's far-right base, ensuring they're both satisfied and electrified.
Buckle up.

Trump proceeded to ignore multiple other attempts made over subsequent weeks by his advisers and Republican allies to get him to take the pandemic seriously. Instead he dismissed their warnings as “alarmist” and would go on to hold a number of rallies (seven) and golfing outings (three) between learning of Obama’s pandemic playbook and ultimately declaring a national emergency.,https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/the-science-is-clear-trumps-handling-of-the-pandemic-was-disastrous/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,70.0,2.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"Let us pretend, for the sake of argument, that all of the other terrible things that Donald Trump has done during his presidency never happened: the persecution of immigrants and handouts to the wealthy, the destruction of our environment, his attacks on free speech rights and endless scandals. Even if one could look the other way on all of that and more, the unavoidable reality remains that Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic — completely on its own and without regard to any other policy issue — has been serious enough to justify deeming his administration to be an abject, unforgivable failure.
Trump supporters obviously don’t want to admit this. If you turn on Fox News, read Breitbart and The Daily Wire or browse through the cesspools of YouTube or Reddit, you’ll find plenty of people who spin or defend Trump’s bungling. Yet to quote John Adams (a president far superior to Trump in every way), “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”
The most recent piece of evidence is a study conducted by a research team led by the University of Arizona evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey. By analyzing existing genomic data from the coronavirus, the scientists concluded that “the virus associated with the first known transmission network in the US did not enter the country until mid-February.” They call the finding “sobering,” noting that “it demonstrates that the window of opportunity to block sustained transmission of the virus stretched all the way until that point.”
In other words, although the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States was reported in Washington state on January 20, “rapid interventions successfully prevented onward transmission” in that individual’s case. Patient zero in the United States most likely entered the country at some point around mid-February, meaning that if Trump had paid attention to the warning signs at that time — of which, as we soon shall see, there were many — he could have implemented measures that saved thousands of lives when the virus inevitably broke out here.
He did not do so, and as a result the number of pandemic-related deaths in this country is likely to soon match that of American fatalities during World War I.
Trump had abundant opportunities to prepare us for a pandemic before the coronavirus reached our shores. Previously, President George W. Bush had the foresight to warn us about a possible pandemic, and to try to prepare for it, back in 2005. Trump did not take any of these concerns seriously. During the first year of Trump’s presidency he ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop the pandemic modeling that it had done in conjunction with national laboratories since 2005, and proposed a 20 percent budget cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2018 he proposed $900 million in budget cuts to the CDC, removed a member of his national security team who had advocated a complete biodefense plan in the event of a pandemic, and disbanded the global health national security team. By 2019 he was allowing 2,109 ventilators (equalling 21 percent of the Strategic National Stockpile’s inventory) to become unusable, eliminating a U.S. Agency for International Development program that existed to warn America about possible public health threats and ignoring a warning from the Council of Economic Advisors that a pandemic could kill up to half a million Americans.
Then 2020 arrived. Trump reportedly was initially warned about the coronavirus outbreak by intelligence officers on January 3. His first substantial briefing on the coronavirus occurred 15 days later, with Secretary of Health and Human Services Alexander Azar describing Trump as distracted by a desire to crack down on vaping and characterizing concerns about the pandemic as “alarmist.” After the first confirmed case was made public, Trump told a televised audience that “we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” On that same day he refused to implement policy recommendations in a “pandemic playbook” developed by President Barack Obama’s administration that would have protected the American workforce.
Trump proceeded to ignore multiple other attempts made over subsequent weeks by his advisers and Republican allies to get him to take the pandemic seriously. Instead he dismissed their warnings as “alarmist” and would go on to hold a number of rallies (seven) and golfing outings (three) between learning of Obama’s pandemic playbook and ultimately declaring a national emergency. To make it clear that he was not concerned about the pandemic during this period, Trump’s budget proposal — which was released on February 10 — called for “cutting Health and Human Services funding by $9.5 billion, including a 15 percent cut of $1.2 billion to the CDC and a $35 million decrease to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund’s annual contribution.” On February 14 he ignored a memo jointly written by Health and Human Services and the National Security Council that called for “significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone.” It also called for school closures, stay-at-home orders and advocating nearly universal telework.
Less than a week later Trump allowed 14 Americans infected with the coronavirus on a cruise ship to return to the United States despite CDC warnings not to do so. When Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned Americans to prepare for a possible outbreak, Trump was so angered by the subsequent stock market crash that he cancelled a planned coronavirus task force briefing. Instead he continued reassuring the public, claiming on February 26 that the cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,” insisting on March 2 that “we’re talking about a much smaller range” of deaths than the flu and saying on March 6 that the pandemic was an “unforeseen problem” that “came out of nowhere.” On March 10 a Trump official said the administration continued to stand by its proposed budget cuts to the CDC, while on the same day Trump himself praised the “great job” his administration was doing in handling the crisis and reassured Americans “it will go away” and “it’s really working out.”
Three days later, he declared a national emergency — more than 10 weeks after he was first informed of the situation.
Since that time Trump has passed on pseudoscientific claims about hydroxychloroquine, a drug he touts as a treatment (and in which he has a financial stake — he has a small personal interest in Sanofi, a French company that makes the drug’s brand-name version). He has wrongly passed the buck of blame to the Obama administration by lying about their policies and his own. He has made a number of premature attempts to reopen the economy; notably, he said the country would be “raring to go by Easter”, then expressed solidarity with protesters opposing their state’s stay-at-home orders by tweeting that their governments should “liberate” them. Soon after, he threatened to override governors who kept houses of worship closed (which he lacks the authority to do). Trump mocked his Democratic opponent in the presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden, for wearing a face mask while refusing to don one himself. He has suggested that people inject themselves with disinfectant (later insisting he was joking) and threatened to hold up funding as punishment to states that try to expand access to mail-in voting, which some experts believe will hurt Trump’s reelection chances. He hasn’t done nearly enough to manufacture tests, protect workers or make sure that contact tracing prevents further spread of the disease.
The bottom line is that Trump failed to prepare America for the pandemic for more than two months after he was made aware of it. After he finally declared a national emergency, he refused to offer more than erratic and incompetent leadership. And it is not just observation — scientists and research like the aforementioned study seem clear on this point.
“He should have been warning us it was coming,” Dr. William Haseltine, a biologist, told Salon in March. “He should have been preparing by stockpiling all the necessary equipment. But even today we’re not doing what we should do. Let me put it that way. What we should be doing is contact tracing [identifying people who may have come in contact with infected patients] and having mandatory quarantines for everybody who’s been exposed. And quarantining not at home, but in hotel rooms, single occupancy hotel rooms.”
By failing to understand the science or listen to scientists, Trump has also cost millions of Americans their livelihoods. As the Center for American Progress points out, countries that implemented adequate worker protections and early testing only saw modest increases in unemployment: South Korea from 3.3 percent in February to 3.8 percent in April, Australia from 5.1 percent in February to 6.2 percent in April, Germany from 5 percent in February to 5.8 percent in April. America, by contrast, saw its unemployment rate skyrocket from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, meaning that roughly 17 to 18 million more Americans would have their jobs right now if America’s unemployment rate had only increased on par with those of more competent countries. Incidentally, while more than 107,000 Americans have died so far and more than 1.8 million are confirmed to have been infected, under 12,000 people have been infected in South Korea (273 deaths), less than 190,000 have been infected in Germany (8,602 deaths) and less than 8,000 have been infected in Australia (102 deaths). For the United States, that equals 32.45 out of every 100,000 people, compared to 10.33 out of 100,000 in Germany, 0.41 out of 100,000 in Australia and 0.53 out of 100,000 in South Korea.
If you don’t care about the millions of people who have lost their jobs and the hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives because of Trump’s incompetence, that is your right. If you decide to vote for Trump because there are things he has done as president which you support, or because you feel Biden would be much worse, that is also your right. If you think expert political scientists like Allan Lichtman are wrong when they point out that this crisis makes it more likely than not that Trump will lose in November, that is your right as well. Everyone is entitled to their opinion on whether they think Trump deserves a second term as president or will win one.
No one, however, is entitled to deny scientific evidence. And the facts and evidence make it clear that, scientifically speaking, America’s pandemic crisis is Trump’s fault.","['ignore', 'dismissed']"
"The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/08/how-secret-israeli-attacks-in-iraq-are-driving-trumps-anti-iran-campaign/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,70.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, notes former CIA analyst Paul Pillar, is more obsession than strategy, and a not-so-mysterious explosion on the outskirts of Baghdad Monday shows why.
Iraqi political analysts are blaming the attack on Israel, saying it follows two attacks earlier this month on facilities of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. According to an Israeli news report, Israel launched the two attacks with U.S.-made F-35 jets.
Israel has long attacked Iranian-backed forces in Syria, an enemy of the United States. Now Israel has expanded its scope of operations to attack targets in Iraq, whose coalition government is friendly to the United States. The predictable result: the Iraqi government is bailing on Trump’s policy.
The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region. When things go wrong, a strategy can be rethought. An obsession can only ignore the warning signs.
The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen that was supposed to check Iran’s power is now in disarray. The bloody war that Trump continued, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is farther than ever from success.
The U.S.-backed Yemen war is losing allies, even among the Persian Gulf states that fear Iran. First, the United Arab Emirates announced it is now bailing out of the Yemen war effort. Then, separatist Yemeni forces, backed by the UAE, took the southern port city of Aden from the Saudi-backed forces. Saudi Arabia is now fighting another war in Yemen that has nothing to do with Iran. It’s a maximum mess.
In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is whispering in the ear of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.) Last month Germany refused to join a U.S.-led naval mission to the Persian Gulf aimed at deterring Iranian attacks, saying everything should be done to avoid escalation sought by Washington.
When it comes to “maximum pressure,” the international reaction is: “include me out”—except in Israel, and therein lies the danger for the U.S. government and the American people. Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran.
Iran is growing stronger across the region and in Iraq in particular. Since last summer Iran has been delivering of short and medium range ballistic missiles to the PMUs. If fired from southern and western Iraq, these missiles could reach Riyadh and possibly Tel Aviv. They are Iran’s main deterrent to a U.S.-Israeli-Saudi attack and thus a threat to Israeli freedom of action in the region.
“The logic was to have a backup plan if Iran was attacked,” an Iranian official told Reuters. “The number of missiles is not high, just a couple of dozen, but it can be increased if necessary.”
Since January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pressured the Iraqi government to order the dissolution of the Iranian-sponsored Popular Mobilization Units. The PMUs, as they are known, are the Shia militias that led a successful fight to drive ISIS out of western Iraq in 2017. They are Iraqi versions of Hezbollah combining Iranian-trained military forces with political fronts. (The bombings attributed to Israelis all targeted PMU facilities.)
The PMUs are controversial in Iraq. While hailed for their role in fighting ISIS, their subsequent expansion into domestic politics was not. Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the nation’s religious leader, blessed the PMUs’ war on ISIS with a fatwa in 2014 but openly opposed their electoral list in 2018.
Nonetheless, the PMUs’ political alliance, known as Fateh, finished second in Iran’s 2018 parliamentary election and helped select Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. According to Iranian news reports, Pompeo made it clear in a January meeting with Abdul-Mahdi that Washington would not react to Israeli attacks against the PMUs.
As Iraq incorporates the PMUs—and there are more than 40 of them—into its armed forces, Iran is bolstering their independence. During the recent meeting in Tehran, a spokesman for one PMU, the Hezbollah al-Nujaba Movement, said any government in Iraq that stands against Iran will be overthrown in a matter of weeks.
That threat is overstated, but the influence of the PMUs is not. They helped save the country when ISIS erupted in 2014. They wield “significant political and military power,” according to the Jamestown Foundation, a security think tank that is hostile to Iran. Despite Pompeo’s pressure, their dissolution is “quite unlikely.”
Thanks to Trump’s policy, the incentives for Iraq to side with Iran are growing. No Iraqi government can afford to be seen making common cause with Israel. When Israel announced last week it would join a U.S. coalition to protect Persian Gulf maritime traffic, the pro-American government in Iraq spurned the idea. Iraq “rejects any participation of forces of the Zionist entity in any military force to secure passage of ships in the Arabian Gulf,” said Foreign Minister Mohammed Ali al-Hakim.
“Iraq will work to lower tensions in our region through calm negotiations,” al-Hakim said, while “the presence of Western forces in the region would raise tensions.” As a result of Trump’s “maximum pressure,” Iraq had adopted the message of the U.S.-sanctioned Iranian diplomat Javad Zarif: the U.S. campaign against Iran is a menace, and “only regional nations can make regional peace.”
The U.S. alliance with Israel comes with a high political price that Trump appears willing to pay. The secret attacks may enhance Israeli security; they also serve to isolate Washington from its Iraqi allies. The attacks may degrade Iran militarily; they also bolster Iran’s standing politically. They may make Israelis nominally safer. They also make the remaining 5,200-plus U.S. troops in Iraq more vulnerable.
In short, the secret Israeli attacks increase the chances that any U.S.-Iran war will be fought in Iraq, where the U.S. intervention proved to be a disaster 15 years ago. And there’s no reason to think the Israeli attacks won’t continue.

But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.,https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/593581096/0/alternet_all~Alexandria-OcasioCortez-is-absolutely-right-%e2%80%94-there-shouldn%e2%80%99t-be-any-billionaires/,alternet,middle-class,left,71.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to harness the news cycle hasn’t died down one bit now that the newly-elected New York congresswoman has settled into office. Most of the AOC coverage over the past week continues to be TMZ-ified, focusing on Aaron Sorkin’s stuffed-shirt scolding of younger members of Congress and exaggerating Ocasio-Cortez’s supposed conflict with other Democrats.
The congressional freshman from the Bronx continues to calmly and unapologetically use her fame for good, however. She used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem.
On Monday, Ocasio-Cortez attended a symposium where author Ta-Nehisi Coates asked her if it was moral to have “a world that allows for billionaires.” Ocasio-Cortez swiftly said it was not. She hastened to note that individual billionaires, such as Bill Gates, may well be good people. But “a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong.”
AOC continued to hammer this point home later the same night on “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, explaining (yet again) that her proposed 70 percent marginal income tax rate would only be on money made above the first $10 million a year — and that a similar marginal tax rate reached 90% when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
“Do we want to live in a city where billionaires have their own personal Uber helipads,” she asked, “in the same city and same society as people who are working 80-hour weeks and can’t feed their kids?”
Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor.
On his own, the barely literate imbecile with no redeeming qualities who sits in the Oval Office claiming to be a billionaire (even if he probably isn’t) creates a one-man argument against the premise that wealth flows from merit. But the numbers increasingly back up Ocasio-Cortez’s argument that our system unjustly concentrating massive amounts of wealth in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of society with little to show for all their hard work and social contributions.
On Monday, Oxfam published a report showing that a mere 26 individual billionaires now have as much wealth between them as the least wealthy half of the human population. Which is to say, these 26 people have more money combined than 3.8 billion of the world’s population.
The idea that those 26 people are somehow being fairly rewarded by that massively unequal equation defies all common sense, especially as most billionaires have built their wealth on the labor of people who only take home a fraction of the value they add to the companies they work for.
It’s not just a matter of sour grapes. The billionaires saw their wealth rise by 12 percent in one year — the same year that saw the poorest half of the population lose 11 percent of their wealth, a loss that people who are already struggling to afford food, shelter and basic necessities simply cannot tolerate.
It’s not just that there seems to be a direct correlation between how much money the rich make and how little everyone else gets. There’s also evidence that vast inequalities stifle economic growth, and that redistribution of the sort that Ocasio-Cortez proposes can kickstart the economy. Money in the hands of working people is spent, and stimulates the economy, much more than money being hoarded by the wealthy few, after all. Inequality also breeds crime and other forms of social instability.
But mostly, this is a moral issue, and one of Ocasio-Cortez’s remarkable gifts as a communicator is her ability to speak about this issue in moral terms. Most people, of all wealth and income levels are hard workers. The fact that only a select few are amply rewarded while most others go wanting is both unfair and immoral. And the worse the problem gets, the more unavoidable this unfairness becomes.
Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed. This includes a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her.
The problem conservatives must face is that the very inequality they are defending is a rhetorical obstacle in itself. Most people recognize that it’s unfair that rich people make so much more money than the rest of us, and does not necessarily prove they have worked harder. Getting people to sign off on the idea that they simply are less worthy than their wealthier fellow citizens is not an easy lift, which is why Republicans prefer to stick to culture-war distractions, like fear-mongering over immigration or abortion.
Since Ocasio-Cortez first mentioned the 70 percent tax rate on CNN, a number of mansplaining journalists have written harrumphing pieces explaining that the “real” problem is tax loopholes or capital-gains tax rates set too low. This approach fails to understand the nature and purpose of Ocasio-Cortez’s political rhetoric. Any tax plan that raised marginal rates that high would almost certainly have other provisions to close loopholes or tax investments more fairly. But before we can get to that point, there must be more political momentum to change the tax system.
By focusing on marginal tax rates — which are easier to explain to the general public than most other taxation strategies — Ocasio-Cortez can help build a moral and social argument against economic inequality. Blunt statements, like saying that it’s immoral that billionaires exist at all, can help people reimagine a world where resources are distributed more equitably and ordinary people who work hard and drive economic growth can see their effort reflected in their paychecks.
Because the truth of the matter is that she’s right: We shouldn’t have billionaires. Any system that has a handful of ultra-wealthy individuals, by definition, is not rewarding hard work and social contributions fairly, or anywhere close to it. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that. But the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. Most people know that’s true, whatever their official “politics” may be, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny it.",['myth']
"Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.”",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trumps-refusal-to-wear-a-mask-isnt-just-vanity-its-a-manifestation-of-his-fascism/,alternet,coronavirus,left,71.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Despite knowing full well the furor that Vice President Mike Pence raised by not wearing a mask during a Mayo Clinic visit in late April, Donald Trump refused to wear a mask when visiting Honeywell factory in Arizona earlier this week — a factory that makes masks. This wasn’t just a symbolic nose-thumbing at people’s reasonable desire to be safe. Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were putting the lives of Honeywell employees in danger.
After all, masks are not primarily meant to protect the mask-wearer, but to protect others, since there’s clear evidence that people who are infected but have no symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Trump is regularly exposed to the virus, in fact — one of his personal valets just tested positive — and is a prime candidate to be such a carrier.
Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.”
“The president said doing so would make it seem like he is preoccupied with health instead of focused on reopening the nation’s economy,” the AP reporters write.
This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear. But there’s also good reason to believe that the Trump-Pence antipathy to wearing masks signals to something deeper and darker.
Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, in her friendly competition with fellow host Tucker Carlson to see who can be the most obnoxious, has started to demonize mask-wearing by claiming that public health advisories are somehow a conspiracy to sow “fear and intimidation.”
(Considering that mask-wearing to protect others took off in Asia long before Trump even ran for president, Ingraham’s conspiracy theory doesn’t possess even the most remote logical consistency.)
Between Trump and Fox News, the practice of mask-wearing is swiftly becoming another culture-war flashpoint. But the question is why. After all, masks seem to make people feel more comfortable with going out in public and going to work, and those are both things Trump dearly wants Americans to return to doing.
But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation. (Many have noted that this same argument could be made against the practice of wearing pants.)
Ultimately, the rejection of mask-wearing really goes back to the fact that Trump, Ingraham and their most faithful followers are guided by fascist impulse, even when they don’t or can’t articulate a fully fleshed-out fascist ideology. Above all other things, the fascist personality is one that rejects even the possibility of sickness. To wear a mask is to publicly admit that one’s body is suspectible to illness, which is coded as “weak” and therefore unacceptable.
Natascha Strobl, an Austrian political scientist who is an expert in far-right organizing and rhetoric, had an important English-language Twitter thread in early April about why the far right was embracing the view that the coronavirus should simply be allowed to run wild. From the beginning, this has been the view Trump clearly prefers on an emotional level and has pushed federal policy toward all along. While Strobl didn’t mention masks, her observations also help explain why these same folks are repulsed by mask-wearing.
The fascist narrative, Strobl explained, is that “men aren’t men anymore, but nervous, urban, overly intellectualized and (here it comes) sickly weaklings.
“Weakness is never worthy of protection and has to be cast out. This is fascism,” she continues. The fascist believes that those viewed as “weak” have an obligation to die “without protest for the greater good” and that if “they don’t do it, they are weak and the weak drag everyone else down and therefore must be done away with.”
To wear a mask, in other words, indicates a belief that your personal body can become infected. A fascist-minded person like Trump cannot admit such a thing, either because he genuinely believes he is too strong to be affected by the virus or because he fears looking weak in public. Just as important, wearing a mask indicates care and concern for others, especially those who are high-risk. But the fascist-minded person doesn’t want to protect those viewed as “weak” — in fact, those people are expected to die so as not to be a burden on others. As Strobl points out, the far right believes that by becoming seriously ill or dying in service to some warped conception of the greater good, the “weak” can prove themselves strong through their sacrifice.
Trump hasn’t exactly concealed his impulse to see the coronavirus as a force that culls the herd of its weakest members, or to perceive that the “weak” can be redeemed through this morbid, sadistic ritual sacrifice. This week, he repeatedly insisted that Americans should think of themselves as “warriors” who bravely go forth and face the virus for the cause of, well, his re-election, which he is convinced depends on reopening the economy without bothering with the testing protocols, contact tracing and other precautions that could make doing so both safe and feasible.
(Even if people are willing to die for a noble cause, it’s worth pausing here and observing gently that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is not such a cause.)
Moreover, Trump has always made a point of presenting himself as the fascist version of the Übermensch, even as he is likely too dim to know that word or what it signifies. Trump is forever bragging about his alleged “good genes,” which he often invokes as being so powerful as to render him a genius-level expert in any number of subjects, from medicine to economics to military strategy, without any need to do anything as weak and effeminate as learning stuff. Wearing a mask would go against his effort to present himself as possessing near-supernatural genetic powers to repel the sorts of viruses with which mere mortals must contend.
Of course, Trump doesn’t actually believe his own lies on this subject (nor on many others). As NBC News has reported, when Trump found out that a White House valet had the coronavirus, he became “lava level mad” at his staff and accused them of not doing enough to protect him. His public bravado is, as with all things Trump, a thin mask plastered over a deep well of insecurity. He may want you to believe his immune system is superhuman, but he knows full well that his obese and shattered 73-year-old physique puts him in the category of the high-risk people he and his fellow Republicans are treating as weaklings better off culled from the herd.
Unfortunately, because face masks have become such a potent symbol to far-right culture warriors of values they reject, such as equality and compassion, we can only expect the symbolic clash over masks to escalate. More and more conservatives, especially men, will try to prove their superior masculine strength and power by refusing to wear them. This is childish, selfish and entirely counterproductive, of course. What else can we expect from Trump and his followers, who are the real weaklings in this unhappy social equation?",['ego']
"And sure, Republicans are stupid enough to go out and get infected, doing the virus’ dirty work for it. But the economy isn’t going anywhere as long as most people, who are sane and smart, refuse to put themselves in danger for a movie or haircut.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/sweden-is-testing-conservatives-preferred-coronavirus-response-and-its-not-going-well/,alternet,coronavirus,left,71.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Many conservatives are in love with the idea of Sweden’s approach—no lockdown. They don’t take into consideration that half of Swedes live alone, or that they have a top-notch universal healthcare system. They just think “no lockdown” is a better response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
If nothing else, Sweden’s alternative response to the virus was … a good control group. And what we’re learning now is that failing to shut down hasn’t just led to more deaths, but—surprise surprise!—it also didn’t prevent its economy from tanking. In fact, Sweden is poised for more economic pain than its neighbors.
Sweden is quickly rising up the ranks of the world leaders in deaths. Here is the world ranking of deaths per million residents, excluding micro-nations:
DEATHS PER MILLION BELGIUM 726 SPAIN 558 ITALY 495 UK 451 FRANCE 395 NETHERLANDS 309 SWEDEN 301 IRELAND 284 USA 230
Sweden (like the United States) has been quickly moving up this horrid chart and will overtake the Netherlands sometime this weekend for the sixth spot in the world. Meanwhile, its neighbors following more standard shutdown protocols are looking pretty okay:
DEATHS PER MILLION SWEDEN 301 DENMARK 89 FINLAND 46 NORWAY 40
It’s not even close. So Sweden is starting to wonder whether this all made sense. “[Anders] Tegnell, who has been leading the country’s COVID-19 response and previously defended the nation’s decision not to impose a lockdown, this week admitted he was ‘not convinced’ the unconventional anti-lockdown strategy was the best option to take,” reported Newsweek. Tegnell called the death toll, now surpassing 3,000 dead, a “horrifyingly large number.”
But that sacrifice in blood at least saved the country’s economy, right? Well, that’s the funny part. (And not in a “ha ha” funny way.) “Sweden’s economy is expected to contract between 6.9% and 9.7%,” reported CNBC. Meanwhile, this is what the International Monetary Fund expects from other European countries:
ECONOMIC CONTRACTION SWEDEN 6.9-9.7% ITALY 9.1% SPAIN 8% FRANCE 7.2% UK 7% GERMANY 6.5% DENMARK 6.5% FINALD 6%
In a sane world, this controlled “experiment” would be reason enough for policymakers in the United States to hold back on reopening their states and the country. Instead, those ignoramuses are hell-bent on making the same obvious mistakes, pretending that returning to “business as usual” will rescue the country from economic calamity.
And sure, Republicans are stupid enough to go out and get infected, doing the virus’ dirty work for it. But the economy isn’t going anywhere as long as most people, who are sane and smart, refuse to put themselves in danger for a movie or haircut.
Or, to put it another way: It is impossible for the economy to rebound as long as a deadly virus is killing Americans at a clip of several thousand a day. If you don’t believe that, just look at Sweden.","['stupid', 'sane', 'smart']"

Trump has been desperate for a way to distract the country from the soaring death rate of the coronavirus pandemic (now at 108,000 and counting) and the 40 million left unemployed in the resulting economic collapse. He believed that a racist and sadistic backlash against the protesters was just the ticket.
“Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump tweeted on Saturday, anticipating clashes between protesters and police, who, taking their cues from Trump, have been assaulting peaceful protesters in multiple cities. (If he was hoping his gun-toting supporters from the “heartland” might show up in Washington, they didn’t.)
Trump also tweeted “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” that weekend, echoing a slogan attributed to a notorious Miami police chief in the 1960s.
Trump has kept it up ever since, instructing federal police to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House on Monday evening to clear the area for his ludicrous photo-op holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Square, a stunt that outraged the bishop who oversees that church.
Earlier on Monday, Trump berated state governors in a phone meeting, calling them “weak” for not unleashing more police violence, declaring, “You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you,” and arguing that without violent suppression, the protests will continue.
Now, on the eighth day of these history-shaping protests, Trump’s theory that a violent crackdown will end the protests and cause “real Americans” to rally around him in gratitude has been put to the test. So far, it looks like he couldn’t have been more wrong. Violent crackdowns in many places have only made the protests larger, and polling suggests the public is rejecting Trump’s sadism in large numbers.
When he finally spoke in the Rose Garden on Monday, Trump threatened to deploy the military against American citizens if the governors didn’t take his advice for a more forceful crackdown. This threat didn’t appear to cow anyone, and only increased the anger. More people started joining the protests, despite the ongoing pandemic, and the protests have spread from the cities to many smaller cities and suburbs. Going home at curfew probably would have been a popular choice if Trump had kept his yap shut, but now many protesters are openly defying curfew in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Washington, at least partly to deliver a specific FU to the president.
On the polling front, early numbers suggest that in this battle between protesters, on one hand, and Trump and violent police on the other, the protesters are winning the PR battle. An analysis by Michael Tesler of the Washington Post concludes that “the public views Trump as a racially divisive figure at a time when racial reconciliation is needed.”
Polling from the past few days, according to Tesler’s analysis, shows that only 31% of Americans approved of the looting-and-shooting tweet and only 37% of Americans were willing to say that Trump is not a racist. A majority of Americans — 52% — think Trump is a racist, which, considering how reluctant Americans are to use that word, is a remarkable finding.
Trump’s approval ratings have held stubbornly at around 42%, but these flare-ups that remind people how racist he is —as when he called neo-Nazis “very fine people” in August of 2017 — tend to push it down temporarily to that 37% or so who will never acknowledge any negative evidence about him (probably because they share his views). This suggests that there’s a small but noticeable minority of Trump voters who are made uneasy by his overt racism, and would prefer him to tone it down a little so they can rationalize their support for him.
Trump hasn’t hidden that he feels considerable fondness for the days when Southern police would openly crack skulls, unleash dogs and otherwise violently assault the nonviolent civil rights movement of the ’60s famously led by Martin Luther King Jr. and others, including current Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump regularly waxed nostalgic about that violence, talking about “the good old days” when “they used to treat them very, very rough” and “when they protested once, you know, they would not do it again so easily.” He would whine about how “everybody’s politically correct” these days, and so protesters can’t be “carried out on a stretcher.”
Trump’s invocation of “the good old days” was vague enough that reporters were reluctant to point out the obvious: He was talking about how much he missed watching cops beat up and terrorize civil rights and antiwar protesters during his youth in the ’60s. His behavior these days should remove any plausible deniability.
But while it appears Trump may have fond memories of rooting for the cops against civil rights protesters, no doubt egged on by his father (who was once arrested at a Ku Klux Klan riot in the 1920s), he appears to have forgotten that the cops did not come out on top back then either. On the contrary, the images of shocking violence against peaceful protesters helped build the political will to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the latter of which Trump and his Republican allies have been actively trying to gut (and often succeeding) in recent years.
If Trump is thinking about history at all, he’s focused on the 1968 presidential election, in which Richard Nixon rode a wave of racist backlash against the civil rights movement to victory. He’s not exactly being subtle about his theory, tweeting “SILENT MAJORITY!” , a reference to Nixon’s campaign strategy, on Tuesday.
Overtly comparing himself to one of the most despised presidents in American history is a choice that suggests Trump dramatically overestimating the nostalgia other Americans feel for the viciously reactionary and pro-segregationist politics of the ’60s and ’70s. As multiple historians and historical experts have pointed out — including Todd Gitlin in USA Today, Kevin Kruse in the Washington Post and Jamelle Bouie in the New York Times — Nixon’s victory wasn’t just about harnessing racism. He was also the challenger in 1968, facing an incumbent party that controlled all branches of government and had presided over a decade of military debacle overseas and worsening unrest at home.
“You can’t promise ‘law and order’ when disorder is happening on your watch,” Bouie said, noting that this time around it’s presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden who appears to be reaching voters who yearn for a return to the days of peace and normality.
In addition, political science shows that the number of white voters who thrill to overtly racist appeals is declining. It’s still an unfortunately large proportion, to be clear. But in the 2018 midterms, exit polls showed that despite Trump’s rampant racist demagoguery in the days before the election, the Republican share of the white vote declined from 57% to 54%. That’s a modest change, but in a tight national election, it could make a decisive difference.
Even Republican politicians seem to understand that the writing is on the wall. MSNBC put together a compilation of Republican senators asked for their opinion on Trump tear-gassing protesters so he could have a prettier photo shoot, and the whole thing is an exercise in how fast someone can run away from the camera, while trying not to say anything at all.
Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, an avid Trump enabler in nearly all cases, resorted to a passive non-statement: “Egregious wrongs have been done,” he said. “Much of it recorded.” He did not say had committed the wrongs, or to whom.
No one mistakes Trump’s chest-thumping about “law and order” as a legitimate call for either. After all, Trump is a shameless criminal himself who thrives on division and chaos. For people who like his racism, that’s just fine. But most Americans are disgusted by his racism, and a small but interesting subset of white folks don’t much care about the racism, but would prefer it were kept on the down-low. Both groups appear to be angry with Trump, or at least annoyed, for stoking the fires and calling for more police violence.
None of this is cause for complacency. Trump is still in a shockingly strong position to win re-election, due to voter suppression and the Electoral College that gives disproportionate power to his supporters, especially his most devoted fans in sparsely populated and more rural states. He won in 2016 even though Hillary Clinton got substantially more votes, and that could clearly happen again.
That said, Trump’s margins were paper-thin in crucial swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and depended heavily on that margin of voters who are uncomfortable with his racism but somehow convinced themselves he was preferable to the alternative. The harder Trump makes it for those people to bury their head in the sand, the harder it will be for them to suck it up and vote for him again. His recent antics could make that very difficult indeed. He thought he could “dominate” the protesters, but at least for the moment they have the upper hand.","['ludicrous', 'stunt']"

“America is under attack. America is under attack from homegrown white nationalist terrorism,” Buttigieg told AFSCME Public Service forum in Las Vegas on Saturday. “And we have to talk and act about two things in this country: First of all, we are the only country in the world with more guns than people. It has not made us safer. We can respect the Second Amendment and not allow it to be a death sentence for thousands of Americans. And two, white nationalism is evil. And it is inspiring to commit murder and it is being condoned at the highest levels of the American government, and that has to end.”

Buttigieg also pointed some of the blame at Trump, arguing that “the President of the United States is condoning white nationalism. White nationalism is one of the evils that is motivating and inspiring at least some to go kill Americans” and saying that Trump has a “responsibility to nip that in the bud.

Buttigieg elaborated on these thoughts during an interview with Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.”
“This is terrorism and we have to name it as such,” Buttigieg told Wallace. “It is very clear that the loss of American life in Charleston, in San Diego, in Pittsburgh, by all appearances now in El Paso too, is symptomatic of the effects of white nationalist terrorism. We cannot keep America safe from this threat to the American people if we’re not prepared to name it and confront it. We need an administration that is ready to do that and we can’t keep pretending that this is just random or that this is something we can’t confront.”
He added, “What you have here is two things coming together: One, the weak gun safety policies of this country, and two, the rise of domestic terrorism inspired by white nationalists.”
Buttigieg expressed similar thoughts to CNN anchor Jake Tapper on Sunday.

“Every time this happens, we say ‘Never again.’ We say we’re going to do something,” Buttigieg told Tapper. “We say it’s going to change. And it hasn’t. I’ve been thinking a lot about the fact that this same debate, and this same cycle, has been going on my entire adult life. And I’m wondering what it will take to get this sense of urgency, to get Washington to actually respond, especially when Americans frankly in both parties want to see changes. At least some basic common sense measures on gun safety, not to mention the need to stand up to white nationalist terrorism.”
At least 20 people died and 26 others were wounded by the shooting in El Paso, which authorities suspect was perpetrated by a racist with a hatred of Latinx immigrants. Less than 24 hours after that shooting, another one took place in Dayton, Ohio, one that took nine lives (the motive of the shooter is currently unknown).",[]

The Treasury Department’s inspector general is looking into the opportunity zone program following stories by ProPublica and The New York Times about how the tax break meant to help the poor had been manipulated by billionaires.
The development, which was first reported by NBC News, comes after three congressional Democrats wrote to Treasury’s inspector general in October asking for the probe and citing the ProPublica and Times stories.
“We are conducting an inquiry, and expect to complete our work and respond to the Congressional requesters in early spring,” Deputy Inspector General Richard Delmar said in a statement.
The opportunity zone program, passed as part of the 2017 Trump tax overhaul, offers tax breaks to investors who put money into specially designated areas. While it was pitched as a way to help struggling neighborhoods, ProPublica and others have documented how the process has appeared to benefit billionaires with investments in areas that should not have qualified. In other cases, governors have granted the tax break to their political donors and, in some cases, themselves or their families.
Sen. Cory Booker, an architect of the program, along with Reps. Emanuel Cleaver and Ron Kind, asked the inspector general to do a “complete review” of areas picked for the opportunity zone tax break to see if they were truly eligible. The October letter also asked the inspector general to collect all correspondence between Treasury, White House officials and outside interests about the process.
The inspector general said that once the inquiry is complete it plans to publicly post its response to the congressional Democrats.

"Trump supporters obviously don’t want to admit this. If you turn on Fox News, read Breitbart and The Daily Wire or browse through the cesspools of YouTube or Reddit, you’ll find plenty of people who spin or defend Trump’s bungling.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/the-science-is-clear-trumps-handling-of-the-pandemic-was-disastrous/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,73.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Let us pretend, for the sake of argument, that all of the other terrible things that Donald Trump has done during his presidency never happened: the persecution of immigrants and handouts to the wealthy, the destruction of our environment, his attacks on free speech rights and endless scandals. Even if one could look the other way on all of that and more, the unavoidable reality remains that Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic — completely on its own and without regard to any other policy issue — has been serious enough to justify deeming his administration to be an abject, unforgivable failure.
Trump supporters obviously don’t want to admit this. If you turn on Fox News, read Breitbart and The Daily Wire or browse through the cesspools of YouTube or Reddit, you’ll find plenty of people who spin or defend Trump’s bungling. Yet to quote John Adams (a president far superior to Trump in every way), “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.”
The most recent piece of evidence is a study conducted by a research team led by the University of Arizona evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey. By analyzing existing genomic data from the coronavirus, the scientists concluded that “the virus associated with the first known transmission network in the US did not enter the country until mid-February.” They call the finding “sobering,” noting that “it demonstrates that the window of opportunity to block sustained transmission of the virus stretched all the way until that point.”
In other words, although the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States was reported in Washington state on January 20, “rapid interventions successfully prevented onward transmission” in that individual’s case. Patient zero in the United States most likely entered the country at some point around mid-February, meaning that if Trump had paid attention to the warning signs at that time — of which, as we soon shall see, there were many — he could have implemented measures that saved thousands of lives when the virus inevitably broke out here.
He did not do so, and as a result the number of pandemic-related deaths in this country is likely to soon match that of American fatalities during World War I.
Trump had abundant opportunities to prepare us for a pandemic before the coronavirus reached our shores. Previously, President George W. Bush had the foresight to warn us about a possible pandemic, and to try to prepare for it, back in 2005. Trump did not take any of these concerns seriously. During the first year of Trump’s presidency he ordered the Department of Homeland Security to stop the pandemic modeling that it had done in conjunction with national laboratories since 2005, and proposed a 20 percent budget cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2018 he proposed $900 million in budget cuts to the CDC, removed a member of his national security team who had advocated a complete biodefense plan in the event of a pandemic, and disbanded the global health national security team. By 2019 he was allowing 2,109 ventilators (equalling 21 percent of the Strategic National Stockpile’s inventory) to become unusable, eliminating a U.S. Agency for International Development program that existed to warn America about possible public health threats and ignoring a warning from the Council of Economic Advisors that a pandemic could kill up to half a million Americans.
Then 2020 arrived. Trump reportedly was initially warned about the coronavirus outbreak by intelligence officers on January 3. His first substantial briefing on the coronavirus occurred 15 days later, with Secretary of Health and Human Services Alexander Azar describing Trump as distracted by a desire to crack down on vaping and characterizing concerns about the pandemic as “alarmist.” After the first confirmed case was made public, Trump told a televised audience that “we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” On that same day he refused to implement policy recommendations in a “pandemic playbook” developed by President Barack Obama’s administration that would have protected the American workforce.
Trump proceeded to ignore multiple other attempts made over subsequent weeks by his advisers and Republican allies to get him to take the pandemic seriously. Instead he dismissed their warnings as “alarmist” and would go on to hold a number of rallies (seven) and golfing outings (three) between learning of Obama’s pandemic playbook and ultimately declaring a national emergency. To make it clear that he was not concerned about the pandemic during this period, Trump’s budget proposal — which was released on February 10 — called for “cutting Health and Human Services funding by $9.5 billion, including a 15 percent cut of $1.2 billion to the CDC and a $35 million decrease to the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund’s annual contribution.” On February 14 he ignored a memo jointly written by Health and Human Services and the National Security Council that called for “significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone.” It also called for school closures, stay-at-home orders and advocating nearly universal telework.
Less than a week later Trump allowed 14 Americans infected with the coronavirus on a cruise ship to return to the United States despite CDC warnings not to do so. When Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned Americans to prepare for a possible outbreak, Trump was so angered by the subsequent stock market crash that he cancelled a planned coronavirus task force briefing. Instead he continued reassuring the public, claiming on February 26 that the cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,” insisting on March 2 that “we’re talking about a much smaller range” of deaths than the flu and saying on March 6 that the pandemic was an “unforeseen problem” that “came out of nowhere.” On March 10 a Trump official said the administration continued to stand by its proposed budget cuts to the CDC, while on the same day Trump himself praised the “great job” his administration was doing in handling the crisis and reassured Americans “it will go away” and “it’s really working out.”
Three days later, he declared a national emergency — more than 10 weeks after he was first informed of the situation.
Since that time Trump has passed on pseudoscientific claims about hydroxychloroquine, a drug he touts as a treatment (and in which he has a financial stake — he has a small personal interest in Sanofi, a French company that makes the drug’s brand-name version). He has wrongly passed the buck of blame to the Obama administration by lying about their policies and his own. He has made a number of premature attempts to reopen the economy; notably, he said the country would be “raring to go by Easter”, then expressed solidarity with protesters opposing their state’s stay-at-home orders by tweeting that their governments should “liberate” them. Soon after, he threatened to override governors who kept houses of worship closed (which he lacks the authority to do). Trump mocked his Democratic opponent in the presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden, for wearing a face mask while refusing to don one himself. He has suggested that people inject themselves with disinfectant (later insisting he was joking) and threatened to hold up funding as punishment to states that try to expand access to mail-in voting, which some experts believe will hurt Trump’s reelection chances. He hasn’t done nearly enough to manufacture tests, protect workers or make sure that contact tracing prevents further spread of the disease.
The bottom line is that Trump failed to prepare America for the pandemic for more than two months after he was made aware of it. After he finally declared a national emergency, he refused to offer more than erratic and incompetent leadership. And it is not just observation — scientists and research like the aforementioned study seem clear on this point.
“He should have been warning us it was coming,” Dr. William Haseltine, a biologist, told Salon in March. “He should have been preparing by stockpiling all the necessary equipment. But even today we’re not doing what we should do. Let me put it that way. What we should be doing is contact tracing [identifying people who may have come in contact with infected patients] and having mandatory quarantines for everybody who’s been exposed. And quarantining not at home, but in hotel rooms, single occupancy hotel rooms.”
By failing to understand the science or listen to scientists, Trump has also cost millions of Americans their livelihoods. As the Center for American Progress points out, countries that implemented adequate worker protections and early testing only saw modest increases in unemployment: South Korea from 3.3 percent in February to 3.8 percent in April, Australia from 5.1 percent in February to 6.2 percent in April, Germany from 5 percent in February to 5.8 percent in April. America, by contrast, saw its unemployment rate skyrocket from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, meaning that roughly 17 to 18 million more Americans would have their jobs right now if America’s unemployment rate had only increased on par with those of more competent countries. Incidentally, while more than 107,000 Americans have died so far and more than 1.8 million are confirmed to have been infected, under 12,000 people have been infected in South Korea (273 deaths), less than 190,000 have been infected in Germany (8,602 deaths) and less than 8,000 have been infected in Australia (102 deaths). For the United States, that equals 32.45 out of every 100,000 people, compared to 10.33 out of 100,000 in Germany, 0.41 out of 100,000 in Australia and 0.53 out of 100,000 in South Korea.
If you don’t care about the millions of people who have lost their jobs and the hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives because of Trump’s incompetence, that is your right. If you decide to vote for Trump because there are things he has done as president which you support, or because you feel Biden would be much worse, that is also your right. If you think expert political scientists like Allan Lichtman are wrong when they point out that this crisis makes it more likely than not that Trump will lose in November, that is your right as well. Everyone is entitled to their opinion on whether they think Trump deserves a second term as president or will win one.
No one, however, is entitled to deny scientific evidence. And the facts and evidence make it clear that, scientifically speaking, America’s pandemic crisis is Trump’s fault.","['bungling', 'cesspools', 'obviously']"

But when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on CNN to defend the strike, asserting that Suleimani posed an imminent threat, he struggled to respond to some of John Berman’s questions.
“[Was there a] specific target overseas?” asked Berman.
“I’m not going to say anything more about the nature of the attack, but know this was not just in Iraq,” said Pompeo. “It was using the proxy forces he has manipulated for so long to bring so much destruction to the Shias, Sunnis and Muslims throughout the region. He inflicted harm not only on American lives but created terrible activities supporting Hezbollah, Hamas. Qasem Suleimani was at the center of all of it.”
“Any imminent threat to the U.S. homeland?” Berman pressed him.
“These were threats that were located in the region,” said Pompeo.
“When I ask about the timing, the reason I’m asking is because General Suleimani, as you well know, has been an enormous threat to the United States and U.S. interests for decades.”
“We’ve heard from Iraqi leaders so far condemning the U.S. action,” said Berman. “We heard from a French official this morning putting out a statement saying that the world is less safe following the killing of General Suleimani. And the concern there, no one is saying General Suleimani was a good actor. He was a bad actor. What they’re suggesting is the destabilization will create a threatening environment. When you hear from France, the world is a less safe place this morning, how do you respond to that?”
“Yeah, well, the French are just wrong about that,” said Pompeo. “The world is a much safer place today. And I can assure you Americans in the region are much safer today after the demise of Qasem Suleimani … the Iranian people know that America is a force for the good in the region.”

"Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/bunker-boy-trump-thinks-he-can-edit-reality-like-tv-show/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,73.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Whatever the specifics of what Donald Trump’s diagnosis may be, from the moment protesters started to hit the streets to denounce police brutality, one thing was certain: The president’s brainworms would direct his energies away from doing anything useful and toward the task of managing his ego, relying on the reality TV tricks he mistakes for the real work of presidenting.
And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['hostage', 'terrifying', 'like', 'a']"
"The fact that many Democratic women are no longer convinced that a woman can beat Trump, and are supporting white men for reasons of electability, is a tragedy. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/of-course-a-woman-can-beat-trump/,alternet,gender,left,73.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Polling for the Democratic nomination tells a depressing story for those seeking to break the glass ceiling and make the ultimate stand against patriarchy: the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are currently all white men. Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg lead in almost every poll; the closest female contenders, Warren and Harris, are stalled in single digits often tied with Beto O’Rourke. Which means that nationally known and highly qualified women Senators are tied with a failed Senate candidate and trailing the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, just a few short years after the party nominated its first female candidate for president and four years after the first Afircan-American president left office.
Part of the problem is that many Democratic women are no longer convinced that a woman can beat Trump, and are supporting white men for reasons of electability:
Across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, three of the first states to hold 2020 nominating contests, dozens of women told The Associated Press that they are worried about whether the country is ready to elect a woman as president. Their concerns are political and personal, rooted as much in fear of repeating Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss to Trump as in their own experiences with sexism and gender discrimination… Helen Holden Slottje, a 52-year-old New Hampshire attorney, noted the irony in women raising concerns about nominating a woman. “I fear for that with women, that it’s, ‘Well, we had our chance. We had Hillary. Hillary didn’t pan out. Best to just pick another 65-year-old plus white guy who has the best chance of winning,’” Slottje said.
This is a tragedy, and it’s simply not true. In most head-to-head polling, Senators Warren and Harris would both easily defeat Trump. There were many reasons that Trump defeated Clinton in 2016, and sexism was surely among them. But sexism wasn’t the sole determining factor. Racism played a big part. There was historic cheating and interference from Russia, Comey and much else. Democrats failed to accurately gauge the more populist mood of much of the country, and their views of the real economy beyond the traditional indicators. And Clinton’s campaign simply made a number of profound strategic mistakes.
But in the narrative that followed the 2016 campaign, much of the media and messaging targeted at Democrats repeated that Clinton had done essentially nothing wrong, that Democrats had run the best possible campaign under the circumstances, and that the blame for what happened in 2016 lay not with errors of judgment by the campaigns and those responsible for messaging and tactics at the highest levels of the party, but with the voters themselves. Much of this defense was erected in order to combat recriminations and complaints from the surging Sanders wing of the party–many of which have admittedly ill-founded.
But as I’ve warned in the past, the insistence that nothing could have been done to persuade many of those who voted for Trump without throwing disadvantaged communities under the bus is not only wrong, but carries a heavy price. If you believe that no amount of economic populism or strategic difference could have made a difference in keeping Trump out of the Oval Office, then the necessary and inevitable conclusion is that the public is simply too racist and sexist to elect a woman or person of color against an explicitly racist candidate like Trump. And then predictably, voters most concerned about driving Trump out of office will wind up supporting a white man for misguided strategic reasons.
And that is tragic. A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office.
Kamala Harris would easily be able to dispatch Trump. So would Elizabeth Warren. The polling already shows that, and much the public still has yet to get to know them better. Harris is still largely an unknown, and most voters who know Warren are most familiar not with her strengths but with her weaknesses. More exposure would help them both.
But if Democrats want to avoid setting up yet another older white man as their nominee, they have to be willing to acknowledge that things could have been done differently in 2016 to avoid defeat. Otherwise, the Democratic base is going to draw regrettable conclusions about the state of the electorate and act accordingly.",['tragedy']
"The white supremacists and other far right extremists are super-gun-owners, they are armed to the teeth, and law enforcement is understandably reluctant to get them het up.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/here-are-the-top-6-reasons-why-police-are-cracking-down-on-black-protesters-while-treating-white-reopeners-with-kid-gloves/,alternet,gun-control,left,74.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"My social media feeds have been full of comparisons between the treatment by police of Reopener mobs, some of whom invaded the Michigan state house while fully armed with assault weapons, and the treatment of protesters in Minneapolis regarding the killing of George Floyd by a policemen who kept his knee on his neck.
Why does the Far Right all too often get a pass by American law enforcement?
1. The white supremacists and other far right elements are armed to the teeth. There are about 255 million guns in the US, but something like 75 percent of Americans say they don’t own a gun. So between 22% and 31% of Americans, about 80 to 100 million people, own all the guns. Then 3 percent of the population, some 10 million people, own 100 million guns.
Let me underline that. About 40 percent of all guns in the United States are owned by about 10 million people, some 3 percent of the population. So owning guns is legal, and I’m from a family of farmers who hunted with them, and I’m not knocking gun ownership. And I’m sure there are perfectly innocent hobbyists who collect guns the way other people collect vintage automobiles. But a tiny percentage within that percentage of super-gun-owners are far right wing extremists, and law enforcement is understandably reluctant to get them het up.
2. White supremacists are very good about playing passive aggressive games and nursing and sharing grievances. In the 1990s, Federal agencies like the FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms were called in to deal with heavily armed white terrorists. A 1992 stand off at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, between gun nut Randy Weaver (whose family was with him) ended in tragedy when FBI snipers took out Weaver and his wife. Weaver had refused to show up for his trial on weapons charges (he had sawed off a shotgun, which is illegal in Idaho).
Then the following year the David Koresh splinter of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, was investigated for stockpiling weapons, and a raid left 4 ATF agents and 6 Branch Davidians dead, with many agents wounded. That firefight led to an FBI siege of the compound and ultimately to the deaths of 76 members, including Koresh, in fires that they may have set themselves.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, both on the fringe of white supremacy and conspiracy theories, cited Ruby Ridge and Waco when they blew up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklohama City in 1995 with a fertilizer bomb (and ended up targeting the day care center on the first floor). They killed 168 people and wounded hundreds more. They killed more persons per capita than any other terrorists in American history up to that point.
It isn’t usually said out loud, but the Oklahoma City bombing was the most successful act of terrorism in American history. It led the FBI and other Federal agencies, as well as local law enforcement in many instances, to back off the white supremacists, neo-Nazis and kindred groups, leaving them be unless they did something really egregious. Terrorism is was defined at the time in the US Federal code as the use of violence by a non-state actor against civilians to change politics. So that worked.
3. This is one of the reasons for which the Obama administration did not take the bait when Cliven Bundy, whom I compared to the Taliban, staged a standoff over his refusal to pay fees for grazing on Federal land. People like Bundy were looking for further ammunition to grow their “sovereign citizen” movement, and a violent crackdown would have helped them.
4. White supremacists, militia movement members, and other fringe groups of the far right may make up 10 percent of the US population. The form a key if unspoken part of the Republican Party and provide the margin for Republicans in many tight congressional races. This is why Sarah Palin and other GOP leaders engage in codespeak, talking about the “patriots,” which sounds inoffensive until you realize about whom exactly she was speaking. In the zeroes of this century, Republicans in Congress actually stopped Federal agencies from keeping tabs and good statistics on far right extremism, lest one of their constituencies be upset. Trump is the first major national Republican leader openly to cultivate the far right constituency, but he has plenty of predecessors who did it more gingerly.
5. Likewise, Trump and his Neo-Nazi black shirts are looking for trouble so as to depict the normal people as tyrants and enlist more discontents. This is white Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer merely complained about the mob that came for her having confederate flags and assault weapons, but did not order them dealt with by law enforcement. The Michigan state legislature actually just shut down to accommodate these white terrorists. But if any of them had been shot by police, you know that it would just have brought more gangs to Lansing and that Trump would have been whipping up the fringe into a lather. Whitmer handled the situation wisely, even at the cost of ceding ground to far right wing thugs on the right of democratically elected legislators to meet in the state house.
The point isn’t that Whitmer and others are wrong. They are doing the right thing. The point is that African-Americans with grievances should also be cut some slack.
6. African-Americans are made to look big and menacing by the white media and many political figures, but they are a minority. They are only 12 percent of the population. If you had a gathering of 100 representative Americans, only 12 of them would be of African heritage. They are systematically discriminated against on employment, which keeps them poor. They have only 10 cents for every dollar a white person has. As a disadvantaged minority they are still, despite the supposed end to Jim Crow, subjected to enormous amounts of surveillance and are incarcerated at a rate many times more than whites.
It is systematic racism that allows the authorities to treat African-Americans like pariahs and to crack down hard on them if they protest. In 1985 the city of Philadelphia actually bombed the facilities of the Black nationalist MOVE organization. At Ferguson, Mo. in 2014, the shooting of a black youth led the Justice Department to uncover a racket on the part of the town’s white elite that used police fines and jailings systematically to extract wealth from the African-Americans.
In fact, it is this systematic racism (which is very different from the occasional piece of prejudice that most whites imagine to be the problem), that has led African-Americans to suffer disproportionately from the coronavirus.
In order to redress the injustices here, it isn’t enough to raise a hue and cry about individual instances of racism. The establishment, of systematic racism, in everything from school resegregation to residential segregation to employment discrimination, needs to be addressed through a second generation of civil rights legislation. 1964 and 1965 did not go nearly far enough.","['super-gun-owners', 'understandably']"

And for most of the network’s existence, Hillary Clinton has served as a perennial rogue, depicted as a villainous, criminal scoundrel who can’t be trusted with America’s future. With Clinton now receding from public life, Fox News has seamlessly transferred its vile attacks onto a new generation of Democratic women, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
“Fox News needs an opponent, a detractor, an enemy to add conflict and edge to its broadcasts,” noted the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple. In other words, Fox is in the business of scripted entertainment—under the guise of “news”—and needs long-running characters that it can return to again and again. It crafts targets of hate who rile up viewers and keep them tuned in to the different storylines.
For Fox, Clinton, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez represent perfect targets in terms of riling up its intolerant base: Clinton is a woman of a certain age, while Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are women of a certain heritage. And yes, there’s something in the Fox News DNA over the years that has meant that women political opponents spark a deeper sense of outrage and hate. You could make an argument that during eight years in the White House, it was Michelle Obama who suffered sharper, more personal Fox News attacks than did her husband. It’s all part of an endless, dehumanizing campaign to silence opponents, and specifically to silence and intimidate Democratic women.
This week, Fox News’ sister print outlet, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, published an incitement on the front page, which depicted the World Trade Towers bursting into flames and falsely claimed that Omar, who is Muslim, had belittled the Sept. 11 attack. The reckless pile-on has been relentless. Days earlier, Fox & Friendshost Brian Kilmeade questioned Omar’s loyalty, saying, “You have to wonder if she is an American first.” Over at Fox Business News, Lou Dobbs claimed, “She sounds like she hates America.” Those comments echoed those made by another Fox host, Jeanine Pirro, who suggested, “Omar wears a hijab. … Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?”
Pirro was actually suspended from hosting her Saturday night show for two weeks because of her tawdry attack on Omar. But her suspension has obviously done nothing to curtail the mindless, racist attacks on the Democratic congresswoman. All this has happened while threats against Omar’s life continue to escalate.
To date, Fox News’ obsession with Ocasio-Cortez, for the most part, hasn’t been as overtly dangerous as its smear campaign against Omar, but the negative attention has been unending.","['dehumanizing', 'silence', 'intimidate']"
Pompeo confronts simple questions he just can't seem to answer.,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/pompeo-confronts-simple-questions-he-just-can-t-seem-answer-n1123696,msnbc,white-nationalism,left,74.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sat down today with NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, who asked whether he owes former U.S. Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch an apology. Given the latest revelations, and the way in which Pompeo's State Department forced Yovanovitch from her post under scandalous circumstances, the question was more than fair.
The nation's chief diplomat didn't seem to agree, however. He complained about the line of inquiry and complained about the Obama administration for a while, before the host narrowed the focus, asking about the State Department personnel who've resigned because of Pompeo's refusal to stand up for American diplomats. He balked, attributing the concerns to ""unnamed sources.""
Kelly wasted little time in reminding the Kansas Republican that the sources aren't unnamed at all: his own State Department senior adviser, Michael McKinley, a career Foreign Service officer with four decades experience, testified under oath about the department's failures in this area.

Pompeo said he wouldn't comment on McKinley's assessment, either, though he insisted that he's ""defended every State Department official"" since taking the reins at the cabinet agency. The NPR host, likely realizing that this claim wasn't true, pressed further on this specific point:
KELLY: Respectfully, where have you defended Marie Yovanovich? POMPEO: I've defended every single person on this team I've done what's right for every person on this team. KELLY: Can you point me towards your remarks? POMPEO: I've said all I'm going to say.
On the one hand, I'm glad to see Pompeo sit down for interviews with outlets outside the conservative media bubble. On the other hand, when the secretary of State does sit down for these interviews, they don't seem to go well.
Pompeo appeared hopelessly lost when WSMV’s Nancy Amon was far better prepared for an interview than he was. Soon after, the cabinet secretary’s interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos was every bit as cringe-worthy. Reflecting on Pompeo’s on-air comments, MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace told viewers, “That was the worst appearance by an executive branch official I’ve ever seen in my career.”
Soon after, the secretary sat down with KMUV in Wichita and threw a minor tantrum when asked to defend State Department employees against Donald Trump's attacks.
Pompeo also spoke with the Wichita Eagle in November, and that interview turned messy, too: when asked about the impact on U.S. credibility when the White House fails to honor its partnership with the Kurds, the secretary replied, ""The whole predicate of your question is insane."" (It was actually quite sane.)
As we discussed at the time, if Pompeo can’t handle some of these basic questions, why does he keep agreeing to interviews?

The white nationalist who said “Hail Trump” and “hail our people” during a conference in Washington D.C. on Saturday — and who received straight-armed Nazi-like salutes in response — told NBC News Monday that his comments were meant to be “cheeky,” “exuberant” and “ironic.”
The remarks from Richard Spencer, whose National Policy Institute was described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as one of the most influential purveyors of academic racism in the country, were published in a video by the Atlantic on Monday.

Spencer, 38, told NBC News that the conference was the “next step” for the “alt-right,” a soft euphemism for the once-fringe network with ties to white nationalism that vaulted into the mainstream political scene with Donald Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and includes everyone from hardcore white supremacists and neo-Nazis to critics of so-called ""political correctness.""

Analysis: Breitbart's Steve Bannon Leads the 'Alt Right' to the White House
""We need to take this next step in terms of professionalization and in terms of being able to influence people,"" he told NBC News, adding that he is ""very willing to criticize"" Trump and say ""things that he’s not willing or able to say.""

In a statement, the Trump transition team said that the president-elect ""has continued to denounce racism of any kind and he was elected because he will be a leader for every American. To think otherwise is a complete misrepresentation of the movement that united Americans from all backgrounds.""
In the video, Spencer appeared to raise a glass after saying, ""Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory.""
In response, some in the crowd, which had gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building and which the Atlantic estimated to be 200, saluted.

“There’s an ironic exuberance to it all,” Spencer claimed. ""I think that’s ... one of the things that makes the alt-right fun, is that we’re willing to do things that are a bit cheeky.”
At other points in his speech, Spencer used a term employed by the Nazis to attack the media — ""Lügenpresse,"" German for lying press — to describe the mainstream media.
""It’s not just that many are genuinely stupid,"" he said of reporters. ""Indeed, one wonders if these people are people at all.""
One tactic of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime was to declare enemies inhuman.
Spencer speculated that the media may be ""soulless golem,"" a reference to magically animated beings from Jewish folklore.
At another point, Spencer said that to be ""white is to be a striver, an explorer and a conqueror ... We don’t gain anything from [other racial groups'] presence. They need us and not the other way around.""",['Nazi-like']
"Even the European Union (with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993) has adopted the radical economic and political ideologies of Thatcherism and Reaganism—neoliberalism—that benefitted wealthy elites while forcing austerity on its poorer member nations, inflicting massive pain and inciting right-wing movements in Greece, Spain and Italy, among others.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/10/ronald-reagan-launched-an-attack-on-the-middle-class-we-must-reverse-it-to-save-our-democracy/,alternet,middle-class,left,74.0,1.0,Biased,No agreement,"The destruction of the middle class is destroying democracies and paving the way for authoritarian rule.
In 2016, Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk published a paper in the Journal of Democracy showing how, in the era since Reagan led America out of classical economic policy and into neoliberalism (aka “trickle-down” and “supply-side” economics), many Americans have ceased to value democracy.
“In the United States,” they write, “among all age cohorts, the share of citizens who believe that it would be better to have a ‘strong leader’ who does not have to ‘bother with parliament and elections’ has also risen over time: In 1995, 24 percent of respondents held this view; by 2011, that figure had increased to 32 percent.” By the time the paper came out in 2016, fully 49 percent of Americans thought elites should make decisions, rather than “government.”
And the growing disillusionment with democracy as a way to protect the interests of average voters doesn’t just push them toward solutions hatched by the Heritage Foundation or the Cato Institute; increasingly, Americans would even consider a military junta ruling America, something that would shock the founders.
“In the past three decades,” Foa and Mounk write, “the share of U.S. citizens who think that it would be a ‘good’ or ‘very good’ thing for the ‘army to rule’—a patently undemocratic stance—has steadily risen. In 1995, just one in sixteen respondents agreed with that position; today, one in six agree.”
And it’s not just in the United States; democracies across the world are falling to the power of right-wing strongman leaders. Just in the past few decades we’ve seen this happen in Hungary, Poland, the Philippines, India, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia and, most recently, Brazil. Arguably, it has happened here in the United States with the Electoral College’s selection of Donald Trump as president. Meanwhile, hard-right groups seeking such autocracy are rising fast across Europe, particularly in France, Italy, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In a recent article for the Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria notes this trend, along with Foa and Mounk’s research, and tries to analyze its cause.
“Why is this?” Zakaria writes. “The best I can guess is that we are living in times of great change — economic, technological, demographic, cultural — and in this swirl, people feel insecure and anxious.”
But America and the world have been in the midst of “great change” many times before, including during and after two world wars, but this trend toward authoritarianism has been happening uniquely since the 1980s.
That decade saw the adoption of the radical economic and political ideologies of Thatcherism and Reaganism—neoliberalism—which have since swept the world’s democracies. Even the European Union (with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993) has adopted neoliberal “reforms” that benefitted wealthy elites while forcing austerity on its poorer member nations, inflicting massive pain and inciting right-wing movements in Greece, Spain and Italy, among others.
In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher led the way in 1978. She rejected government ownership of parts of the commons like railways, busted unions, and later argued that, “There is no such thing as society… [only] individual men and women, and… families.”
Reagan came to power in 1980 with the help of vast amounts of money from corporations and the morbidly rich, made possible by the twin 1976 and 1978 Supreme Court decisions of Buckley v. Valeo and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, which said that billionaires and corporations owning politicians was “free speech.”
With a nod to his oligarch funders, in his inaugural address, his first day on the job as president, Reagan famously said, “[G]overnment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”
When Reagan flipped our economic system on its head, rejecting two generations of classical Adam Smith economics and replacing it with the Laffer Curve and “supply-side” economics, almost a third of Americans had union jobs and around 60 percent of American families lived in the economic “middle class.” But starting in 2015, as NPR noted, reporting on a Pew study, “middle-income households have become the minority.”
Since David Koch’s failed 1980 run for VP on the Libertarian ticket, American oligarchs have invested billions of dollars in the message that government is bad and can’t be trusted. The most obvious example was the faux-grassroots Tea Party “movement” funded by Koch front groups, causing thousands of Americans to protest “government-run” health care with slogans like, “Keep your goddamn government hands off my Medicare!”
Koch and his oligarch friends suggested, through their surrogates and think tanks, that instead of a functioning democracy we should have a government both owned and run by them and their billionaire buddies.
And that’s largely what we have now, with the Trump administration. As former Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently tweeted, “A corporate lawyer runs DOL, a pharma exec runs HHS, a coal lobbyist runs EPA, an oil lobbyist runs DOI, a Raytheon lobbyist runs DOD, a steel lobbyist is the US trade rep, and a banking exec runs USDT.” I’d add that a former Verizon lawyer runs the FCC, and midlevel positions across the federal government are now filled with lobbyists and lawyers from industry.
Prior to the Reagan Revolution, Americans usually got what they wanted from the government.
The successes of LBJ’s Great Society programs during the 1960s are a great example: Medicare, Medicaid, Voting Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, cutting poverty in half, Head Start, the National Teacher Corps, hundreds of billions in student college aid, PBS and NPR, Air Quality Act, Water Quality Act, Wilderness Act, National Trails System Act, creating the Cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Action Agencies, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Child Safety Act, mandating warning labels on cigarettes, the Immigration Act that ended race-based immigration quotas, food stamps, and massive investments in public schools and hospitals… among other things.
In the 1970s, Jimmy Carter followed up by creating the Department of Energy and passing energy programs that would have moved 20 percent of America’s electricity generation to solar by 2000 (it was ended by Reagan), establishing the Department of Education, massively expanding Head Start, passing major laws to regulate coal mining and make it safer, forcing polluters to clean up superfund sites, and doubling our public lands in Alaska. Not to mention winning the Nobel Prize for working out a peace deal between Egypt and Israel that holds to this day.
Before the 1980s, Western Europe and other democracies saw similar expansions of people-based government programs. But nearly all of it came to a screeching halt—and much was even reversed—with the neoliberal Thatcher and Reagan Revolutions.
Today’s standard-bearers for neoliberalism are the Republicans (and a few corporate-owned Democrats), and, as Americans figure out that the probability today of legislation passing that’s supported by the majority of Americans is today equivalent to random chance, they’re revolting.
And the oligarch billionaires have been waiting for just this moment, funding massive voter suppression, right-wing media, politicians who tell us that up is down, and efforts to keep their colleague, billionaire Donald Trump, in office. While the outreach to “very fine people” in the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements is a bit less visible, it’s there, too.
So long as the governments of America and other countries are captives of oligarchs and big corporations, and hang onto anti-worker, anti-middle-class neoliberal policies, citizens will continue to drift toward hard-right “populist” politicians.
Democracies will only begin to revive when we reverse the Reagan Revolution and return to the classical economic and political systems that existed in the Western world before the neoliberal 1980s.
And if that reversal doesn’t happen soon, the trend toward autocratic oligarchy will continue to speed up. As Foa and Mounk note in the conclusion of their research paper, “[W]hat was once unthinkable should no longer be considered outside the realm of possibility.”

"For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/worse-than-a-preschooler-donald-trump-is-failing-the-marshmallow-test/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,74.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"Fifty years ago, in a now-classic experiment, Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel and his colleagues presented preschoolers with a plate of treats and a dilemma: They could have one marshmallow now or wait 20 minutes and get two marshmallows later.
The kids who managed to wait (despite a plateful of temptation in front of them) turned out to be generally more successful than their more impatient peers. Their grades were better, their SAT scores were higher, they were healthier and socially better-adjusted. The experiment set off an explosion of scholarship on the benefits of delayed gratification, perseverance, and “grit.” It’s one reason “self-mastery” and “self-control” are part of almost every kindergartener’s curriculum today.
America is now facing something like a national Marshmallow Test. Many states are pushing to reopen their economies, even with plentiful evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. As summer beckons and restrictions loosen, citizens will have to judge just how far they’ll reach for a taste of pre-pandemic normalcy, whether it’s a trip to the salon, a carefree cookout with friends, or a night out at the theater. More challenging, people will have to maintain the discipline of social distancing until the virus is genuinely under control. It might be tantalizing to forego some of the summer’s most sought-after activities—like a trip to the beach—but the most abstemious countries will have greater rewards down the line. No doubt, those that persevere in taming the virus will claim the prize of lasting economic stability.
President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. Worse than the preschooler who succumbs to a single marshmallow, Trump would stuff his face and then smash the plate.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. Barely two weeks after declaring a national emergency in mid-March, he said he hoped to see “packed churches” by Easter and started urging the return of professional sports with full stadiums. As cases mounted a month later, Trump tweeted to “liberate” three states from lockdown restrictions, encouraging rebellions against governors’ efforts to stop the spread of infection. Then, in late May, as U.S. deaths edged toward the ominous threshold of 100,000, Trump called on churches to hold in-person services, contradicting state bans on mass gatherings, declaring them “essential.”
Consistently, he has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly hasn’t spoken to Trump in two weeks. All of these comments and actions have delayed the day when true normalcy will arrive, if not sabotaged it altogether.
For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon.
Public health officials have repeatedly warned against the lifting of restrictions prematurely, especially when many states still lack the testing and contact tracing infrastructure necessary to tamp down inevitable outbreaks. Adding to these worries is the possibility of a new wave, sparked by this week’s mass protests and the gatherings over Memorial Day weekend. The worst-case scenario, scientists say, is a resurgence of the virus this fall in combination with the seasonal flu. The coming months, as ousted vaccine official Rick Bright recently told Congress, could be the “darkest winter in modern history.” Nevertheless, states are vaulting over the federal government’s metrics for a safe reopening in a race to restart their economies. As of June 3, 16 states were reporting a rise in new infections, a number that’s likely to tick upward.
Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Rather than tackle immigration reform, Trump opted for the cheap optics of “building a wall,” a colossal waste of tax-payer money. Rather than negotiate a sensible agreement with China over its unfair trade practices, he levied a series of ill-considered tariffs and set off a trade war that has put U.S.-China relations on its worst footing in decades. And instead of investing in the painstaking work of tamping down COVID-19, he’s scapegoated the World Health Organization and repeatedly touted an anti-malaria drug that doesn’t treat the disease and is now shown to increase the likelihood of death.
The next few months will pose a crucial test of our national resolve and set the country’s trajectory for years to come. Americans need a leader who is honest about the difficulties that lie ahead, undaunted by the scale of the task, and willing to do take on the arduous job of navigating the nation’s recovery. In other words, they need the exact opposite of Trump.
In his speech announcing the moon shot, President John F. Kennedy famously said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Rebuilding a post-pandemic America will be one of the hardest tasks the nation has ever had to face. Unlike the moon shot, with its aspiration and glamour, the goal will be the simple restoration of a life with some semblance to what we had before.
Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go.","['threatens', 'foment', 'tacitly']"

Multiple journalists were injured by Lebanese security forces Wednesday after continued protests in Beirut turned violent as residents continue to demonstrate against the country's government.
Reuters, along with Lebanese broadcasters Al Jadeed and MTV, all said security forces injured cameramen working for them. Local Lebanese journalists also said on social media they were being targeted by security forces during the street clashes.
Demonstrations transformed into riots Tuesday after anti-government protesters began vandalizing banks and security forces began arresting a number of people in the city's Hamra neighborhood. The violent clashes Wednesday erupted after Lebanese security forces attempted to disperse protesters who demanded the release of those arrested the previous night.
Reuters confirmed to NBC News that a cameraman was injured while covering the protests in Beirut, though they did not release his name.
""He was treated in hospital and released,"" Reuters said. ""The wellbeing of our journalists is of paramount importance, so we are concerned by this news and are seeking answers from the local authorities.”

The country's internal security forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Lucien Bourjeily, 39, an activist and filmmaker who has been present at the protests, said security forces were targeting anyone with a camera.
""Anyone who is just holding a phone and recording what is happening is directly targeted,"" Bourjeily said. ""I’ve witnessed it myself, it has been going on since the first day of protests.""
The Beirut resident said he believes the protests have been more violent recently because there are rumors a new government might be forming soon.
""It might not happen, but this is what is being talked about. It’s close to being announced,"" he said. ""I expect it’s in relation to squashing the uprising, to get clean streets for the government to start stealing from us all over again.""
Lebanese Interior Minister Raya El Hassan denounced the violence and implored protesters to remain peaceful in a statement, according to Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International.
""We do not accept the attack of journalists who are doing their duty to cover events and developments, nor do we accept the attack of security forces which are maintaining security,"" El Hassan said, according to LBCI.
The demonstrations that began to sweep across Lebanon in October died down the past few weeks, but have been renewed in recent days. Lebanese citizens from across sectarian divides came together in a rare display in unity late last year after proposed tax hikes enraged an already struggling populace.
After officials reneged on the proposed tax hikes, protesters focused their anger on what they have characterized as a corrupt government that has mishandled the country's economy for years.
Banks began limiting access to funds in October, which in part prompted the protesters' attack on the banks Tuesday night. Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in October, but the country has yet to agree on an economic plan or a new government.","['enraged', 'rare']"

"Fearful and insecure Americans are taking advantage of weak and ineffective gun-control laws and stocking up, as President Trump might say, “like never before.”",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/the-supreme-court-is-poised-to-extend-gun-rights-at-the-worst-possible-time/,alternet,gun-control,left,75.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” —Second Amendment to the United States Constitution
As the deadly COVID-19 contagion sweeps across the country, gun sales are surging, spurred in many regions by panic buying and purchases by first-time firearm owners. Fearful and insecure Americans are taking advantage of weak and ineffective gun-control laws and stocking up, as President Trump might say, “like never before.”
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is poised to issue its first major Second Amendment opinion in more than a decade in a case that originated, fittingly, in New York City, now the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. The case—New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York—has the potential to vastly extend the rights of gun owners, and not just in New York, but throughout the entire nation.
At issue is a New York City “rule” (the term the city uses for its local ordinances) that was adopted in 2001 to prohibit residents from transporting licensed handguns beyond municipal limits. The rule was challenged in a federal lawsuit filed in 2013 by the NRA’s New York affiliate and three individuals. A district court judge ruled in the city’s favor in 2015, as did the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018. The Supreme Court, however, agreed to review the case at the NRA’s request in January 2019, and heard oral arguments in December.
The plaintiffs contend that the city’s handgun transportation ban should be declared unconstitutional because it conflicts with the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 decision on the Second Amendment, District of Columbia v. Heller.
In Heller, the Supreme Court struck down a ban on handgun possession in the nation’s capital, ruling for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to gun ownership. Deeply controversial and hotly contested, Heller split the Supreme Court along strict ideological lines, and was resolved on the basis of a 5-4 vote of the justices. The late Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion stood the prior judicial consensus on the Second Amendment on its head, rejecting the great weight of prior scholarship and earlier court opinions, including the Supreme Court’s 1939 decision in United States v. Miller, that had construed the amendment as protecting gun ownership only in connection with service in long-antiquated state militias.
Scalia’s opinion was met by a blistering dissent written by Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired from the bench in 2010 and passed away last year. Drawing on a wide array of historical sources, Stevens chided Scalia for ignoring the actual debates that took place during the founding era on the ratification of the Constitution and the drafting of the Second Amendment. Those debates, in Stevens’ view, demonstrated the amendment’s purpose was not to safeguard individual gun rights, but to guarantee the survival of the militias as a “collective right” of the citizenry as an alternative to the creation of a large federal standing army.
Stevens lost the battle of persuasion in Heller, and in 2010, in another 5-4 decision that also featured a Stevens dissent—McDonald v. Chicago—the Supreme Court extended Heller, holding that the individual right to keep and bear arms was incorporated by the 14th Amendment’s due process clause and hence was applicable to the states and local governments. The Second Amendment, as interpreted by Scalia, thus became the law of the land.
Although Scalia and Stevens are no longer with us, the ideological divisions they represented remain on the Supreme Court today. Indeed, when it comes to gun rights, the current court is even more conservative than it was in 2008. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both appointed by Trump, are outspoken proponents of Scalia’s vision of the Second Amendment. And the tribunal’s remaining conservatives—Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—participated in Heller and joined Scalia’s majority opinion.
Still, Heller by no means precluded all measures of gun control. As the Second Circuit noted in its evaluation of the New York handgun transportation ban that is now before the court, Heller was technically limited to possession of guns in the home, and established no clear limits on legislation aimed at regulating gun rights outside of the home.
“Like most rights,” Scalia wrote in Heller, “the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… [N]othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”
And in an enigmatic footnote to the above paragraph, Scalia added: “We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.”
Adhering to Scalia’s reasoning, in the years following Heller, lower courts have upheld a broad range of state and local gun-control regulations, a dynamic that has prompted the NRA and other gun-lobby groups to urge the Supreme Court to take up another Second Amendment appeal to reaffirm the amendment’s importance and place stricter limits on gun control. They may have found the perfect test case in the New York transportation ban. Like Heller, the New York ban concerns an outright prohibition, which will be hard, if not impossible, to justify before the court’s conservative majority.
Realizing it would likely lose the case, New York City amended its transportation rule in June to permit residents to take their handguns to second homes, businesses or shooting ranges outside city limits. And in July, the city filed a formal motion with the Supreme Court, requesting that the case be dismissed as moot. The court denied the motion in October, setting the stage for another Second Amendment showdown.
In December’s oral arguments, the city again asked the court to moot the case. The city made no attempt to defend the transportation ban.
Unfortunately, given the city’s capitulation and the Supreme Court’s right-wing orientation, the only real remaining question is the scope of the NRA’s inevitable victory. Even if the court reconsiders the city’s request and enters a dismissal order, the NRA will walk away with a significant win, having forced the city to rescind one of the most stringent gun-control laws in the country. On the other hand, a decision on the merits on constitutional grounds in the NRA’s favor would reward the organization with an even bigger triumph, endangering gun-control laws everywhere.
A nation awash in firearms in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic awaits the court’s decision, which is expected by the end of June.

Many Latino voters know from personal and family experience how U.S. foreign policies drive people from their homes. ,https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/how-u-s-foreign-policy-triggers-crisis-and-immigration/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,75.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"by Brian Concannon, Independent Media Institute
The Democratic candidates missed the opportunity last week in Nevada—a state with a 30 percent Latino population—to address the root causes of our immigration crisis. They predictably criticized the worst Trump administration immigration policies, such as families separated at the border and chronic uncertainty for undocumented people in the U.S., many of whom arrived decades ago as children. How we treat people at or inside our border certainly deserves attention, but we cannot ignore that many people come to the United States in the first place because our foreign policies—by both Democrats and Republicans—force them to leave their homes in Latin America and elsewhere.
The U.S. displaces its neighbors by displacing their governments. The Obama administration supported the 2009 coup d’état against Honduras’ elected President Manuel Zelaya by U.S.-trained generals. The Obama and then the Trump administrations supported repressive and corrupt governments that followed Zelaya’s ouster, giving a green light to assassinations of dissidents and journalists, government-linked drug trafficking, and spiraling crime. This repression continues to drive tens of thousands to seek asylum in the U.S. each year, regardless of the legal obstacles we erect. More recently, the Trump administration supported last November’s military coup d’état in Bolivia—with little opposition from Democrats—deepening that country’s political crisis.
United States aid and trade policies—often touted as helping our neighbors—also drive people from their homes to our borders. NAFTA opened markets for highly efficient and highly subsidized U.S. farmers by lifting tariffs. Less subsidized Mexican farmers could not compete, and overnight lost their livelihood, forcing many to seek replacement livelihoods in the United States. In Haiti, President Bill Clinton admitted—after he left office—to a “devil’s bargain” on rice tariffs that was “good for some of my farmers in Arkansas,” but destroyed rice farming and generated hunger and malnutrition in Haiti.
The failure of the United States to tackle climate change contributes to a global migration crisis. Catastrophic disasters—growing more frequent and severe —displace more than 20 million people each year. This includes Nicaraguans and Hondurans benefitting from Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States since 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, and hundreds of thousands in Central America’s “Dry Corridor,” now facing their sixth year of drought.
The burden of harmful U.S. foreign policies falls disproportionately on women. In African countries struck by droughts, girls are taken out of school to make the longer walk for their family’s water. Repressive governments we support in Brazil, Honduras, and the Philippines keep women “in their place” with regressive laws, and by committing and permitting attacks against women advocates. Women displaced from their homes and headed to our border face a high risk of sexual assault.
Congress recently demonstrated how bipartisan cooperation can achieve more principled and constructive policies. Last spring, both houses of Congress passed a bill by Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) invoking the War Powers Resolution to stop U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen that has displaced 3 million people and killed more than 100,000. President Trump vetoed the bill, but Congress’ War Powers authority, neglected for decades, is now out of the toolbox: on February 13, Senate Republicans and Democrats passed a similar measure to constrain the president’s ability to attack Iran.
The Democratic candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday states, two of which, Texas and California, have 26 million Latinos—more than the total population of any other state. Many Latino voters know from personal and family experience how U.S. policies drive people from their homes. They deserve to know, as do all of us, how candidates will address these root causes of our immigration crisis.
Candidates can start to address the root causes by pledging to respect the choices made by voters in other countries—even if we disagree with them—and ensure that our tax dollars will support economic and social development rather than war. They can announce trade policies that help farmers farm on both sides of the border, and workers everywhere earn a living wage. They can vow to reduce hurricanes, floods, and drought by putting more solar panels on our roofs and less carbon into our atmosphere. In short, the candidates can show how the United States will help our neighbors live secure, dignified lives in their own communities. Because that is a foreign policy that will ultimately benefit all of us.

BERLIN — Berlin is trying to stop Washington from persuading a German company seeking a coronavirus vaccine to move its research to the United States, prompting German politicians to insist no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine.
German government sources told Reuters on Sunday that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by a German firm, CureVac.
Earlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States, and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay.
""The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,"" a Health Ministry spokeswoman said, confirming a quote in the newspaper.
""In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac,"" she added.
A senior American official later said the Welt report was wrong.
""Not true. The Welt story was wrong,"" said Richard Grenell, acting Director of National Intelligence and the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, referring to the newspaper report.
""Now everyone is back peddling,"" he added on Twitter.

Not true. The Welt story was wrong. But Business Insider, Reuters and others went with it anyway despite not having their own sources. Now everyone is back peddling. https://t.co/88UohluwTj — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) March 15, 2020
A German Economy Ministry spokeswoman also said Berlin ""has a great interest"" in producing vaccines in Germany and Europe.
She declined to comment on any takeover possibilities but referred to Germany's foreign trade law, under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU, so-called third countries ""if national or European security interests are at stake.""
In a statement issued Sunday, the company said it ""rejects current rumors of an acquisition.""
The statement added that while it was in contact with ""authorities worldwide,"" it ""abstains from commenting on speculations and rejects allegations about offers for acquisition of the company or its technology.""
A spokesperson for CureVac also denied the report. ""To make it clear again on coronavirus: CureVac has not received from the U.S. government or related entities an offer before, during and since the Task Force meeting in the White House on March 2. CureVac rejects all allegations from press,"" the spokesperson said.
Florian von der Muelbe, CureVac's chief production officer and co-founder, told Reuters last week the company had started with a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and was now selecting the two best to go into clinical trials.
The privately-held company based in Tuebingen, Germany, hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans.
On its website, CureVac said CEO Daniel Menichella early this month met with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine.
Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology who is also a senior lawmaker with Germany's Social Democrats, tweeted in reaction to the Welt am Sonntag report: ""The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means. Capitalism has limits.""
CureVac in 2015 and 2018 secured financial backing for development projects from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, working on shots to prevent malaria and influenza.
In the field of so-called mRNA therapeutics, CureVac competes with U.S. biotech firm Moderna and German rival BioNTech, which Pfizer has identified as a potential collaboration partner.
Drugs based on mRNA provide a type of genetic blueprint that can be injected into the body to instruct cells to produce the desired therapeutic proteins. That contrasts with the conventional approach of making these proteins in labs and bio-reactors.
In the case of vaccines, the mRNA prompts body cells to produce so-called antigens, the tell-tale molecules on the surface of viruses, that spur the immune system into action.
Companies working on other coronavirus-vaccine approaches include Johnson & Johnson and INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

This is why Donald Trump is awake at 2:30 a.m., rage-tweeting. When he sleeps, he dreams, and his dreams are nightmares. He’s a frightened, desperate man. Every day, he turns on his television, and the death count from the COVID-19 virus keeps going up. The economy — the precious economy, the one he’s so proud of for no particular reason — is tanking. His poll numbers are down. His approval ratings are down. He’s losing to Joe Biden in national polls and in every important swing state. Nothing he does is helping.
He has tried everything to beat the virus. First he denied it was a problem. You remember the quotes from February and March: It’s only a few cases. Like magic, it will just go away. Then his people convinced him it wasn’t going away, and he had to do something. So he trotted out a string of corporate execs and golf buddies onto a stage in the Rose Garden and declared a national emergency. Surely that would fix things!
But the virus kept spreading, and people were dying. The NBA canceled its season. So did Major League Baseball and NASCAR. Businesses started closing … General Motors, Ford, big businesses — and then small businesses like restaurants and retail stores and salons and barber shops. Unemployment numbers skyrocketed. Six million. Then another five million. Another six million. And those were just the people out of work who actually applied for unemployment benefits.
The virus kept spreading, and people kept dying. Trump called together a “task force” to confront the problem, and he put his vice president in charge. So Mike Pence started holding briefings in the White House press room with input from experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the one with the shoulder scarves. When all the networks started covering them and the ratings were through the roof, Trump took over the briefings himself.
But things kept getting worse. The virus was everywhere. Hospitals were running out of protective gear like gowns and masks, emergency rooms were overrun, there was a shortage of ventilators. They had to do something, so they printed up a bunch of cards with “guidelines” for something called social distancing that was supposed to last 15 days.
Then Congress got involved and passed some emergency bills. First it was in the billions, then it was in the trillions. Small business loans, hundreds of billions — gone in a matter of days. And still the unemployment numbers went up.
Then they hit the end of the 15 days, and the death count kept going up, so they extended the “guidelines,” and he started pushing a cure his pals were talking about on Fox, some malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine. “What have you got to lose?” he crowed from the podium at the briefings.
Apparently, a lot. People started dying from the hydroxychloroquine, something to do with their hearts. So he stopped pushing the pill, and he pivoted to “opening up” the economy. Away went the “guidelines,” and up popped the tweets: LIBERATE Michigan! LIBERATE Virginia! Let’s get those businesses up and running! He put out new “guidelines” for opening up the economy. Three phases! Real simple! Just get your numbers of new cases down for 14 days, and everything can start getting back to normal!
About half the states announced relaxation of rules, and businesses began to reopen. But the virus kept spreading. Now it was in rural Georgia and Arkansas and Iowa, all those precious red states he could point to that were “doing things right,” that didn’t need to be “bailed out” like “Democrat states.”
The death count kept increasing, and some idiot in the CDC came up with the theory that sunlight and ultraviolet rays could kill the virus. Bleach and other disinfectants definitely killed it (on countertops, that is), so Trump pushed the “light” and the disinfectants “inside” and his whole house of cards fell apart.
They were making fun of him! All those pundits and newspapers and networks he had been having so much fun yelling at during the briefings … they were laughing at him! So he decided he’d show them! He canceled a few briefings, then he showed up for one and walked out after a few minutes. Then he decided he would announce that he was phasing out the “task force.” A day later, he was back in front of the cameras saying he hadn’t realized how “popular” the task force was, so of course he’d keep it going — not because the task force was accomplishing anything, but because it was “popular.”
But behind the scenes, Trump was getting briefings. Terrible briefings. Really awful stuff. His own campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who was reported to have spent his hefty paycheck from the Trump campaign on condos, a luxury boat and a Ferrari, met with him and showed him his internal poll numbers. They were terrible — worse than the public numbers according to some reports. He blew up at Parscale. He was in a rage, screaming at the poor guy at the top of his lungs. All the stuff he’d been doing — all the briefings, all the guidelines, all the trillions in relief money, all the magic cures — and look where it got him! Nowhere!
This week came the private briefings on the economy. They were terrible, according to NBC News. “Some of the projections showed the unemployment rate skyrocketing above 30 percent and the widespread collapse of small businesses, according to multiple people familiar with the briefings.” One projection had more than 50 percent of American small businesses collapsing if the country did not get back to work.
“The projections have infuriated Trump,” one source told NBC. “He lost it.”
He must have “lost it” again on Friday morning when it was announced that unemployment in April hit 14.7 percent. “I think the real number is probably around 23 or 24 percent. It’s devastating,” said Neal Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, on the “Today” show.
Trump got away from the White House for the first time this week, traveling to Arizona (a state where his numbers aren’t where he wants them to be) to visit a factory that makes face masks. Hovering over a worker wearing a mask who was making masks, Trump didn’t wear one. Aides later explained he thought he would look “weak” and “ridiculous” in a face mask.
By Thursday, it was revealed that one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for the virus. This is the person who serves Trump his meals and brings him his Diet Cokes. On Friday, we learned that Katie Miller, an aide to Vice President Pence — who is married to Stephen Miller, Trump’s most nefarious adviser — had tested positive for the virus. Pence was conspicuously unmasked last week during a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, flouting the clinic’s rule that everyone wear masks.
Donald Trump has consistently shown contempt for the coronavirus. Now the virus, which has infected 1.3 million people in this country and killed more than 78,000, has made its way into the White House. Experts were saying on Friday that the virus has probably spread completely through the West Wing. Of course it has. Sources told MSNBC that “no one” in the White House has been observing social distance rules or wearing masks.
Trump’s arrogance and dithering and denial has cost tens of thousands of American lives and will cost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, more. He is the president, and he is supposedly in charge, and nothing he has done has worked. His scattershot plan to “reopen” the economy won’t save him. Blaming China or Barack Obama or Joe Biden or anyone else won’t save him. He is a defeated, desperate man. We still have to vote in the election in November, but he has already lost. The virus beat him.","['rage-tweeting', 'nightmares', 'desperate', 'frightened']"
"On the other hand, it’s also true that men often use the “it’s not me, it’s the world” cover to discourage women’s dreams and ambitions, and often for self-serving reasons.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/the-new-battle-over-sexism-hurts-both-warren-and-sanders-but-for-different-reasons/,alternet,gender,left,76.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Late on the day before the first Democratic primary debate of the year — and the last one before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 — CNN published a report saying that during a meeting early last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont had told Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his primary opponent and friend, that a woman couldn’t win the 2020 presidential election.
After many hours, Warren’s campaign released a terse statement noting that while it was true that Sanders had told her “he disagreed” with her belief that a female Democrat could win, she had no desire to discuss a “private meeting” because “Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry,” noting that the two progressive New England senators have long been “friends and allies”.
Sanders, for his part, claimed that “staff who weren’t in the room are lying about what happened” and characterized the conversation as one where he told Warren “that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could” and insisting that he does believe “a woman can win in 2020.”
On social media, accusations of lying flew wildly, and Warren supporters leaned heavily on the language of #MeToo and believing women — even though, to be absolutely clear, no one is accusing Sanders of doing anything untoward. But this not-quite-dispute was nonetheless being positioned as a “he said/she said” situation, where one of them had to be lying and the answer was determined by whom you happen to support.
But the truth is, as philosopher Kate Manne explained on Twitter, there’s a space where both interpretations of this conversation have legitimacy. On one hand, it’s true that a female candidate would face an uphill battle against the ingrained sexism of the electorate, not to mention the vicious misogyny of Donald Trump. So it makes sense that Sanders sees these comments merely as “telling it like it is,” even if one wonders why he seemed to feel that Warren needed telling, when she’s got a lifetime of direct experience.
On the other hand, it’s also true that men often use the “it’s not me, it’s the world” cover to discourage women’s dreams and ambitions, and often for self-serving reasons. Many women have had the experience of a man who, because he likes having someone else do the housework or because he feels his ego is threatened, “informs” a woman in his life that she must scale back her goals because of sexism — not his sexism, of course, but you know, someone else’s.
So it’s entirely possible that both things are true and no one is lying: Warren heard him say a woman couldn’t win this election, and Sanders felt he was just telling it like it is. This would also explain why Warren is insisting this is no big deal, as his comments were, at worst, a bit of self-serving mansplaining rather than a real effort to shoot down her campaign.
No doubt Tuesday night’s debate in Des Moines will help clarify these issues. In the meantime, it would do well for supporters of both candidates to dial down the conspiracy theorizing that’s going on right now. Despite some of my off-the-cuff speculation Monday night Twitter, in the cold light of day I think the ugly truth is that this story hurts both candidates, potentially quite badly.
For Sanders, the damage is obvious enough. Because Bernie has a flock of stalwart fans who are super-duper-don’t-bother-denying-it sexist, and who enjoy trolling and demonizing feminists online and then turning around and condescending to women in real life, plenty of feminists are suspicious that Sanders himself harbors some old-fashioned views about keeping that glass ceiling in place, even if he wouldn’t admit to them. Call it the pig-attracts-pig theory of politics, and this story is seen as justification for these fears.
I think this is an overblown fear. The truth is that a lot of people share the concerns that Sanders reportedly expressed in his meeting with Warren. I’ve had more women than men privately tell me that they think a woman can’t win this time around. More to the point, whether or not Sanders, like all liberal men and plenty of women, has stubborn prejudices lurking in his heart (though woe unto those who acknowledge it), what matters far more is that he has signed onto the feminist agenda and, if elected, would almost certainly promote policies meant to ensure women’s equality.
And while there are also plenty of Sanders stans distastefully proclaiming that Warren is a snake and a liar, in truth this story does nothing to help Warren, and if anything is likely to hurt her worse than it hurts Sanders. As Manne noted in her Twitter thread, “(even lightly) challenging a powerful white man’s moral judgment is among the ultimate bases for misogynist aggression.”
Writer Moira Donegan agreed, tweeting that “women get no rewards from complaining about sexism.”
One would hope, after #MeToo, that this lesson would have sunk in: Women fear speaking out at all, because while there’s no certainty that it will make any difference in male behavior, you can be absolutely certain that it will make your personal life a living hell from all the blowback you’re likely to receive. That’s true when the subject is as serious an issue as rape. When it’s something minor, like a bit of obnoxious but ultimately harmless mansplaining, the costs outweigh any potential benefit.
Hopefully, Sanders and Warren will be able to answer the inevitable questions about this during Tuesday’s debate in a way that allows for empathy and nuance, instead of flattening these two complicated and important progressive figures into caricatures of a lying woman and a piggish man.
What’s particularly galling about this is that the Warren v. Sanders narrative, by serving to undermine both of them, most clearly benefits former Vice President Joe Biden, who may well be able to slide in and yank the nomination from the wreckage. A few weeks ago, Biden made a similar statement in public to the one Sanders allegedly made in private, in a speech where he said that while Hillary Clinton faced sexism in 2016, “that’s not going to happen with me.” It would be particularly ironic if he were the one to benefit from all of this, although that might please the major donors and middle-road centrists who aren’t comfortable with either Sanders or Warren.
In the meantime, I hope that this can open up a larger discussion about how women are subtly discouraged, often by people who think of themselves as well-meaning, from having greater ambitions, and how that discouragement can help contribute to women’s inequality.
For instance, research shows the main reason that there are far fewer women holding public office than men is that fewer women run for office in the first place. This drip-drip-drip of “concerns” from people in your life telling you that a woman can’t make it gets into women’s heads and they quit before they’ve even tried. The worst part is that the “concerns” are overblown. Of course women face sexism when they run for office, but in the end, they are just as likely as men to win.
The reality is that if women wait until the public is “ready” for women to run for higher office, direct Hollywood films or otherwise grab for the kind of power men have typically hoarded for themselves, then women will wait forever. Sexism isn’t like the common cold, where if we just rest up and sip some chicken soup, it will pass in due time. Sexist attitudes are changed because people go out there and change them. The public will become ready to have women in power the same way they became ready for the first black president: Because someone runs for the office and wins. Warren, unlike Barack Obama, has the advantage of having someone who paved the way ahead of her. As Bernie Sanders reminded us in his response to all this, won nearly 3 million more votes than Donald Trump in 2016.
There’s a chance here to have a productive conversation about what’s really holding women back and how to fight it. It just requires everyone to simmer down a bit. Sanders fans need to admit that their man, being human, could have said something blinkered and self-serving. Warren fans need to admit that whatever Sanders’ blind spots and graceless comments may be, he’s got a long track record of support for feminist policies. And everyone needs to admit they can vote for their preferred candidate without proclaiming that every other candidates is the devil.","['self-serving', 'it’s']"
Fox News has gone so deep into white nationalism that Donald Trump now believes it’s how he’ll win in 2020,https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,76.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump’s racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are “originally” from somewhere else and should therefore “go back” — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.
Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it’s a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.
As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump “believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.”
There’s good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, “Trump’s popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,” and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.
So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.
For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Such “birther” theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be “real” Americans.
Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.
Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. “Replacement theory” — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and “replaced” by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that’s become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are “invading the country” and can never be “fully American,” and that demographic changes from immigration are “more change than human beings are designed to digest” and inherently a threat to “your neighborhood.”
The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be “tipping over a cliff.”
This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['deep', 'white', 'nationalism']"
"And although nearly every Republican has sold their souls to Trump, none of them want to cross someone with the moral authority of Gen. Mattis, who counseled Americans in no uncertain terms to abandon Trump.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/republicans-are-reeling-as-trump-comes-under-fire/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,77.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A bold statement Wednesday from former Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis eviscerating Donald Trump has landed like a bomb in the Senate Republican caucus, sending members fleeing in all different directions.
While many Senate Republicans are doing their usual duck and dodge move, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made some truly notable remarks about Mattis’ contention that Trump is a threat to the U.S. Constitution.
“When I saw General Mattis’ comments yesterday I felt like perhaps we are getting to a point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally,” Murkowski said, calling Mattis’ words “true, and honest, and necessary and overdue.”
Murkowski said she was “struggling” with whether to support Trump, adding: “I think right now we are all struggling to find ways to express the words that need to be expressed appropriately, questions about who I’m going to vote for, not going to vote for, I think are distracting at the moment.”
Murkowski clearly isn’t done talking yet, noting that she was “working as one individual to form the right words.”
But Murkowski’s acknowledgment that she is virtually alone in her caucus is accurate. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is the only other Senate Republican so far to willingly remark on Mattis’ excoriation of Trump, called the retired Marine four-star general “an American patriot” and his letter “stunning and powerful.”
Practically every other Senate Republican is burying their head in the sand even as they refrain from criticizing a person of Mattis’ stature.
As he left the Senate floor, GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell silently brushed past reporters inquiring about the letter. That’s the second time this week McConnell has gone silent. He also couldn’t bring himself to comment on whether he supported Trump’s threat to use military force on American citizens.
Other members of the GOP caucus also shrank from questions. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa declined to comment. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered, “I didn’t see what he said.” Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, originally suggested Mattis had been duped and misquoted by the press. (Note: Mattis issued a lengthy statement of his own volition.) Told that Mattis actually wrote a letter and asked again whether he agreed with the content of it, Inhofe ducked. “I don’t agree that I should pass judgment on what he should be writing,” he said.
And then there’s the simply next-level stupidity of Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Asked about Mattis’ withering criticism of Trump forcibly clearing peaceful protesters for his bizarro photo op, Johnson offered: “I still haven’t seen any footage of how the crowd was cleared out.” Just a total news blackout over there in Johnson’s bunker. Johnson did, however, say Mattis was “free to express” his opinion. Bold.
Don’t expect any Senate Republicans to declare a meaningful break from Trump anytime soon. As conservative commentator George Will told MSNBC Wednesday, Senate Republicans have “outsourced their consciences.”
But Murkowski’s comments undoubtedly make life more difficult for vulnerable Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado. It’s why McConnell and Ernst, who are both up for reelection, chose to just keep their traps shut. And although nearly every Republican has sold their souls to Trump, none of them want to cross someone with the moral authority of Gen. Mattis, who counseled Americans in no uncertain terms to abandon Trump.
“We can unite without him,” Mattis wrote, an extraordinary comment for a man who spent 40 years deferring to the orders of U.S. presidents.","['souls', 'sold']"
"However, much discrimination in today’s workplace is not intentional but fueled by unconscious gender stereotypes.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/heres-why-women-still-earn-a-lot-less-than-men/,alternet,gender,left,77.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"A decade ago, on Jan. 29, 2009, newly inaugurated President Barack Obama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.
It was the latest legislative effort to close the persistently stubborn gap between how much women and men earn. At the time, women made just 77 cents of every dollar men earned – a level that hadn’t improved all that much since the 1990s, according to Census data.
While existing laws already prohibited gender-based wage discrimination, the Ledbetter Act gave workers more time to sue employers over the issue. And the hope was that it would make a big difference.
So did it?
My research explores the legal hurdles that have prevented women from achieving pay equity with men. Now, 10 years after the act was passed, more work still needs to be done.
Ledbetter’s complaint
The Ledbetter Act overturned a Supreme Court case that ruled against Lilly Ledbetter, who worked as an area manager at Goodyear Tire and Rubber for more than 19 years. Over time, her pay slipped until she was earning 15 percent to 40 percent less than her male counterparts.
When an anonymous note tipped her off about the extent of the disparity, Ledbetter filed a pay discrimination complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a statute prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. A jury found in her favor and awarded more than US$3.5 million in damages.
The case was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which in 2007 ruled 5-4 that employees must file a complaint within 180 days after their employer makes a pay decision. The fact that the discrimination was embedded in each paycheck and that Ledbetter didn’t know of the disparity for many years did not matter. Time had run out on her claim.
In a vehement dissent read from the bench, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the ruling denied workplace realities. She pointed out that since employees often lack information about pay disparities, which can accumulate slowly over time, they shouldn’t be given such a narrow window in which to file a complaint.
Ultimately, the 111th Congress and President Obama agreed with Justice Ginsburg and nullified the decision. The Ledbetter Act makes clear that the statute of limitations for filing a wage discrimination claim resets with each discriminatory paycheck.
A disappointing impact
The law’s impact, however, has been disappointing.
The rate of new wage discrimination cases hasn’t budged, primarily because employees still lack information about their co-workers’ pay. Salary discussions are taboo in most workplaces, and some employers, like Ledbetter’s, forbid it.
Put simply, a woman can’t file a complaint if she doesn’t know she’s being shortchanged.
Title VII wage claims are hard to prove for other reasons too. Title VII generally requires proof that employers acted with discriminatory intent. However, much discrimination in today’s workplace is not intentional but fueled by unconscious gender stereotypes.
For instance, studies show that workers receive better performance evaluations when they conform to gender stereotypes, such as dominance for men and passivity for women. In one study, participants were asked to award merit-based bonuses to fictional employees with identical personnel files. Men got higher bonuses than women.
The bottom line: Women today earn about 80 cents for every dollar men make earn, up just a few cents since 2009.
And for women of color, the gap is even starker. Latinas earn 52 cents to the dollar of white men, while African-American women earn just 61 cents. Within racial groups, a pay gap between men and women persists, although it is narrower.
Narrow interpretations
Of course, employees who believe they are being discriminated against based on gender can also turn to the Equal Pay Act. This act, signed into law in 1963 when women earned only 60 cents for every dollar men earned, does not require a showing of employer intent to discriminate.
The act was the first to prohibit employers from paying men more than women who perform equal work.
The pay gap has since narrowed by about 20 cents, but not because of anti-discrimination laws. The main drivers have been women’s increased educational attainment and entry into the workforce.
The Equal Pay Act hasn’t been effective because courts read the law narrowly. They generally require that women plaintiffs identify a man with an identical job and resume for comparison. Given that men and women are tracked into different occupations, this can often be impossible.
Moreover, both Title VII and the Equal Pay Act allow employers to defend pay differentials on the basis of “any factor other than sex.” For example, courts have permitted a limitless array of employer excuses for paying women less that are themselves rooted in gender bias, such as women’s weaker salary bargaining skill, lesser management potential or lower prior salary history.
These statutory interpretations may sound technical, but they matter. They help explain why the gap appears stuck at 80 cents and why some estimate it’ll be at least until 2059 until pay equity in the United States is reached.
Why it persists
Another reason the gap is so stubborn is that men and women are steered into different occupations, and male-dominated occupations pay more for comparable work.
Even within a traditionally male field such as computer programming, women are paid less. And, as women move into a field, the entire occupation’s wages sink.
Importantly, economists have found that discrimination feeds as much as 38 percent of the gender gap.
Skeptics of the gender gap argue that it results from women’s choices to work fewer hoursand stay home to raise children.
It’s true, women bear a larger responsibility for child rearing and thus may cut back their hours or take time off from the workplace – especially because the United States is the only developed country without paid maternity leave and child care is expensive.
But while mothers face a “motherhood penalty” in opportunities and pay, fathers reap a “fatherhood bonus.”
And so-called “choices” cannot explain why female recent college graduates are paid 82 percent of their male counterparts or why the gap widens at the top. Professional women with advanced degrees who work full-time face a gender gap of 74 percent.
Closing the gender gap
Closing the gender pay gap is not rocket science – even though recently graduated female rocket scientists earn 89 cents on the dollar to their male peers.
Steps that would help include prohibiting employers from using salary history in setting wages, banning employer retaliation against employees who share wage information, providing greater transparency in pay, and revising Title VII and the Equal Pay Act to better address workplace realities.
The proposed Paycheck Fairness Act – introduced repeatedly in Congress since 1997 but never passed – would codify many of these remedies at the federal level. And the Trump administration suspended an Obama-era requirement that employers report extensive pay data.
While federal efforts stall, several states, including California, Oregon, Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey, have passed their own laws to close the gap.
The economic gains from closing the gender pay gap are huge. Doing so would add about $513 billion to the economy because of the extra income generated, reduce poverty and do a lot to support American families since mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners in about half of them.
Passing the Lilly Ledbetter Act was a start, and now we owe it to American workers to enact laws that close the gap once and for all.","['intentional', 'gender', 'stereotypes', 'unconscious']"

On Sept. 15, 2017, Olivia stepped into a full-body scanner at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
When she stepped out, a female Transportation Security Administration officer approached. On the scanner’s screen was an outline of a human body with the groin highlighted. The officer told Olivia that because of something the scanner had detected, a pat-down would be necessary.
As a transgender woman, Olivia, 36, had faced additional TSA scrutiny before. On those occasions, a manual search at the checkpoint had been enough to assure TSA officers that there wasn’t a weapon or explosive hidden in her undergarments.
This encounter with the TSA went very differently.
After patting down Olivia and testing her hands for explosive residue, the officer said that she still couldn’t clear Olivia to board her flight and that a further search would be required.
Olivia was led to a private room where, she said, the officer patted her down again, running her hands down Olivia’s legs and over her groin.
“I told her: ‘If the issue is what you are feeling, let me tell you what this is. It is my penis,’” said Olivia, who agreed to be interviewed only if she were identified by her middle name because she fears people will treat her differently if they know she is transgender.
Soon after, three other TSA officers, all of them women and at least one of them a supervisor, entered the room, Olivia said.
TSA rules require that passengers be searched by officers of the same gender as they present. But, according to Olivia, the TSA supervisor told her that she would have to be patted down by a male officer.
After Olivia refused to be searched by a man, the officers told her that because she was not consenting to a search, she could not board her flight and would be escorted out of the terminal.
Olivia said she started crying and pleaded with the officers. “Can I just show you?” she recalled asking them.
TSA officers aren’t supposed to allow passengers to remove undergarments. But Olivia said the officers in the room with her did not object when Olivia pulled her ruffled, black and white skirt and underwear down to her ankles.
Olivia was then cleared to continue to her gate.
A Flawed System
What happened that day traumatized Olivia, who is now fearful of airports, and what she experienced reflects the worst fears of many transgender travelers, who say the TSA is failing them.
Shortcomings in the technology used by the TSA and insufficient training of the agency’s staff have made transgender and gender nonconforming travelers particularly vulnerable to invasive searches at airport checkpoints, interviews and a review of documents and data shows.
The TSA says that it is committed to treating all travelers equally and respectfully. But while the agency has known about the problems for several years, it still struggles to ensure the fair treatment of transgender and gender nonconforming people.
To understand the extent of the problem, ProPublica reviewed publicly available complaint data from the TSA’s website and asked transgender travelers to provide accounts of their experiences at airport checkpoints.
The review, which covered civil rights complaints filed from January 2016 through April 2019, found that 5%, or 298 complaints, were related to screening of transgender people, even though they are estimated to make up slightly less than 1% of the population.
This may understate the proportion of complaints from transgender travelers. When Olivia contacted the TSA, her complaint was filed in a different category — a catchall classification called “sex/gender/gender identity – not transgender.” That category accounts for 15% of the civil rights complaints in the period examined by ProPublica, but the TSA said it did not have a more specific breakdown of these complaints and could not say how many were, like Olivia’s, related in some way to gender identity and screening. ProPublica filed a Freedom of Information Act request in April seeking information about each complaint in those categories, but the agency has not yet provided any response.
When ProPublica asked transgender and gender nonconforming people to tell us about their experiences, we received 174 responses, many of them recounting humiliating treatment after being flagged by full-body scanners for additional scrutiny. Of those people, only 14 said they filed a complaint with the TSA. Many of those who did not file complaints said they didn’t know how, were afraid of outing themselves or didn’t want to relive the experience.
Some of the travelers who responded to ProPublica said they were asked by TSA officers to lift clothing to show private parts of their bodies or were pressured to expose their genitals so that TSA officers would allow them to pass through the security checkpoint.
“Transgender people have complained of profiling and other bad experiences of traveling while trans since TSA’s inception and have protested its invasive body scanners since they were first introduced in 2010,” said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality, or NCTE.
The TSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, was created in an overhaul of transportation security after the 2001 terrorist attacks, with the mission to prevent similar tragedies. The agency, replacing a patchwork of private security providers, initially used metal detectors, which had been standard at checkpoints for years. But after a passenger attempted to blow up a plane in 2009 with plastic explosives hidden in his underwear, the agency began using full-body scanners.
The new scanners were designed to detect potential threats that are not necessarily metal. But TSA officers can’t tell by looking at the monitor whether the machine is detecting a weapon, or as in Olivia’s case, a body part that the scanner was not programmed to associate with a woman.
Since implementing the scanning technology, the agency has grappled with privacy and discrimination issues. Like the transgender and gender nonconforming communities, people with disabilities, people who wear religious head coverings and women of color, whose hairstyles trigger the body scanners to alarm more frequently, have raised concerns about profiling and invasive screening.
Jenny Burke, the TSA’s press secretary, said the screening is done “without regard to a person’s race, color, sex, gender identity, national origin, religion or disability.”
In February, the agency rolled out a new online transgender awareness training, mandatory for its 43,000 screeners, and is studying options for better technology, Burke said.
But advocates and some lawmakers said the improvements have taken too long for a federal agency that interacts with the public more than many others. On an average day, TSA officers screen more than 2 million people and manually search many of them.
“For many, TSA is not just the public face of government — but its hands, too. Its success as a security agency depends upon the trust and compliance of a diverse public,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said during his opening statement at a Homeland Security Committee hearing in June.
Transgender people have faced growing uncertainty about whether their civil rights are protected by the federal government. In May, the Trump administration announced plans to roll back protections for transgender people under nondiscrimination laws. Earlier last year, the administration barred transgender people from serving in the military. As ProPublica reported last year, some states bar transgender people from obtaining a state-issued ID that matches their gender presentation unless they provide proof they’ve had surgery.
False Alarms
Most of the incidents ProPublica reviewed for this story started with a body scanner issuing an alarm.
Before a person steps into the full body scanner at an airport, a TSA officer must register the person’s gender, pressing a pink button for a female or a blue button for a male. Generally, the officers make the decision in seconds, based on a person’s appearance.
The body scanner is programmed to look for penises on passengers scanned as male and breasts on passengers scanned as female. If the officer selects the female button and the machine detects something in the passenger’s groin area — like in Olivia’s case — it could interpret a body part as a potential threat, issuing an alarm.
ProPublica also spoke to several cisgender women who said they were flagged for additional scrutiny after a TSA officer scanned them as male, causing their breasts to trigger the alarm. (“Cisgender” describes someone who identifies with the sex they were assigned at birth, meaning they are not transgender.) The women told ProPublica that they believed the officers scanned them as male because they had short hair or, in one case, because they were wearing baggy clothes.
Peter Neffenger, who served as TSA administrator for the last 18 months of the Obama administration, said he heard again and again about the anxiety brought on by the scanners.
“As many in the transgender community explained to me, it’s one of the most stressful parts of the screening process for them,” Neffenger said.
In September 2018, Terra Fox, a transgender woman, was at the airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on her way to a conference in Orlando, Florida. When she walked through the body scanner, the machine showed a yellow box over her groin.
Fox said she told the officers at the checkpoint that she is a transgender woman and that the machine was merely detecting her genitals.
Fox asked to be patted down by a woman, but the female officers near her refused to do it.
According to Fox, two male officers brought her to a private room and instructed her to pull down her leggings and show them her genitals. She complied, but the screening lasted so long that she missed her flight. She said the experience has taken a toll on her.
“Every time I travel, I have to cry and feel humiliated,” she said.
Fox has to travel for work frequently and said she doesn’t have the option of avoiding airports.
Allister McGuire, a transgender man who lives on Long Island, N.Y., said he didn’t fly for five years after an experience in the St. Louis Lambert International Airport in 2014. McGuire was taken to a private room after the body scanner went off, displaying a yellow patch on his chest.
“I was very nervous,” McGuire said. “I did not feel safe.”
The two male officers in the room told McGuire to remove his chest binder, a cloth undershirt some trans men and gender nonconforming people use to flatten their chests, and then lifted each of his breasts with their hands, McGuire said. He was eventually allowed to leave, but he said he immediately had to take anxiety medication.
McGuire said he did not file a complaint.
In an interview with ProPublica, McGuire wondered: “If I was coming through as a woman, would [the officers] be touching me like that?”
Burke, the TSA press secretary, said that the agency does not conduct strip searches, but that travelers may be required to “adjust clothing” during the pat-downs. The agency didn’t respond to detailed questions about the allegations made by Fox and McGuire.
Neffenger said that during his time as TSA’s administrator, officers were not supposed to ask people to take off their clothes during a screening. But he acknowledged that it was difficult to keep such an enormous workforce consistently trained.
“It wouldn’t surprise me if you said you discovered that people have asked people to undress,” Neffenger told ProPublica. “It’s a big organization; it’s got a lot of turnover.”
The overall attrition rate for the TSA officers is 17%, which is roughly in line with the federal workforce, according to a report this year by the inspector general for DHS. But officers leave the TSA voluntarily at a higher rate than other federal employees, according to the report, which said “retention and training challenges are contributing factors to airport security weaknesses.”
Neffenger spent 33 years serving in the U.S. Coast Guard before being appointed in 2015 to lead the TSA. He arrived amid fallout from damning revelations about the agency. A leaked government report showed that TSA officers had failed to detect nearly all weapons and explosives smuggled through by DHS investigators during a secret test.
Neffenger said his immediate focus as administrator was to develop a nationwide training program. It was a challenging task, he said, because the intrusive nature of the screening process will inevitably make both passengers and officers uncomfortable.
“Pat-downs are, by definition, invasive,” Neffenger said. “What [TSA officers] are asked to do is stuff people don’t like to do.”
Public Comments
TSA officers would need to do fewer pat-downs if the agency had better technology.
The agency uses a machine called a millimeter wave scanner at nearly every airport in the U.S. The machines, manufactured by L3Harris Technologies, rely on an algorithm to analyze images of a passenger’s body and identify any threats concealed by the person’s clothes.
The TSA has spent about $110 million deploying the machines, which cost about $150,000 each, according to a government report.
Since the TSA began deploying body scanners at airports, LGBTQ advocates have expressed concern that the new screening procedures would disproportionately affect transgender travelers.
In a letter to then-TSA Administrator John Pistole in December 2010, NCTE, the Transgender Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights described two incidents in which transgender men were interrogated by TSA officers because their bodies looked different in the scanners than what the officers expected. The organizations urged Pistole to take immediate action to stop discrimination against transgender people. In a written response, Pistole said the agency was “working hard to respond to the concerns of the traveling public.”
In 2010, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, sued DHS in response to the TSA’s decision to make body scanners the primary screening system at airports. EPIC argued that the agency should have given the public an opportunity to comment on the technology before it was implemented. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in favor of EPIC in 2011, though the TSA didn’t begin accepting comments until 2013.
“They are now blaming the scanners when part of the rule-making process is to surface these kinds of issues,” said Jeramie Scott, director of EPIC’s Domestic Surveillance Project.
Burke said the agency procures equipment, such as body scanners, that can accommodate the largest demographic possible. Burke said the TSA does not develop its own technology and solicits private companies to develop scanners that meet the agency’s needs.
Neffenger said talking to transgender people and advocates helped him realize that the agency had to do better.
“You really have to design a system that is as close to 100% as possible,” he said.
The TSA and L3Harris Technologies did not respond to questions about how the scanner’s algorithm processes images to determine threats. (In June, L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation merged to form L3Harris, which has about 48,000 employees and is a key government contractor.)
In a written statement, Jennifer Barton, a spokeswoman for L3Harris, said details about the company’s research and development are confidential. She also said the company is working “with the TSA” on new technology and products that meet the agency’s “evolving requirements and the needs of all passengers.”
“We recognize the importance of ensuring that security scanning equipment accommodate all gender identities, and that is why (the company) is developing technology that moves away from the current male/female imagery and will safely screen passengers without the use of gender-specific images,” Barton wrote.
Barton didn’t respond to follow-up questions about when the technology would be ready for use at airports.
Beyond Technology
While Olivia was searched in the private room in Fort Lauderdale, her fiancee, Marguerite, was waiting on one of the benches near the security checkpoint. Olivia, a trial lawyer, and Marguerite, a school psychologist, had been dating for a year and were planning to marry that winter. The couple were on their way to New York for Marguerite’s brother’s wedding, and Marguerite was worried that they might miss their flight.
“I didn’t know if I could call the police,” Marguerite said. “I didn’t know what my rights were.”
Olivia said she is used to people questioning her appearance — and even her right to exist — because she is transgender. Showing her naked body to TSA officers, however, was a level of invasiveness she wasn’t prepared for.
“The whole weekend of the wedding I replayed the situation in my mind. It ruined the trip,” she said. “As a lawyer I am used to being in control of the situation, but that situation just completely went off the rails.”
Days after the incident, she filed a detailed complaint with the TSA. Her account describes actions, such as the directive that she submit to being searched by a man, that would violate TSA policy.
Burke, the TSA press secretary, said transgender people are supposed to be patted down by an officer of the same gender that they present.
A TSA officer, who has worked as a screener since 2016 and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the officers should not have allowed Olivia to expose herself.
“The moment she [Olivia] said she was going to take her clothes off, they had to say: No, we can’t allow that. That is completely against SOP [standard operating procedure],” the TSA officer said.
Olivia said if she’d known she had the right to bring a witness into the private room, Marguerite would have been there with her.
Six weeks after she filed her complaint, on Oct. 31, 2017, Olivia received a letter from the TSA’s Office for Civil Rights and Liberties, Ombudsman and Traveler Engagement. The letter shared the conclusions of the agency’s investigation into the incident: “Our review to date does finds [sic] that the TSA officers and staff did follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in the overall screening and the pat down procedures,” it said.
According to the letter, the agency’s investigation involved “a collection and review of eye-witness statements, close circuit television footage, and any other evidence tending to prove or disprove a traveler’s factual allegations.”
The two-page letter didn’t address Olivia’s claim that she had to expose her genitals to TSA officers.
“My complaint came back and it was not at all what I said had happened,” Olivia said.
Eventually, Olivia filed a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, request for the evidence the TSA said it reviewed to investigate her allegations. Her request was denied.
“Nobody called me, nobody did anything, they completely blocked my FOIA request,” she said.
ProPublica also submitted a FOIA request for documents related to the investigation into the incident, along with a privacy waiver signed by Olivia to allow ProPublica to access her records. The agency has yet to provide ProPublica with any of the requested records, citing a backlog in FOIA requests.
ProPublica reviewed the narrative that Olivia included in her original complaint to the TSA, as well as photos she took of the officers involved and an audio recording she made at the end of the incident, to corroborate her description of events.
The agency told ProPublica that it does not have cameras in private screening rooms and did not respond to questions about the incident or Olivia’s complaint.
ProPublica contacted one of the officers at her home in South Florida, but she declined to comment. We could not locate the other two officers.
Deficient Training
TSA officers and supervisors started taking a 30-minute online course titled “Transgender Awareness Training” in February. The course is supposed to teach employees how to interact with transgender people respectfully, according to a one-page summary of the training provided by the TSA.
Burke said that the agency would not provide a copy of the training materials because they are “sensitive security information.”
ProPublica reviewed hundreds of posts and comments from a private Facebook group for current and former TSA employees called “TSA Breakroom.” The conversations in the group, which has more than 18,000 members and is not administered by the TSA, shed some light on the content of the training.
In a series of discussions earlier this year, group members, some of them withholding their names, complained about the program. One of the anonymous posts said the course in the Online Learning Center, or OLC, instructed officers to introduce themselves to passengers by stating their name and the pronouns the officer uses.
This kind of introduction is common in the LGBTQ community, but dozens of group members wrote that they didn’t understand the instructions or would not be willing to introduce themselves that way.
Many group members wrote that they worried passengers would be upset if officers asked them about their gender identity.
“I shook my head through that whole dang course,” one member commented in April 2019. “Someone will throat punch me if I say that stupid shit.”
Other group members wrote that the training didn’t address the fundamental problem that the scanners have only male and female options.
“I got a pink button and blue button. Which one you want?” one group member wrote.
The current TSA officer who spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity said that she came up with her own ways to screen transgender passengers.
“I flip a coin in my head and hit a button, wait for the person to walk out of the scan, point at the screen and ask the person: Did I scan you right?” the officer said. “It is sort of a discreet way of asking.” If the passenger’s answer is no, the officer asks the passenger to walk through the scanner again and hits the other button.
Another TSA employee, who has worked for the agency for over a decade and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the gender buttons are stressful for both passengers and officers.
“A lot of the traveling public already hate us,” she said. “We don’t want to offend people by [scanning them] wrong.”
Some members of Congress have tried to address discrimination against transgender people at TSA checkpoints through legislation. In 2018, Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., introduced the Screening With Dignity Act, which proposed funding for TSA training and education and a feasibility study for retrofitting or replacing the millimeter wave scanners. The bill died in the Homeland Security Committee and has not been reintroduced this year.
“It is clear that TSA needs to reassess its technological capabilities and improve its screening procedures to be more inclusive,” said Rice, who was the district attorney for Nassau County, on Long Island, before being elected to Congress. “No one should have to go through airport security scared that they might be humiliated, discriminated against or outed.”
In a 2015 survey of transgender Americans, NCTE found that of respondents who had gone through airport security in the last year, 43% had a problem at the checkpoint related to being transgender.
Many transgender people fear interacting with law enforcement in any setting. According to the NCTE survey, 57% of respondents said they would be afraid to ask the police for help.
Fox, the transgender woman who said she was asked to expose her genitals at the airport in Albuquerque, said her boyfriend encouraged her to file a complaint, but she decided against it.
“Dealing with the legal system is scary,” Fox said.
Lasting Trauma
When Olivia left the private room where she was searched at the Fort Lauderdale airport, she ran to Marguerite, who was waiting for her on the bench, and wept.
“Calm down, calm down, get your stuff together,” Marguerite can be heard telling Olivia in the audio recording Olivia took on her phone near the end of the incident.
From the time Olivia stepped in the body scanner to the time she was allowed to head to her flight, the encounter spanned just 20 minutes. But it’s been impossible to forget.
Marguerite and Olivia, who married last year, have traveled a few times since the September 2017 trip. Marguerite prints the screening procedures from the TSA website and keeps a copy in her purse, in case she has to show it to a TSA officer.
Each time they travel, Olivia panics as she approaches an airport checkpoint.
“I feel my heart speed up. I start thinking: It is going to happen again, it is going to happen again, it is going to happen again,” she said.
This May, while flying back to Florida from North Carolina, a TSA officer asked Olivia to step aside. The airport body scanner issued an alarm in her groin area. The officer patted her over her jeans and allowed her to head to her flight.
When she left the checkpoint, Olivia ran to Marguerite, who held her as she cried.","['Shortcomings', 'insufficient', 'invasive']"
"While Americans still cling to sexist gender roles at home, overwhelming majorities believe that sex discrimination in public spaces should be illegal.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/republicans-want-to-make-sex-discrimination-legal-and-theyre-moving-fast/,alternet,gender,left,78.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"There are many reasons that Republicans and conservative activists love Donald Trump, but among the top must be that he makes it much easier for them to enact their wildly unpopular agenda. Trump’s all-consuming ability to grab the headlines and dominate news coverage creates an opportunity for the far right to push for its regressive agenda, safe in the knowledge that such efforts (understandably) will get little attention from a media addicted to the Trump Show.
Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to the conservative battle to make sex discrimination legal. This fight is a particularly difficult one for the right, politically speaking. While Americans still cling to sexist gender roles at home, overwhelming majorities believe that sex discrimination in public spaces should be illegal. So conservative activists are turning to their favorite weapons — bad faith and distraction — to advance an agenda of gender inequality.
On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to analyze the possibility of amending the U.S. Constitution so that it explicitly bars discrimination based on sex. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) simply states that that equal rights cannot be denied “on account of sex.” It was first introduced in 1923, but ratification of it became a serious issue in the 1970s, when feminist activists began convincing states to ratify it. They got famously and tantalizingly close, falling just three states short of ratification before hitting a 1982 deadline created by Congress.
While many have long assumed the ERA is forever dead, like Jon Snow, it’s rising again. Two more states have ratified the amendment and now activists are arguing that the deadline set by Congress in the 70s is invalid, since the Constitution doesn’t give Congress that power. Tuesday’s hearing was focused on this question: If a 38th state ratifies the ERA, what can and should happen next?
“A few years ago, a great woman, a great person, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was asked in an interview what amendment she would most like to see added to the United States Constitution,” said Rep. Stephen Cohen, D-Tenn., during his opening remarks at Tuesday’s hearing. “She answered it would be the Equal Rights Amendment.”
But while conservative activists’ efforts have largely flown under the radar, it’s safe to say they have pulled out all the stops in their fight to keep the ERA out of the Constitution, and in fact to roll back existing protections against sex discrimination that progressives have already secured.
One flank of the attack is focused on the states. A number of state legislatures are looking at the possibility of becoming the 38th (and deciding) state to ratify the ERA, and in every case legislators are being swarmed by right-wing activists who don’t hesitate to use deceit and hysteria to stop this from happening.
In April in Missouri, anti-feminist activists leaned heavily on Republican legislators, using the scare word “abortion” in order to stoke opposition to equal rights. And sure enough, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Dave Schatz, came out against the ERA, saying that the “majority of this [amendment] is about abortion” and claiming that Jesus would oppose it. (Jesus’ known positions on issues of human equality would suggest otherwise.)
Virginia came within a hair of ratifying the ERA, but because the 2017 state elections were so close that the Republicans literally held their legislative majority by a coin toss, the ratification was killed. Once again, anti-abortion hysterics played a major role in the fight, with conservatives falsely accusing Democrats of wanting to legalize infanticide, all as part of a sexist campaign to demonize any effort to secure equality for women.
Even during Tuesday’s federal congressional hearing, Republicans were at it again. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., warned that “the people’s right to protect the unborn would be eliminated if the ERA was to pass,” and argued that women’s equality should not be enshrined in the Constitution lest it damage the ability of conservatives to meddle in women’s medical care access.
But, as Kamala Lopez of Equal Means Equal and legal expert Wendy Murphy told Salon, the legislative fights are only part of the picture. They expressed concern about a series of cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear that are billed as LGBTQ cases in the media, but, legally speaking, are also about the issue of sex discrimination.
The three cases, which will be bundled into one before the Supreme Court, all involve LGBTQ workers being fired for their identity. In two cases, the workers were fired for being gay and in the third, a woman was fired for being trans. The court is expected to examine whether or not these firings constitute sex discrimination that violates both state laws and the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The pro-LGBTQ side is arguing that this case is covered by a precedent set in 1988, when the Supreme Court decided it was a form of illegal sex discrimination to penalize employees for failing to perform their gender in a way that pleases their bosses. In that case, a woman was able to successfully argue that her employer had discriminated against her by denying her a promotion unless she learned to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.” Forcing employees to conform to gender stereotypes, the court decided, was in itself a form of sex discrimination.
LGBTQ advocates argue that if employers expect employees to be straight, or to adhere to a gender identity assigned at birth, that is a form of gender stereotyping that should, under this precedent, be illegal. Many feminist legal experts worry that if the court rules against the LGBTQ employees in these cases, it will not only set back LGBTQ rights but will also make it easier to discriminate against women on a much larger scale.
“These cases are designed to strike at the very heart of the law’s understanding of what it means to discriminate against someone because of their sex or their gender,” Imani Gandy, a legal expert at Rewire, explained in a recent “Boom! Lawyered” podcast. She goes on to note that a hostile decision in this case could lead to “firing a gay man for not being sufficiently ‘macho'” or to employers paying women less “because of a belief that men should be the heads of households.”
(Full disclosure: My partner, Marc Faletti, is executive producer of the “Boom! Lawyered” podcast.)
As Murphy explained in a follow-up email to Salon, she believes part of the reason the Supreme Court is taking the case now is part of a conservative divide-and-conquer strategy. Unfortunately, some feminist organizations have been reluctant to back a robust definition of “sex discrimination” that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. So these cases create an opportunity to chip away at progressive solidarity between these causes and weaken the movement against sex discrimination overall.
Whether in the courts or the legislatures, the right is pursuing an elaborate strategy to attack women’s equality and preserve sex discrimination by coming at the issue sideways. Instead of flatly admitting to opposing women’s legal equality, conservatives are hiding behind more provocative or “controversial” issues such as abortion rights or trans rights, which are less politically popular than the ERA, as a way of derailing efforts to fight sex discrimination.
Conservatives also know they have to move fast. Support for both abortion rights and LGBTQ equality are rising, making it harder to exploit the controversies around both to undermine women’s equality.

"Few could have anticipated that the historic release of the first image of a black hole would devolve into a public spectacle of sexist outrage — though such are the times we live in, in which literally every news item is picked apart by reactionaries.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/how-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole-turned-into-a-lesson-on-sexism-in-stem/,alternet,gender,left,78.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"This article originally appeared at Salon.
On April 10, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) presented the first-ever direct image of a black hole. The blurry composite embodied over two centuries of advances in mathematics, science and electronics. Prior to the image, only artistic illustrations were available to depict the mysterious singularities that warp the spacetime continuum by virtue of their huge masses, producing such gravitational force that not even light can escape. Shortly after the EHT presentation, MIT tweeted an image of Katie Bouman, a 29-year-old computer scientist whose work was crucial to the project, during the moment the first black hole was processed.
“Here’s the moment when the first black hole image was processed, from the eyes of researcher Katie Bouman,” MIT’s largest research lab, the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab, said on Twitter.
Bouman, a postdoctoral fellow with the Event Horizon Telescope and a forthcoming Assistant Professor in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at the California Institute of Technology, looked ecstatic in the photograph sitting in front of her computer, her hands covering her mouth in awe. The photograph instantly made her the face of the project — which is why an informal coterie of sexist trolls kicked off a sexist investigation to invalidate her contributions.
A familiar story arc followed. Fake Twitter accounts were set up in her name. Men on Twitter dismissed her scientific contributions as mere feminist posturing. And there was a debate over whether or not she was worthy of a Wikipedia page.
It is hard to imagine the same response would have followed if a white man was in that picture instead of Bouman. Salon reached out to Bouman for an interview, but a representative for MIT said she was no longer taking interviews with the press.
It is no secret that women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. According to 2016 statistics, women represent only 30 percent of the STEM workforce. Often their contributions go unnoticed, as history has shown us. For example, when people think about the mission that brought Apollo to the moon they most likely think of astronaut Neil Armstrong, not, say, Margaret Hamilton, who developed the on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. Placing Bouman at the center of the discovery may have been a conscious optics choice for the MIT research lab, given how STEM fields are often criticized for a lack of gender equality, but the public backlash was almost certainly unanticipated.
Amid the chaos, Bouman wrote in a Facebook post: “No one algorithm or person made this image, it required the amazing talent of a team of scientists from around the globe and years of hard work to develop the instrument, data processing, imaging methods, and analysis techniques that were necessary to pull off this seemingly impossible feat. It has been truly an honor, and I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to work with you all.”
Her response was gracious, and emphasized how big scientific projects happen through collective collaboration. As many have pointed out, her response brings to light the false glorification of the “lone genius” trope in STEM, in which one person is responsible for an ingenious creation. (Even Isaac Newton was famously was uncomfortable with the way he was treated as a singular hero for contemplating gravitation; “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” he wrote in a letter to fellow natural philosopher Robert Hooke.) Over 200 people worked on the black hole imaging project, and Bouman bringing this to the attention of the public was not an attempt to deflect her credibility or contributions, but to rather remind people that something this monumental in the science world can’t happen without a lot of brains. As Bouman described in her 2016 TED Talk, she likened herself to a forensic sketch artist, but instead she created an algorithm to image a mystery in the universe.
Yet the worst thing about this entire saga is that it may instill fear in young women who want to pursue a career in STEM. The message from the Bouman backlash is that if you are a woman who becomes the face of a massive scientific breakthrough, sexist internet trolls will spend way too much of their time harassing you and trying to disprove your credibility.
Women often face harassment on various social media platforms — especially in professions like journalism and politics, where they are in the public eye. How we move forward is unclear, as such abusive incidents are apt to inspire many to cease using social media platforms entirely, à la Kelly Marie Tran.","['devolve', 'sexist', 'outrage', 'reactionaries']"
"his is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/trumps-refusal-to-wear-a-mask-isnt-just-vanity-its-a-manifestation-of-his-fascism/,alternet,coronavirus,left,78.0,2.0,Biased,No agreement,"Despite knowing full well the furor that Vice President Mike Pence raised by not wearing a mask during a Mayo Clinic visit in late April, Donald Trump refused to wear a mask when visiting Honeywell factory in Arizona earlier this week — a factory that makes masks. This wasn’t just a symbolic nose-thumbing at people’s reasonable desire to be safe. Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were putting the lives of Honeywell employees in danger.
After all, masks are not primarily meant to protect the mask-wearer, but to protect others, since there’s clear evidence that people who are infected but have no symptoms can spread the coronavirus. Trump is regularly exposed to the virus, in fact — one of his personal valets just tested positive — and is a prime candidate to be such a carrier.
Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.”
“The president said doing so would make it seem like he is preoccupied with health instead of focused on reopening the nation’s economy,” the AP reporters write.
This is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear. But there’s also good reason to believe that the Trump-Pence antipathy to wearing masks signals to something deeper and darker.
Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths. Fox News host Laura Ingraham, in her friendly competition with fellow host Tucker Carlson to see who can be the most obnoxious, has started to demonize mask-wearing by claiming that public health advisories are somehow a conspiracy to sow “fear and intimidation.”
(Considering that mask-wearing to protect others took off in Asia long before Trump even ran for president, Ingraham’s conspiracy theory doesn’t possess even the most remote logical consistency.)
Between Trump and Fox News, the practice of mask-wearing is swiftly becoming another culture-war flashpoint. But the question is why. After all, masks seem to make people feel more comfortable with going out in public and going to work, and those are both things Trump dearly wants Americans to return to doing.
But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation. (Many have noted that this same argument could be made against the practice of wearing pants.)
Ultimately, the rejection of mask-wearing really goes back to the fact that Trump, Ingraham and their most faithful followers are guided by fascist impulse, even when they don’t or can’t articulate a fully fleshed-out fascist ideology. Above all other things, the fascist personality is one that rejects even the possibility of sickness. To wear a mask is to publicly admit that one’s body is suspectible to illness, which is coded as “weak” and therefore unacceptable.
Natascha Strobl, an Austrian political scientist who is an expert in far-right organizing and rhetoric, had an important English-language Twitter thread in early April about why the far right was embracing the view that the coronavirus should simply be allowed to run wild. From the beginning, this has been the view Trump clearly prefers on an emotional level and has pushed federal policy toward all along. While Strobl didn’t mention masks, her observations also help explain why these same folks are repulsed by mask-wearing.
The fascist narrative, Strobl explained, is that “men aren’t men anymore, but nervous, urban, overly intellectualized and (here it comes) sickly weaklings.
“Weakness is never worthy of protection and has to be cast out. This is fascism,” she continues. The fascist believes that those viewed as “weak” have an obligation to die “without protest for the greater good” and that if “they don’t do it, they are weak and the weak drag everyone else down and therefore must be done away with.”
To wear a mask, in other words, indicates a belief that your personal body can become infected. A fascist-minded person like Trump cannot admit such a thing, either because he genuinely believes he is too strong to be affected by the virus or because he fears looking weak in public. Just as important, wearing a mask indicates care and concern for others, especially those who are high-risk. But the fascist-minded person doesn’t want to protect those viewed as “weak” — in fact, those people are expected to die so as not to be a burden on others. As Strobl points out, the far right believes that by becoming seriously ill or dying in service to some warped conception of the greater good, the “weak” can prove themselves strong through their sacrifice.
Trump hasn’t exactly concealed his impulse to see the coronavirus as a force that culls the herd of its weakest members, or to perceive that the “weak” can be redeemed through this morbid, sadistic ritual sacrifice. This week, he repeatedly insisted that Americans should think of themselves as “warriors” who bravely go forth and face the virus for the cause of, well, his re-election, which he is convinced depends on reopening the economy without bothering with the testing protocols, contact tracing and other precautions that could make doing so both safe and feasible.
(Even if people are willing to die for a noble cause, it’s worth pausing here and observing gently that Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is not such a cause.)
Moreover, Trump has always made a point of presenting himself as the fascist version of the Übermensch, even as he is likely too dim to know that word or what it signifies. Trump is forever bragging about his alleged “good genes,” which he often invokes as being so powerful as to render him a genius-level expert in any number of subjects, from medicine to economics to military strategy, without any need to do anything as weak and effeminate as learning stuff. Wearing a mask would go against his effort to present himself as possessing near-supernatural genetic powers to repel the sorts of viruses with which mere mortals must contend.
Of course, Trump doesn’t actually believe his own lies on this subject (nor on many others). As NBC News has reported, when Trump found out that a White House valet had the coronavirus, he became “lava level mad” at his staff and accused them of not doing enough to protect him. His public bravado is, as with all things Trump, a thin mask plastered over a deep well of insecurity. He may want you to believe his immune system is superhuman, but he knows full well that his obese and shattered 73-year-old physique puts him in the category of the high-risk people he and his fellow Republicans are treating as weaklings better off culled from the herd.
Unfortunately, because face masks have become such a potent symbol to far-right culture warriors of values they reject, such as equality and compassion, we can only expect the symbolic clash over masks to escalate. More and more conservatives, especially men, will try to prove their superior masculine strength and power by refusing to wear them. This is childish, selfish and entirely counterproductive, of course. What else can we expect from Trump and his followers, who are the real weaklings in this unhappy social equation?","['false', 'dichotomy']"

ISIS (Islamic State, Iraq and Syria) is among the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world; they’re so violent that even al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been critical of their methods.

And as the death toll continues to soar, it is painfully obvious that the Christian Right and white nationalists are doing a lot more to kill Americans than ISIS and other radical Islamists.
Islamist terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda encourage suicide bombing, which — as countless anti-terror Muslims will point out — is an insult to Islam because the Qu’ran is very anti-suicide.

And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples.
Item: In mid-march in Tampa, Florida, Pastor Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church Vowed to defy social distancing and told a crowd, “I’ve got news for you: this church will never close.” And he was arrested two weeks later.
Item: in Louisiana, Rev. Tony Spell of the fundamentalist Life Tabernacle Church was arrested in late March for continuing to hold large gatherings with up to 1000 people.
Item: televangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth rushed to Howard-Browne’s defense, denouncing pastors who promoted social distancing as “losers” and asserted, “If you’re putting out pamphlets and telling everybody to use Purell before they come into the sanctuary…. you should just turn in your ministry credentials and burn your church down. You’re a loser. Bunch of pansies. No balls. Got neutered somewhere along the line and don’t even realize it.” And Shuttlesworth vowed to hold a packed Easter service in defiance of social distancing.
Of course, extremists like Howard-Browne and Shuttlesworth don’t represent Christianity on the whole. Countless Catholic and non-fundamentalist Mainline Protestant churches have, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, discontinued in-person gatherings and held online services instead. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement.
Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But the figures reported by researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore underscore just how deadly the pandemic is: according to Hopkins, more than 147,300 people had died from coronavirus worldwide as of early Friday morning, April 17. And the coronavirus epicenter is now the U.S, for which Hopkins has reported a death troll of more than 33,200 — which is artificially low because less than 1% of Americans have been tested for COVID-19.
The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency.
Coronavirus truthers refuse to believe media accounts of just how overwhelmed U.S. hospitals have been du ring the pandemic. And in a pathetic attempt to “disprove” media reports, they have been promoting the #FilmYourHospital hashtag and filming hospital parking lots. But if they actually went inside those hospitals as real journalists have been doing, the truthers would see for themselves just how overwhelmed doctors and nurses have been.
But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC.
As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult.","['far-right', 'encouraging']"

And until white Americans and the media they control acknowledge that simple history, we won’t be able to do the things we must to change it.
While we need rational gun control, this isn’t a gun control issue.
While we need economic security to be more widely shared, this isn’t an economic issue.
While we need universal, free, high-quality K-PhD education, this isn’t an education issue.
While the Republican Party needs to repudiate the “Southern Strategy” that has animated their racist base since 1968, this isn’t a political issue.
Encompassing all of the above, what we are confronting in America right now is the continuation of policies put into place by white people, to control and exploit Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, since the arrival of Africans in 1619 and the codification of slavery into North American law in 1662.
The institution of slavery can only exist in a police state. Without a constantly vigilant and well-armed force of men (and the rare, occasional woman) patrolling the towns and roads, slaves will rebel and put an end to their own enslavement.
As Sally Hadden notes in her brilliant book Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas, slaveholding regions had institutionalized police-patrol systems specifically to “regulate” enslaved persons more than 100 years before American independence.
In Georgia, for example, a generation before the American Revolution, the colonial government passed laws in 1755 and 1757 that required all plantation owners or their white male employees to be members of the Georgia militia and those armed militia members to make monthly inspections of the quarters of all slaves in the state. The law defined which counties had which armed militias and even required armed militia members to keep a keen eye out for slaves who might be planning uprisings.
As Carl T. Bogus wrote for the University of California Davis Law Review in 1998, “The Georgia statutes required patrols, under the direction of commissioned militia officers, to examine every plantation each month and authorized them to search ‘all Negro Houses for offensive Weapons and Ammunition’ and to apprehend and give twenty lashes to any slave found outside plantation grounds.”
James Madison even rewrote the Second Amendment into its current form during the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention in response to that state’s largest slaveholder, Patrick Henry, demanding that Virginia’s slave patrols be explicitly protected.
While slavery as an institution was abolished after the Civil War by the 13th Amendment (“except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted”), the organized and systematic domination of people of color for the benefit of whites continues to this day. And the enforcers of that system—both formal and informal—are still very much with us.
State prisons legally enslaving “duly convicted” persons of color; Klan riders and lynching “parties”; cops killing black men for selling loose cigarettes or murdering black children for playing with toy guns; mass shooters raving about “invasion” by Hispanics; white men enforcing segregation by killing black men and boys who look at or date white women: These are the modern incarnations of the old slave patrols that most Americans recognize.
Less easily recognized is the patrolling of America’s economic racial divide, from Trump employees marking “C” for “colored” on rental applications so people of color could be denied residence, to the rigorous application of property tax funding for schools to keep poor districts poor, millions of individual corporate actions and thousands of state and local laws still conspire to “patrol” people of color.
Like his presidential hero Andrew Jackson (nickname: “Indian Killer”), who owned enslaved people and bragged about murdering Native American women and children, Donald Trump speaks to an exclusively white audience, in this era via Twitter and a TV network that, judging from the ratings, programs exclusively to white people.
From “very fine people” who are literally Nazis and white supremacists, to “I’ll pay for your lawyer” calls for violence, to barely speaking in code with words like “invasion” and “infestation,” Trump has cranked up a new generation of white men who, in previous centuries on this continent, would have been enthusiastic members of the police state that protected slavery from rebellion.
The slave patrols never really went away. And the slave patrollers are finding in Trump the president they’ve been missing since Andrew Jackson passed away.

“Melania and I join all Americans in praying for the continued healing of those in the Parkland community and all communities where lives have been lost to gun violence.”
The White House issued a statement this morning on the anniversary of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. It was a fairly long statement issued on behalf of the president, who touted the “tremendous strides” he believes his administration has made, and who made exactly one direct reference to guns:
As the Washington Post noted, Donald Trump soon after published a tweet on the same subject, which was nearly identical, though it made one important change:
“Melania and I join all Americans in praying for the continued strength and healing of those in the Parkland community and all communities where there has been the loss of life as a result of school violence.”
Careful readers will note “praying for the continued healing,” became “praying for the continued strength and healing,” and “where lives have been lost” became “where there has been the loss of life.” These were minor and inconsequential edits.
But note the last two words in each statement: Trump’s original statement referred to “gun violence,” which soon after became “school violence.”
For some on the right, all references to massacres such as these are supposed to avoid phrases such as “mass shooting” and “gun violence,” because the rhetoric, according to the right, might imply there’s something wrong with guns. We’re apparently supposed to examine violent acts by turning our attention to the perpetrator, rather than the mechanism used by the perpetrator.
Maybe it’s just a coincidence that the Republican president altered his own statement in a way that satisfies conservatives’ rhetorical expectations, but it’s hardly a stretch to wonder if the West Wing received a “reminder” about the kind of language the president’s base expects him to use.
Meanwhile, on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, House Democrats are moving in a different direction. The Associated Press reported:
A key House committee approved a bill Wednesday to require background checks for all sales and transfers of firearms, a first step by majority Democrats to tighten gun laws after eight years of Republican rule. The House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of the bill 23-15, sending it to the House floor. If approved by the full House, the bill would be the most significant gun-control legislation approved by either chamber of Congress in at least a decade.
As Rachel noted on the show last night, this was the first time in over a decade a major bill to address gun violence passed a congressional committee.","['massacres', 'rhetoric']"
"The Republicans’ corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-says-american-worker-top-priority-economists-are-skeptical-n1119386?cid=public-rss_20200121,msnbc,middle-class,left,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
President Donald Trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in Davos on Tuesday to make the case that ordinary Americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration’s “America first” maxim.
At the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, Trump argued that a regime of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class.
“Every decision we make on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday Americans,” Trump said, adding that “the well-being of the American worker” was paramount.
On CNBC, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow echoed the president’s assertions. “Inequality is diminishing right now,” he said. “I think we’re in a better place.”
Many mainstream economists hold a different opinion. While low unemployment and steadily — if slowly — rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower-income Americans, these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few.
“The economic backdrop is such that people’s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement… “It’s debatable what all of that’s attributable to,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha
In spite of higher incomes, significant wealth-building among the middle class has not manifested, McBride pointed out. “More people are working, more people are making money. The extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security, such as boosting emergency savings, retirement savings or paying down debt, is still unclear,” he said.
The Republicans’ corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
“The Tax Policy Center says that two-thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution, with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains,” he said.
“I don’t particularly feel that it’s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape,” said Scott Cole, founder and president of Cole Financial Planning and Wealth Management.
Economists point out that Trump’s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit, a growth-sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing, even as the stock market has notched record highs.
“There’s no way that what’s happening right now under a Republican administration is fiscal conservatism,” Cole said.
In his Davos speech, Trump revisited another favorite topic, negative interest rates. “They get paid to borrow money, something I could get used to very quickly. Love that,” he said.
In reality, negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary Americans, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics.
“We know that they also destroy household savings and long-term retirement security,” she said. “It’s a move that supports stock markets, not personal savings.”
And to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual, a large number of households have still been left behind, McBride said. “We’ve seen scant evidence that Americans, en masse, have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security,” he said.
“Regardless of what the headline is… I would think it’s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you’re not participating in it,” Cole said.","['economic', 'inequality', 'magnified']"
But our new research disproves the admittedly tempting idea that merely putting a woman in power improves gender equality. ,https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/female-presidents-dont-always-help-women-while-in-office-report/,alternet,gender,left,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"When Michelle Bachelet steps down as Chile’s president on March 11, she will bring to a close not just her own administration but also an era of female leadership in Latin America.
Between 2006 and 2018, four women served as presidents in the region. On the political left, Bachelet and Argentina’s Cristina Fernández both completed two terms. Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, of the progressive Workers’ Party, was impeached a year into her second administration. And, on the center-right, Laura Chinchilla governed Costa Rica from 2011 to 2014.
For gender researchers like ourselves, this is a rare chance to assess how the president’s gender influences policy in Latin American countries. Global research has confirmed that having women in the highest echelons of power leads to greater political engagement among women and girls. We wanted to know what Latin America’s four “presidentas” had done to promote gender equality while in power.
Here’s what we learned.
Reproductive rights not guaranteed
Prior studies had already shown that Latin America’s presidentas nominated more female cabinet ministers, paving the way for future generations of female leaders.
And based on public opinion survey data, we knew that in Latin American countries with female heads of state, women were slightly more likely to participate in local politics than in countries run by men. Latin Americans who have a woman for president are also much less likely than other respondents to say they think men make better political leaders than women.
But our new research disproves the admittedly tempting idea that merely putting a woman in power improves gender equality. Other factors, including party politics and the presence of strong social movements, turn out to exert more influence on a president’s policies.
Take abortion, for example, which is largely outlawed in heavily CatholicLatin America. Even in the few countries, like Costa Rica, that allow women to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape, the procedure is still extremely difficult to obtain. Fully 97 percent of Latin American women cannot get safe, legal abortions, leading to high rates of maternal mortality.
But attempts to ease Latin American abortion laws have historically provoked a deep conservative backlash. In Brazil, Rousseff declared her support for abortion liberalization on the campaign trail in 2010, but had to backpedal due to intense media criticism. Once in office, Rousseff remained silent on reproductive rights.
Bachelet also shied away from the issue during her first term. The Catholic opposition was well organized and, at the time, Chile’s feminist movement was relatively weak. Bachelet focused instead on access to emergency contraception.
By the time she ran for re-election in 2013, however, feminists had coalesced around abortion reform. They pushed Bachelet to include reproductive rights in her campaign and kept the pressure on once she was in office. In 2017 Chile made abortion legal in cases of rape, fetal deformity or danger to a mother’s life.
In Argentina, meanwhile, Fernández – also a leftist – actually quashed activists’ efforts to expand reproductive rights. Perhaps unsurprisingly, so did the conservative Laura Chinchilla in Costa Rica.
Gender equality lags under populists
That’s because major social change requires more than just a woman president. The kind of political party she leads matters a lot – more, in fact, than her gender.
The left-wing populist parties that ruled Ecuador, Argentina and Venezuela during the period we analyzed made no effort to liberalize abortions. In fact, we found that populist leaders, in their quest to appeal to the masses, actively shut out feminist activists and ignored the demands of female constituents.
Fernández didn’t just uphold Argentina’s harsh abortion restrictions – she actually cut off funding for the country’s universal contraception program, too. Rather than focus on women’s issues, her Justicialist Party expanded social welfare programs, including a hallmark cash-transfer program that subsidizes families with young children.
Anti-poverty policies are typical of the populist Peronist movement that brought Fernández and her husband, former president Nestor Kirchner, into power. These initiatives may also help women, since they are poorer than men, but that’s not the main goal.
In the Latin American countries we studied, those where reproductive rights most improved in the early 21st century were ruled by what political scientists call “institutionalized parties.” Such parties generally have a cogent ideology – though it could be left, right or center – a broad base of support and clear structures for responding to constituent demands.
When Bachelet finally loosened abortion restrictions, it was at the helm of a broad-based coalition called the New Majority. Likewise, Uruguay fully legalized abortion in 2012 under the presidency of José Mujica and his Broad Front alliance.
Men help women, too
Legalizing abortion – one of the world’s most polarizing policy debates – may be asking a lot. So we also assessed whether these four presidentas promoted gender equality in other ways.
We found they did somewhat better on childcare, which enables women to return to the labor market after becoming mothers. Argentina’s Fernández paid the topic little mind, but Bachelet, Rousseff and even Costa Rica’s center-rightist Chinchilla all expanded access to childcare during their tenures.
But so did the men who governed Uruguay during the same period. That supports the idea that party type matters more than the chief executive’s gender when it comes to a country’s women’s rights.
And when looking at perhaps the most dramatic improvement in gender equality in Latin American in recent years – the high number of women in politics – we see that these changes, too, were led by male and female politicians alike.
Improvements began in the early 1990s. Back then, nearly every Latin American country adopted some form of gender quota, which requires political parties to nominate a certain percentage of women for legislative office. In many cases, though, the early laws were rather weak. Parties put women on the ballot in districts they could never win or didn’t get fully behind their campaigns.
Over the past decade, women politicians and feminists across the region have organized to improve political participation among women. In every country where women pushed stronger gender quotas through Congress, those initiatives became law.
The payoff of this popular women’s mobilization has been huge: Between 1990 and 2018, the percentage of female lawmakers in Latin America shot up, from 9 percent to 28 percent.","['admittedly', 'tempting']"
"Today, the cumulative stress of Donald Trump’s escalating trade war is leading to if not an irreparable breach between America and China, then certainly a significant fraying.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/trump-is-incapable-of-fixing-relations-with-china-and-his-trade-war-is-likely-to-grow-more-destructive/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,79.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"“Chimerica” is a term originally coined by the historian Niall Ferguson and economist Moritz Schularick to describe the growing economic relationship between the U.S. and China since the latter’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. In the words of Ferguson: “The Chinese did the saving, the Americans the spending. The Chinese did the exporting, the Americans the importing. The Chinese did the lending, the Americans the borrowing.” Much of the pre-crisis boom in global trade was driven by this economic symbiosis, which is why successive American presidents tolerated this marriage of convenience despite the increasing costs to the U.S. economy. The net benefits calculation, however, began to change after 2008, and the conflict has intensified further after the 2016 presidential election result. Today, the cumulative stress of Donald Trump’s escalating trade war is leading to if not an irreparable breach between the two countries, then certainly a significant fraying. The imminent resumption of trade talks notwithstanding, the rising cost of the tariffs is already inducing some U.S. manufacturers to exit China. But in most instances, they are not returning to home shores.
It may have taken Trump to point out the pitfalls of the Chimerica link, but coming up with a coherent strategy to replace it is clearly beyond the president’s abilities. America is likely to remain a relative manufacturing wasteland, as barren as Trump’s own ill-conceived ideas on trade. At the same time, it’s not going to be an unmitigated victory for China either, as Beijing is increasingly suffering from a large confluence of internal and external pressures.
Chimerica helped to launch China as a global trade power. To the extent that this marriage helped the U.S. economy, it skewed toward the largely blue state coastal regions. Wall Street banks located on the East Coast happily collected lucrative commissions and investment banking fees, as China’s export proceeds were recycled into U.S. treasuries, stocks, and high-end real estate while the capital markets boomed; on the West Coast, “new economy” companies thrived, their growth and profitability unhindered by the onslaught of Chinese manufactured exports. By contrast, facilitated by technological advances that permitted large-scale outsourcing by U.S. manufacturers, Chimerica laid waste to much of what was left of America’s Rust Belt, and the politics of many of the displaced workers mutated to the extent that Donald Trump became an appealing alternative to the establishment in 2016.
The major legacy of Chimerica, then, is that too many American workers have been semi-permanently replaced by low-cost offshored labor. Prior to great advances in technology, along with globalization, displacement of the current labor force could only have occurred through immigration of workers into the country. Historically, displacement by immigrants generally began at the menial level of the labor force, and became more restrictive as when it became correlated with significant unemployment. Given the rise of globalization and the corresponding liberalization of immigration in the past few decades, however, policy no longer arrests the displacement of American workers. The policy backlash has consequently manifested itself more via trade protectionism. Trump has sought to consolidate his Rust Belt base of supporters by launching a trade war, especially versus Beijing, the ultimate effects of which he hoped would be to re-domicile supply chains that had earlier migrated to China.
Early on in his presidency, there was some hope that Trump’s protectionism was at best a bluff or, at worst, an aberration, and that the return of a Democrat to the White House in 2020 would eventually reestablish the status quo ante. But the president still can’t get a wall, and his protectionism has become more pronounced almost as if to compensate. The problem today is that even if Trump is voted out of office in 2020, corporate America is becoming less inclined to wait out the end of his presidency to return to the pre-Trump status quo of parking the bulk of their manufacturing in China. There is too much risk in putting all of one’s eggs in the China basket, especially given growing national security concerns. Hence, U.S. companies are taking action. In spite of decades of investment in these China-domiciled supply chains, a number of American companies are pulling out: toy manufacturer Hasbro, Illinois-based phone accessories manufacturer Xentris Wireless, and lifestyle clothing company PacSun are a few of the operators who are exiting the country.
But they are not coming back to the U.S., relocating instead to places like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mexico, the Philippines and Taiwan. The chief financial officer of Xentris, Ben Buttolph, says that the company will never return to China: “We are trying to have multiple locations certified for all of our products, so that if all of a sudden there’s an issue with one of the locations, we just flip the switch.” Likewise, the CEO of Hasbro, Brian Goldner, recently spoke of “great opportunities in Vietnam, India and other territories like Mexico.”
All is not lost for the U.S., however, as Goldner did celebrate the success of Hasbro’s facility in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, which has resumed production of Play-Doh in the U.S. for the first time since 2004. It is doubtful, however, that this represents the recapturing of the high value-added supply chains that Trump envisaged when he first launched his trade assault on Beijing.
In general, as Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, writes: “United States industry is losing ground to foreign competitors on price, quality and technology. In many areas, our manufacturing capacity cannot compete with what exists in Asia.”
These are not isolated examples. Defense One also notes the following development:
“It came without a breaking news alert or presidential tweet, but the technological competition with China entered a new phase last month. Several developments quietly heralded this shift: Cross-border investments between the United States and China plunged to their lowest levels since 2014, with the tech sector suffering the most precipitous drop. U.S. chip giants Intel and AMD abruptly ended or declined to extend important partnerships with Chinese entities. The Department of Commerce halved the number of licenses that let U.S. companies assign Chinese nationals to sensitive technology and engineering projects.”
This development consequently makes it hard to proclaim Beijing a winner in this dispute either. The country still needs access to U.S. high tech. The government announced yet another fiscal stimulus to the economy earlier this month in response to a cluster of weakening economic data, much of which is related to the trade shock. It is also the case that China is being buffeted politically, both externally and internally: externally, in addition to the escalating trade war, China’s own efforts to counter the effects of rising protectionism by creating a “reverse Marshall Plan” via the Belt and Road Initiative is floundering. China’s “iron brother,” Pakistan, is increasingly being victimized by India’s aggressive Hindu-centric nationalism. It is hard to imagine the Modi government opportunistically taking the step of annexing Kashmir and undermining Pakistan, had it not sensed Beijing’s increasing vulnerability.
Internally, Beijing is finding it increasingly challenging as it seeks to enforce its “One China” policy in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The withdrawal of the controversial extradition law that first precipitated widespread demonstrations in Hong Kong has not alleviated the political pressures in the territory, but simply allowed an even bigger protest culture to take root and strengthen an independent political mindset. Similarly, Taiwan has also openly supported the Hong Kong protesters, pledging help to those seeking asylum. Both regions now constitute both a huge humiliation and challenge to the primacy of China’s ruling Communist Party. And now on top of that, foreign manufacturers are leaving the country, weakening a totally leveraged manufacturing complex.
The implications of this divorce go well beyond the U.S. and China. They constitute another step toward regionalization, another step away from a quaint ideological “post-history” construct that saw Washington, D.C., as the head office and the rest of the world as a bunch of branch plants for “America, Inc.” It’s hardly comforting to contemplate that the last time we reached this historic juncture was the early 1900s, when a similarly globalized economy broke down, followed by the Great War. As Niall Ferguson points out, “a high level of economic integration does not necessarily prevent the growth of strategic rivalry and, ultimately, conflict.” There’s no doubt that both Washington and Beijing will likely make soothing noises to the markets in order to create favorable conditions for the trade talks in October, but their actions suggest that they are both digging in for a longer struggle. Today’s trade wars, therefore, are likely to morph into something more destructive, which is a lose-lose in an era where human advancement depends on greater integration between economic powers.

"Even after climton's loss in 2016, the network tried desperately to drag her back into the spotlight, to juice up its long-running narrative that she’s a an all-powerful force of marauding feminist evil, which viewers embrace with lust.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/fox-news-is-doing-to-ilhan-omar-and-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-exactly-what-it-did-to-hillary-clinton/,alternet,gender,left,79.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"For decades, Fox News’ programming has revolved around the need to identify and target Democratic demons, who are then used to frighten Republican viewers. And for most of the network’s existence, Hillary Clinton has served as a perennial rogue, depicted as a villainous, criminal scoundrel who can’t be trusted with America’s future. With Clinton now receding from public life, Fox News has seamlessly transferred its vile attacks onto a new generation of Democratic women, led by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
“Fox News needs an opponent, a detractor, an enemy to add conflict and edge to its broadcasts,” noted the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple. In other words, Fox is in the business of scripted entertainment—under the guise of “news”—and needs long-running characters that it can return to again and again. It crafts targets of hate who rile up viewers and keep them tuned in to the different storylines.
For Fox, Clinton, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez represent perfect targets in terms of riling up its intolerant base: Clinton is a woman of a certain age, while Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are women of a certain heritage. And yes, there’s something in the Fox News DNA over the years that has meant that women political opponents spark a deeper sense of outrage and hate. You could make an argument that during eight years in the White House, it was Michelle Obama who suffered sharper, more personal Fox News attacks than did her husband. It’s all part of an endless, dehumanizing campaign to silence opponents, and specifically to silence and intimidate Democratic women.
This week, Fox News’ sister print outlet, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, published an incitement on the front page, which depicted the World Trade Towers bursting into flames and falsely claimed that Omar, who is Muslim, had belittled the Sept. 11 attack. The reckless pile-on has been relentless. Days earlier, Fox & Friendshost Brian Kilmeade questioned Omar’s loyalty, saying, “You have to wonder if she is an American first.” Over at Fox Business News, Lou Dobbs claimed, “She sounds like she hates America.” Those comments echoed those made by another Fox host, Jeanine Pirro, who suggested, “Omar wears a hijab. … Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?”
Pirro was actually suspended from hosting her Saturday night show for two weeks because of her tawdry attack on Omar. But her suspension has obviously done nothing to curtail the mindless, racist attacks on the Democratic congresswoman. All this has happened while threats against Omar’s life continue to escalate.
To date, Fox News’ obsession with Ocasio-Cortez, for the most part, hasn’t been as overtly dangerous as its smear campaign against Omar, but the negative attention has been unending.","['feminist', 'evil', 'lust', 'marauding']"
"While a number of transgender advocates and LGBTQ health experts applauded P&G’s decision to redesign the Always packaging by removing the female signs, the company’s announcement sparked criticism online, including a bounty of transphobic commentary.",https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/always-remove-female-symbol-sanitary-products-packaging-n1069721,msnbc,gender,left,79.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Always announced it will remove the Venus symbol from its menstruation products packaging following calls by transgender advocates, who said its parent, Procter & Gamble, was alienating trans and gender-nonconforming customers by not acknowledging that they, too, can experience menstruation.
“Could someone from Always tell me why it is imperative to have the female symbol on their sanitary products?” Twitter user Melly Bloom, one of those advocates, tweeted over the summer. “There are non-binary and trans folks who still need to use your products too you know!”
The company announced it would be removing the female signs from its packaging starting in December and aims to have a new design distributed worldwide by February 2020.
“For over 35 years, Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so. We’re also committed to diversity and inclusion and are on a continual journey to understand the needs of all of our consumers,” Proctor & Gamble's media relations team told NBC News in an email Monday. “We routinely assess our products, packaging and designs, taking into account consumer feedback, to ensure we are meeting the needs of everyone who uses our products. The change to our pad wrapper design is consistent with that practice.”
LGBTQ health experts said the decision is an ostensibly small change that may have significant consequences for trans and nonbinary people.
“This is a great move,” Dr. Jack Turban, a resident physician in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said in an email. “First of all, the symbol is unnecessary. Second of all, it sends a message to transgender and non-binary people who need these products that their identities are embraced and supported by the company,”
The Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. This site is protected by recaptcha
Steph deNormand, the Trans Health Program manager at Fenway Health, also championed the design adjustment, stating that seeing “female-coded” imagery can not only exacerbate gender dysphoria for trans and gender-nonconforming people, but can also prevent them from purchasing or accessing sanitary products.
“For folks using these products on a nearly monthly basis, it can be harmful and distressing to see binary/gendered images, coding, language and symbols. So, using less coded products can make a huge difference,” deNormand said. “Trans and nonbinary folks are constantly misgendered, and a gesture like this can broaden out the experiences and open up spaces for those who need the products.”
While a number of transgender advocates and LGBTQ health experts applauded P&G’s decision to redesign the Always packaging, the company’s announcement sparked criticism online, including a bounty of transphobic commentary.
The Daily Mail, which has a history of publishing anti-LGBTQ stories, accused P&G of “kowtowing” to the “transgender lobby” and reported that women in the United Kingdom are now boycotting the leading brand. The site also used a picture of teenage trans activist Ben Saunders to accompany its story. Saunders, like Bloom, was reportedly among those who had reached out to Always regarding its Venus symbol.

While some critics accused the company of trying to “erase women,” much of the criticism appears to be rooted in the misconception that transgender and nonbinary people cannot experience menstruation — a claim medical experts have debunked.
“Menstruation can occur for anyone with a uterus,” Turban wrote. “There are many medications that stop or lighten periods (used by both cisgender and transgender people), but these do not completely stop menstruation for all people.”
DeNormand also noted that not all trans and nonbinary people take hormones that can affect menstruation.
“While for a lot of people who take testosterone, the bleeding often decreases or goes away, for some it doesn’t,” deNormand explained. “And for others, taking hormones does not affirm their gender and is not the goal, so they may have a regular menstrual cycle.”
While some are now calling for a boycott of the brand, Turban said Always’ decision uplifts trans and gender-nonconforming people.
“The greatest predictor of good mental health among transgender and nonbinary people is feeling that they are accepted,” Turban said. “The company is showing that it accepts, respects, and cares about this population, which is a powerful statement for a community that is so often marginalized and rejected.”
Always’ announcement came right before the first National Period Day, which took place Oct. 19 — a day of protests elevating the issue of “period poverty” and demanding an end to taxes on tampons and pads.

"On one hand, it’s true that a female candidate would face an uphill battle against the ingrained sexism of the electorate, not to mention the vicious misogyny of Donald Trump.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/01/the-new-battle-over-sexism-hurts-both-warren-and-sanders-but-for-different-reasons/,alternet,gender,left,80.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Late on the day before the first Democratic primary debate of the year — and the last one before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 — CNN published a report saying that during a meeting early last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont had told Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his primary opponent and friend, that a woman couldn’t win the 2020 presidential election.
After many hours, Warren’s campaign released a terse statement noting that while it was true that Sanders had told her “he disagreed” with her belief that a female Democrat could win, she had no desire to discuss a “private meeting” because “Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry,” noting that the two progressive New England senators have long been “friends and allies”.
Sanders, for his part, claimed that “staff who weren’t in the room are lying about what happened” and characterized the conversation as one where he told Warren “that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could” and insisting that he does believe “a woman can win in 2020.”
On social media, accusations of lying flew wildly, and Warren supporters leaned heavily on the language of #MeToo and believing women — even though, to be absolutely clear, no one is accusing Sanders of doing anything untoward. But this not-quite-dispute was nonetheless being positioned as a “he said/she said” situation, where one of them had to be lying and the answer was determined by whom you happen to support.
But the truth is, as philosopher Kate Manne explained on Twitter, there’s a space where both interpretations of this conversation have legitimacy. On one hand, it’s true that a female candidate would face an uphill battle against the ingrained sexism of the electorate, not to mention the vicious misogyny of Donald Trump. So it makes sense that Sanders sees these comments merely as “telling it like it is,” even if one wonders why he seemed to feel that Warren needed telling, when she’s got a lifetime of direct experience.
On the other hand, it’s also true that men often use the “it’s not me, it’s the world” cover to discourage women’s dreams and ambitions, and often for self-serving reasons. Many women have had the experience of a man who, because he likes having someone else do the housework or because he feels his ego is threatened, “informs” a woman in his life that she must scale back her goals because of sexism — not his sexism, of course, but you know, someone else’s.
So it’s entirely possible that both things are true and no one is lying: Warren heard him say a woman couldn’t win this election, and Sanders felt he was just telling it like it is. This would also explain why Warren is insisting this is no big deal, as his comments were, at worst, a bit of self-serving mansplaining rather than a real effort to shoot down her campaign.
No doubt Tuesday night’s debate in Des Moines will help clarify these issues. In the meantime, it would do well for supporters of both candidates to dial down the conspiracy theorizing that’s going on right now. Despite some of my off-the-cuff speculation Monday night Twitter, in the cold light of day I think the ugly truth is that this story hurts both candidates, potentially quite badly.
For Sanders, the damage is obvious enough. Because Bernie has a flock of stalwart fans who are super-duper-don’t-bother-denying-it sexist, and who enjoy trolling and demonizing feminists online and then turning around and condescending to women in real life, plenty of feminists are suspicious that Sanders himself harbors some old-fashioned views about keeping that glass ceiling in place, even if he wouldn’t admit to them. Call it the pig-attracts-pig theory of politics, and this story is seen as justification for these fears.
I think this is an overblown fear. The truth is that a lot of people share the concerns that Sanders reportedly expressed in his meeting with Warren. I’ve had more women than men privately tell me that they think a woman can’t win this time around. More to the point, whether or not Sanders, like all liberal men and plenty of women, has stubborn prejudices lurking in his heart (though woe unto those who acknowledge it), what matters far more is that he has signed onto the feminist agenda and, if elected, would almost certainly promote policies meant to ensure women’s equality.
And while there are also plenty of Sanders stans distastefully proclaiming that Warren is a snake and a liar, in truth this story does nothing to help Warren, and if anything is likely to hurt her worse than it hurts Sanders. As Manne noted in her Twitter thread, “(even lightly) challenging a powerful white man’s moral judgment is among the ultimate bases for misogynist aggression.”
Writer Moira Donegan agreed, tweeting that “women get no rewards from complaining about sexism.”
One would hope, after #MeToo, that this lesson would have sunk in: Women fear speaking out at all, because while there’s no certainty that it will make any difference in male behavior, you can be absolutely certain that it will make your personal life a living hell from all the blowback you’re likely to receive. That’s true when the subject is as serious an issue as rape. When it’s something minor, like a bit of obnoxious but ultimately harmless mansplaining, the costs outweigh any potential benefit.
Hopefully, Sanders and Warren will be able to answer the inevitable questions about this during Tuesday’s debate in a way that allows for empathy and nuance, instead of flattening these two complicated and important progressive figures into caricatures of a lying woman and a piggish man.
What’s particularly galling about this is that the Warren v. Sanders narrative, by serving to undermine both of them, most clearly benefits former Vice President Joe Biden, who may well be able to slide in and yank the nomination from the wreckage. A few weeks ago, Biden made a similar statement in public to the one Sanders allegedly made in private, in a speech where he said that while Hillary Clinton faced sexism in 2016, “that’s not going to happen with me.” It would be particularly ironic if he were the one to benefit from all of this, although that might please the major donors and middle-road centrists who aren’t comfortable with either Sanders or Warren.
In the meantime, I hope that this can open up a larger discussion about how women are subtly discouraged, often by people who think of themselves as well-meaning, from having greater ambitions, and how that discouragement can help contribute to women’s inequality.
For instance, research shows the main reason that there are far fewer women holding public office than men is that fewer women run for office in the first place. This drip-drip-drip of “concerns” from people in your life telling you that a woman can’t make it gets into women’s heads and they quit before they’ve even tried. The worst part is that the “concerns” are overblown. Of course women face sexism when they run for office, but in the end, they are just as likely as men to win.
The reality is that if women wait until the public is “ready” for women to run for higher office, direct Hollywood films or otherwise grab for the kind of power men have typically hoarded for themselves, then women will wait forever. Sexism isn’t like the common cold, where if we just rest up and sip some chicken soup, it will pass in due time. Sexist attitudes are changed because people go out there and change them. The public will become ready to have women in power the same way they became ready for the first black president: Because someone runs for the office and wins. Warren, unlike Barack Obama, has the advantage of having someone who paved the way ahead of her. As Bernie Sanders reminded us in his response to all this, won nearly 3 million more votes than Donald Trump in 2016.
There’s a chance here to have a productive conversation about what’s really holding women back and how to fight it. It just requires everyone to simmer down a bit. Sanders fans need to admit that their man, being human, could have said something blinkered and self-serving. Warren fans need to admit that whatever Sanders’ blind spots and graceless comments may be, he’s got a long track record of support for feminist policies. And everyone needs to admit they can vote for their preferred candidate without proclaiming that every other candidates is the devil.","['ingrained', 'vicious', 'misogyny']"

"For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/bunker-boy-trump-thinks-he-can-edit-reality-like-tv-show/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,80.0,2.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Whatever the specifics of what Donald Trump’s diagnosis may be, from the moment protesters started to hit the streets to denounce police brutality, one thing was certain: The president’s brainworms would direct his energies away from doing anything useful and toward the task of managing his ego, relying on the reality TV tricks he mistakes for the real work of presidenting.
And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['lazy', 'narcissist', 'idiot']"

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — President Donald Trump accused Democrats of “politicizing” the deadly coronavirus during a campaign rally here on Friday, claiming that the outbreak is “their new hoax” as he continued to downplay the risk in the U.S.
“Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,” Trump said. “They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.”
“This is their new hoax,” Trump continued, adding that attacking the White House’s response to the coronavirus had become the Democratic Party’s “single talking point.”
Trump has weaponized the word “hoax” throughout his presidency, using it to belittle and discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference as well as his impeachment trial. He also has a long history of distrusting experts, most notably his own intelligence community and government scientists.
“Democrats will always say horrible things,"" Trump said. ""Democrats want us to fail so badly.”
Trump — who has been criticized for painting an overly rosy picture of the outbreak, often contradicting his own health officials — insisted on Friday that his administration was “magnificently organized” and “totally prepared"" to address the virus.

""My administration has taken the most aggressive acts in history to prevent the spread in the United States,"" Trump said, touting his decision to ban foreign nationals recently in China from entering the U.S.
Trump again drew a misleading comparison between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu, telling his supporters that ""35,000 on average each year die from the flu, that's a lot of people.""
“So far we have lost nobody to coronavirus,"" Trump said, suggesting the growing global panic was due to the press being in a ""hysteria mode.""
Experts say that the coronavirus is significantly more contagious than the flu and a vaccine is at least a year to 18 months away.
Trump faced bipartisan pressure after he requested $2.5 billion in coronavirus response funding, which lawmakers from both parties said wasn't enough. He later said that if Congress wants to grant additional funds, ""I'll take it.""
More than 83,000 people have been sickened by the coronavirus and at least 2,857 have died since the start of January when the virus was first discovered in China. As the virus spread rapidly across Europe and the Middle East this past week, Wall Street suffered its worst week since the financial crisis.

Trump, who ran on a promise to build a southern border wall, used the outbreak as another opportunity to attack Democrats' position on immigration and border security.
“We must understand that border security is also health security,” Trump added, as rallygoers chanted “build the wall.” “The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”
Trump’s rally in South Carolina comes on the eve of the Democratic primary here on Saturday, and it's the latest example of the president’s counterprogramming strategy to hold large events where Democrats are campaigning and voting, competing with them for media attention.","['overly', 'rosy', 'contradicting']"

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
The mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, last August that left 22 dead was ""the worst carnage wrought by domestic extremists"" last year, according to a report released Wednesday that found an increase in the number of white nationalist groups in the United States for the second straight year.
The report by Southern Poverty Law Center reported, which tracks white nationalism, white supremacy and hate groups, identified 155 white nationalist groups in the U.S. last year, up from 148 in 2018 and a 55 percent increase since 2017.
Authorities say the gunman in the Aug. 3 attack in El Paso told police that his target was ""Mexicans"" and that he posted a manifesto before the attack that included anti-Latino and anti-immigrant rhetoric. The SPLC has reported that the gunman's screed contained white nationalist talking points ""on “ethnic displacement"" and ""race mixing"" and refers to immigrants to the United States as ""invaders.""
Radical right's fear of ""white genocide""
According to the report, ""the most powerful force animating today’s radical right—and stoking the violent backlash—is a deep fear of demographic change,"" and the idea that ""white genocide"" is under way.
The SPLC said there is a growing threat from a sector of white supremacists who call themselves “accelerationists” who believe violence is the tool that can counter increasingly pluralistic, democratic governments.

That ideology is believed to have been followed by the gunman in the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, 2019. The SPLC said white nationalism violence is also rising globally.
Amid the increase in white nationalist groups, there was a dip in hate groups from 1,020 to 940 last year, largely due to a collapse in Neo Nazi groups and a decline in Ku Klux Klan, Christian identity and neo-Confederate groups, SPLC senior researcher Howard Graves told NBC News.
But the SPLC writes that the decline of those groups has been replaced with a broader acceptance of white nationalist ideas under President Donald Trump's administration.
The SPLC last year released hundreds of emails of Stephen Miller,the architect of Trump’s immigration policies such as the child-parent separations at the border and the Muslim ban, in which he cited and promoted ""explicitly white nationalist websites.""
“As the country continues to experience white nationalist terror, extremist ideas long believed outside of the realm of legitimate politics are penetrating deeply into the mainstream, spawning public policies that target immigrants, LGBTQ people and Muslims,” the SPLC said in its report.
“Inclusive democracy is in the crosshairs of hate and bigotry. White nationalists no longer seek to simply spread their views — they are committed to seizing the power of the state,” Eric Ward, executive director of Western States Center, a social justice organization that advocates for “inclusive democracy,” said in a statement.
Sharp rise in anti-LGBTQ groups
The SPLC has also logged a sharp expansion of anti-LGBTQ groups, up 43 percent from 49 in 2018 to 70 last year and a smaller increase in anti-immigrant groups from 17 in 2018 to 20 last year.
The FBI found last year that nearly 1 in 5 crimes were motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias.
“The resurgence of these groups poses a real danger to LGBTQ people and to the progress we have made, which feels increasingly precarious in the face of this administration’s shocking support for anti-LGBTQ groups and apparent determination to roll back even the most basic legal protections for LGBTQ people,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, who was part of a teleconference on the SPLC report.

Trump’s evangelical cabal are behind Republican attacks on women’s reproductive rights.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/judge-blocks-trumps-evangelical-assault-on-women-in-13-states/,alternet,gender,left,81.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Trump’s evangelical cabal are behind Republican attacks on women’s reproductive rights.
With myriad national crises consuming the lion’s share of the news cycles since Trump shutdown the government to impress Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter, with valuable assistance from Mitch McConnell, it was easy to miss what should be considered good news for women in 13 states – even if it is only temporary.
While many women, and the men who love them, are well aware that, spurred on by the Vatican , United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( USCCB ) and the so-called personhood movement, Republicans are working feverishly to eradicate women’s reproductive rights.
Since the conservative Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby ruling gave religious corporations the right to withhold contraception coverage from their employees, the Vatican-affiliated religious right has been on a tear to allow every employer to punish women, married or otherwise, who dare to have sexual relations “without consequences.”
Although Trump is not remotely religious, and certainly not a Christian by any measure, his administration has spent no small amount of energy to make a “substantial number of women lose access to birth control coverage” because it is contrary to the 1968 Papal encyclical on life – the so-called Humanae Vitae .
Last Friday during a hearing in California to block Trump’s effort to allow more employers to withhold the “contraception benefit” in health plans on “religious and moral grounds,” U.S. Federal Judge Haywood Gilliam remarked that the goal of the evangelicals’ rule was specifically to withhold contraception from “a substantial number of women.” The case was a continuation of the Hobby Lobby ruling objecting to the “contraception mandate” in health plans.
That vile Hobby Lobby ruling did not prevent all women from taking advantage of the contraception benefit, so Trump’s evangelical rule change attempted to extend the religious right’s control over women’s reproductive rights. It was mere months after Trump’s poorly-attended inauguration that his evangelical cabal eliminated the “contraception benefit” to satisfy the theocratic anti-women’s movement.
Specifically, the rule change allows more employers, including publicly traded companies, to control women’s reproductive health under the guise of “religious liberty.” Private employers were also given authority to withhold contraception coverage on whatever they claim are “moral grounds.”
The rule change was set to go into effect on Monday past, but after deliberation Judge Gilliam issued a preliminary injunction on Sunday to stop the rules from going into effect; but only for the 12 states and the District of Columbia that joined California to protect women’s bodily autonomy.
Judge Gilliam had previously blocked an “interim version” of the evangelicals’ rules, and equally noteworthy that his decision was upheld by a federal appellate court just last month. The latest case was necessary because the Trump evangelicals “finalized” the rules prompting another legal challenge by California, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia to protect women’s right to self-determination regarding reproduction.
The Judge did not block the rules from going into effect for the rest of the nation – likely because the remaining states are enamored with “trampling women’s access to basic reproductive care” and refused to join 13 other states to protect women’s reproductive rights. That was how California Attorney General Xavier Becerra framed what Trump and his religious right control-freaks’ goal is in expanding the Hobby Lobby decision across the workforce – “trample on women.” Mr. Becerra said:
“The law couldn’t be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women’s healthcare decisions. Today’s court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women’s access to basic reproductive care. It’s 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women’s rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.”
It is almost certain that the fight to ensure women’s freedom to make their own reproductive healthcare choices will continue despite the latest ruling. The 2014 Hobby Lobby case was the first time the Supreme Court recognized a for-profit corporation’s absurd claim of religious beliefs, and because that ruling was “limited to closely held corporations,” the anti-women’s choice movement has been frothing at the mouth to eliminate that “limitation;” anything to give greater numbers of employers authority to control women’s reproductive health choices.
It is worth remarking that President Barack Obama went to great lengths to accommodate all manner of anti-women’s organizations’ so-called religious objections to women marking their own reproductive health choices, but it was never enough. The anti-women’s rights movement objects to any woman deciding her own reproductive health and despite the law, they will not rest until all women are put in a place the Vatican and personhood movement insists they belong – in perpetual birth mode.
At least women in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia still have a measure of bodily independence, but with Trump’s religious right judges on the High Court, it is likely that autonomy is in jeopardy.
That is the price women are going to pay because there is an unwritten law in America that citing religion as the reason for the never-ending attacks on women’s rights is tantamount to committing treason. It is high time for Americans, especially those concerned about women’s rights, to cease pretending that America is not lurching towards a theocracy. All of these vile Republican policies attacking women’s rights have only one source – religion.","['evangelical', 'cabal']"
"Donald Trump is not an ideas man. This has been a defining feature of his presidency. He’s not a learned policy wonk, understanding the complex nuances of law and governance. He is, at his core, just a former game show host and a con man.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/trump-was-asked-how-to-restore-black-americans-trust-in-police-but-he-could-only-talk-about-himself/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,81.0,4.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Donald Trump is not an ideas man. This has been a defining feature of his presidency. He’s not a learned policy wonk, understanding the complex nuances of law and governance. He is, at his core, just a former game show host and a con man.
Never is this more clear than when reporters ask him about public policy problems he’s not prepared for. (Of course, even on topics where Trump should be prepared, like health care, he struggles to put together a coherent thought.)
This happens even with friendly outlets. On Wednesday, Trump appeared with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on his radio show. And in an exchange flagged by CNN’s Daniel Dale, Kilmeade asked a surprisingly decent and provocative question.
Trump had no idea how to respond, so he just rambled. But his rambling was revealing. It’s worth quoting the entire exchange in full:
Kilmeade: But this is the one stat I’m going to bring you to, and I’m going to ask you if could attack this.
According to an Axios-Ipsos poll, 70% of white Americans say they trust the local police. Only 36% of African-
Americans do. How do you attack that problem? How do you change things? Trump: Well I think it’s a very sad problem. As you know, as a Republican I’m doing very well with African- Americans and with the vote, with the — in polls and everything — especially, I mean I haven’t seen one very recently because you had the plague come in from China, so that changed things up, but we had the best economy ever, we had the best numbers for African-American employment and unemployment in history. Best homeownership — best everything. We had the best numbers in everything — not only African-American, but the African-American numbers were great. K: But how do you handle the law enforcement part of this? How do you handle the law enforcement part of this? T: Well I think you have to get better than what they’ve been doing. I mean obviously that was a terrible thing. And I’ve spoken about it numerous times in various speeches. And you know, it’s interesting: I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket — a tremendous program that culminated on that day and obviously it goes on from there. But I then made a speech and it was a speech about the rocket, and I devoted 25% of the speech probably to what happened — or more — to what happened with respect to George — George Floyd, and it was — and then you listen to news, ‘He doesn’t talk about George Floyd.’ The rocket went off, I then I made a speech, and I talked about George Floyd, but they said he didn’t talk about George Floyd. Half — maybe even almost half of the speech, but a large portion of the speech was devoted exactly to that. And so, you know, with — with the media you basically — basically no matter what you do, it’s never going to be good enough. But the people understand it. K: Right. T: And that’s one of the beauties to social media. I mean, I would love not to even bother with social media. but
I’m able to get my word out beautifully by social media. Fortunately. You use social media too. K: Right, also — T: But we have to get the word out. Look, we have to — Brian, we have to get the police departments, everybody has to do better, has to do better. This is a long-term problem. This didn’t happen today. This happened — I mean, a guy like Sleepy Joe Biden was in there for 43 years, then he says, ‘I think we should do this’ — I saw today, he took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven’t seen his face for a long time. And he said, ‘I think we should do this,’ or ‘I think we should do that.’ And actually then he started speaking through the mask again. He feels comfortable with the mask on, I think, and — even though there was nobody anywhere near him, which is interesting. But he made a statement about what he should do. I said, he’s been there for 43 years, he was vice president for 8 years, he didn’t do a thing. His crime bill was a disaster.
When asked about African-Americans, Trump did what he normally does and began talking about the economic success the country enjoyed before the pandemic. His claiming credit for this success is highly dubious and contestable, and it was completely unrelated to the question asked. So Kilmeade asked again.
And still, Trump had nothing to say. So again, he just started talking about himself. He reverted to a comfortable topic, claiming that the media was unfair because it supposedly ignored his comments about George Floyd’s death when he appeared at NASA. But what he’s really demonstrating is that he has no ideas for how to actually address the problems the protesters are calling out. He seems to either be convinced that what he has said about Floyd should be enough to solve the problems, or he’s unable to comprehend that there are concerns about public policy that have nothing to do with him in particular.
Finally, he launched into a meandering rant about Biden, suggesting that under the Obama administration, nothing was done to fix policing in the United States. While the previous administration surely didn’t do enough, and Biden himself has contributed to the criminal justice problems in the country, Trump completely ignored the fact that the Obama Justice Department actually did take significant steps toward reform following the protests in Ferguson. Under Trump, those efforts were rolled back.","['con', 'man', 'ideas']"
"Mulvaney apparently didn’t see this line of inquiry coming, so he was left in an awkward spot: Democrats are trying to embarrass Trump, but his chief of staff has no idea why Trump would be embarrassed by his own tax materials.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-would-trump-be-embarrassed-his-tax-returns,msnbc,middle-class,left,81.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney sat down with CBS News’ Major Garrett this week for a podcast interview that covered a fair amount of ground. Of particular interest, though, was the exchange that began at the 23:12 mark of the conversation.
The host noted that the Treasury Department has refused a congressional order to turn over Donald Trump’s tax returns, and Garrett asked why. This was the exchange that followed:
MULVANEY: Because they are not entitled to see them by law. By the way, they know, especially on this one, they know they’re never going to get these documents. This is a pure show-pony-type of situation. They know the legal reasons they can get those documents – GARRETT: Legitimate legislative function. MULVANEY: Right. And they’re not even close to that… They’re just doing this to make the president look bad. They don’t care. This is not about information about the president. Keep in mind, all of the president’s financial holdings, by law, are disclosed. Want to know what the president owns? Want to know how he makes money? All of that stuff is, by law, I have to fill out my form by the end of next week. So does he. This is just about trying to embarrass the president. GARRETT: What’s embarrassing about his tax records? MULVANEY: That’s what they want to know. GARRETT: But what is it? MULVANEY: I don’t know because I’ve never seen GARRETT: Is there something embarrassing about his tax records? MULVANEY: I have no idea and I don’t care.
Oh my.
First, when Mulvaney says Congress is not “entitled” to the president’s tax materials “by law,” that’s true, just so long as one overlooks the law. In reality, existing federal law, which has been on the books for nearly a century, says the Treasury Department “shall furnish” the tax materials in response to a formal request from one of a handful of congressional lawmakers.
That formal request has been made, and at least for now, it’s been ignored despite the letter of the statute.
Second, Mulvaney suggests Trump’s legally required financial disclosure forms show “how he makes money.” That’s not quite right: disclosure forms show what the president has, not how he got it.
To know more about the sources of his wealth, we’d need – let’s all say it together – his tax returns.
But it’s Major Garrett’s good follow-up question that stands out for a reason: the White House’s acting chief of staff is convinced that the effort to obtain Trump’s tax returns is intended to “embarrass the president,” which naturally leads one to wonder why Trump would be embarrassed by his tax returns.
Mulvaney apparently didn’t see this line of inquiry coming, so he was left in an awkward spot: Democrats are trying to embarrass Trump, but his chief of staff has no idea why Trump would be embarrassed by his own tax materials.
And, Mulvaney added, he doesn’t care.
The South Carolina Republican’s indifference notwithstanding, given everything we’ve learned of late about Trump’s financial life, there are all kinds of reasons for the rest of us to care.","['embarrassed', 'awkward']"

Given the latest revelations, and the way in which Pompeo's State Department forced Yovanovitch from her post under scandalous circumstances, the question was more than fair.
The nation's chief diplomat didn't seem to agree, however. He complained about the line of inquiry and complained about the Obama administration for a while, before the host narrowed the focus, asking about the State Department personnel who've resigned because of Pompeo's refusal to stand up for American diplomats. He balked, attributing the concerns to ""unnamed sources.""
Kelly wasted little time in reminding the Kansas Republican that the sources aren't unnamed at all: his own State Department senior adviser, Michael McKinley, a career Foreign Service officer with four decades experience, testified under oath about the department's failures in this area.

Pompeo said he wouldn't comment on McKinley's assessment, either, though he insisted that he's ""defended every State Department official"" since taking the reins at the cabinet agency. The NPR host, likely realizing that this claim wasn't true, pressed further on this specific point:
KELLY: Respectfully, where have you defended Marie Yovanovich? POMPEO: I've defended every single person on this team I've done what's right for every person on this team. KELLY: Can you point me towards your remarks? POMPEO: I've said all I'm going to say.
On the one hand, I'm glad to see Pompeo sit down for interviews with outlets outside the conservative media bubble. On the other hand, when the secretary of State does sit down for these interviews, they don't seem to go well.
Pompeo appeared hopelessly lost when WSMV’s Nancy Amon was far better prepared for an interview than he was. Soon after, the cabinet secretary’s interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos was every bit as cringe-worthy. Reflecting on Pompeo’s on-air comments, MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace told viewers, “That was the worst appearance by an executive branch official I’ve ever seen in my career.”
Soon after, the secretary sat down with KMUV in Wichita and threw a minor tantrum when asked to defend State Department employees against Donald Trump's attacks.
Pompeo also spoke with the Wichita Eagle in November, and that interview turned messy, too: when asked about the impact on U.S. credibility when the White House fails to honor its partnership with the Kurds, the secretary replied, ""The whole predicate of your question is insane."" (It was actually quite sane.)
As we discussed at the time, if Pompeo can’t handle some of these basic questions, why does he keep agreeing to interviews?

"Of course, viruses don’t just “go away” regardless of the amount of propaganda or wishful thinking you throw at them. His theory, however, is telling. Trump’s strategy from the beginning of this crisis has been to minimize the threat and wish it away.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/poor-donald-trump-has-no-fixer-to-make-covid-19-go-away/,alternet,coronavirus,left,82.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"“I feel about vaccines like I feel about tests. This is going to go away without a vaccine, it’s gonna go away, and we’re not going to see it again, hopefully.”
Donald Trump said something Friday that should have ended his re-election prospects the moment it left his mouth:
Of course, viruses don’t just “go away” regardless of the amount of propaganda or wishful thinking you throw at them. His theory, however, is telling. Trump’s strategy from the beginning of this crisis has been to minimize the threat and wish it away. His refusal to initiate a comprehensive federal testing-and-contact-tracing program has as much to do with his refusal to acknowledge the seriousness of the pandemic as it does with the Republican laissez-faire approach to public policy.
Still, why would Trump say this? The usual conservative response to a public crisis is that it doesn’t really exist and the free market will magically fix it, anyway. It’s not that the problem will disappear on its own, which is a small child’s response to challenges.
The simple answer is that, ever since he was a young man, Trump has never had to confront any problem that somebody else didn’t just make disappear. Trump has always used an army of attorneys, accountants and corrupted officials to make his problems go away—whether it was with women, creditors, contractors, or law enforcement. Usually, he would have a main consligiere to take on the heaviest burdens, from the detestable Roy Cohn to Michael Cohen to Roger Stone to Rudy Giuliani and, most recently, his own personal Attorney General William Barr. Now that he is president, Trump views the entire federal government as his personal fiefdom to clean up his messes and cover for his open corruption.
But a virus is immune to the protections to which Trump has become accustomed. It does what it does, and Trump finds himself helpless and flummoxed.
There has never been a crisis so big in Trump’s life that he hasn’t been able to use people much more talented and intelligent than himself to make it go away quietly and efficiently. So in Trump’s experience, that’s what problems do: They go away. He has “good genes”; he surrounds himself with “the best people”—willing to cross any moral line for him and bad things just … disappear. All he has to do in the meantime is manage the press with a con man’s combination of razzle dazzle and intimidation. Actual work and accountability are for suckers and lesser people.
Casinos going bankrupt? Take the money and have the accountants stiff the investors. Affairs with porn stars while your wife was pregnant? Have your fixer pay them off. Real estate taxes a problem? Have some employees bribe the assessors. FBI Director threatening to expose your collusion with a hostile foreign power? Fire him by way of a patsy. Tough re-election campaign? Have your lawyer threaten a foreign country if they don’t make up a scandal about your opponent. And so on.
Remarkably, the first three years of Trump’s presidency were relatively smooth sailing outside of self-inflicted crimes and mishaps. His actual approach to life was never fully tested in the Oval Office. Now, with the first real challenge of his presidency, he is utterly adrift.
There is no amount of misdirection or intimidation he can use to make the press stories about all the deaths and economic destruction go away. There is no accountant, lawyer, or public official who can use clever paperwork to make the virus disappear. Solving this problem would require the sort of dedicated attention, tough choices, and hard work that Donald Trump has been able to spend his entire life successfully avoiding while thinking himself clever for doing so.
Trump merely asserts that coronavirus will just fix itself. If you think about it, that actually makes some sense, because every other problem in his Trump’s life has.","['propaganda', 'thinking']"
"The whiteness of the protests alongside the stark racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality underscores that the desire to reopen businesses is rooted in white supremacy. As if it weren’t already clear, in Michigan where the nation’s most prominent protest took place, armed white men demanded an end to the lockdown while carrying Confederate flags, swastikas, and nooses.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/05/why-the-calls-of-trump-and-protesters-to-return-to-normal-are-acts-of-white-supremacy/,alternet,coronavirus,left,82.0,2.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"When the coronavirus pandemic was first declared, Americans dutifully stayed at home to prevent outbreaks like the ones playing out in China and Italy. Although a majority of Americans continue to support quarantine orders intended to quell the spread of the virus, a growing number of anti-lockdown protests across the nation are sending a clear message that they don’t care about spreading infection or the rising death toll. The whiteness of the protests alongside the stark racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality underscores that the desire to reopen businesses is rooted in white supremacy. As if it weren’t already clear, in Michigan where the nation’s most prominent protest took place, armed white men demanded an end to the lockdown while carrying Confederate flags, swastikas, and nooses.
Ending lockdowns too early will kill more Americans—it’s that simple, and even the government’s own agencies project such a scenario. President Donald Trump has admitted it, saying, “Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.” Except that ending the lockdowns now will specifically kill far more African Americans than any other demographic. The health news website MedPage referred to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on blacks as a, “Wildly disproportionate mortality.” Research shows that African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at a rate that is, “2.3 times higher than the rate for Asians and Latinos, and 2.6 times higher than the rate for Whites.” In fact, whites are the least impacted demographic in the nation. In New York City, the national epicenter of the disease, the same racialized outcomes are observed, with more African Americans being hospitalized and dying from the disease than any other racial group, followed by Latinos.
Black and brown Americans are also more impacted financially by the virus-related lockdown. A Pew Research survey found that African Americans and Latinos were far more likely to lose their jobs and lack the savings to cover their expenses than whites.
State governors who are following Trump’s demands to reopen their economies know full well that their actions will cost lives. Like Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has admitted that reopening businesses will cost lives. In a private phone call to state lawmakers, Abbott said, “every scientific and medical report shows that whenever you have a reopening—whether you want to call it a reopening of businesses or of just a reopening of society—in the aftermath of something like this, it actually will lead to an increase and spread. It’s almost ipso facto.” Seeing through Abbott’s agenda, Rae Martinez, the director of Texas Rising, tweeted that he, “does not care about the lives of Texans, and specifically black and brown Texans.”
Missouri Governor Mike Parson, when asked why he did not observe the government’s guidelines to wear a mask in public, said, “I think it’s up to the individuals. I don’t think that’s government’s role to mandate who wears a mask and who don’t. I go back to what I’ve said all along: It’s your personal responsibility.” That sentiment perfectly captures the conservative position on health care, policing, poverty, and so many other issues. The idea of “personal responsibility” absolves the government from accepting its obligation to solve society’s inequalities.
President Trump and Vice President Pence have also signaled in the clearest terms to their reliable voter base of vocal activists that social distancing is not necessary and that each person is responsible for their own fate. Pence came under fire for refusing to wear a mask at a recent tour of Mayo Clinic (but later wore one at a tour of a GM facility). Trump went further in refusing to wear a mask while ironically touring a mask-making factory! The White House leadership is indicating directly through body language that it does not care about the virus and feels confidently immune to it.
Staying home, wearing masks, and keeping a 6-foot radius from others in public are all actions designed for collective protection. Not only do masks protect you from contamination, they protect others from being contaminated by you. In other words, people are being asked to consider the well-being of their fellow Americans. But for decades, this nation’s laws have treated health care as an individual privilege rather than a collective right. Our lack of a national health system has ensured that existing socioeconomic differences between racial groups are reproduced in health outcomes. Now, the white anti-lockdown protesters and their favored politicians are signaling through their actions that they don’t care about black and brown lives.
The pronouncements that this coronavirus pandemic has put “everyone in the same boat,” are ignorant of the very real systemic racial differences that allow white Americans to weather the same storm with far more resilience than black and brown Americans. If we had a national health system, Americans might be closer to finding themselves in the “same boat” as one another. But as it stands, an early return to “normal” threatens the lives of people of color disproportionately. Trump knows this and has exploited it to his benefit. It is no wonder that the same people who railed against the Affordable Care Act and Medicare for All are the same people who voted for the most racist president in memory, and who are now demanding an end to social distancing measures.
Just as preexisting differences in health access and financial stability are amplifying the racial outcomes of the coronavirus, we see the continuation of long-standing racist policing that targets blacks with violence and whites with tolerance for the same infractions. Even the policing of social distancing guidelines is racist, as the New York Police Department demonstrated recently in cordially handing out face masks to crowds of white park visitors while harassing and even beating African Americans in their own communities.
The white protesters screaming in the faces of police at capitol buildings feel confident they will not be met with state violence. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pointed out the hypocrisy of how well law enforcement showed restraint against the screaming activists, saying on Twitter, “Think about how harshly #BlackLivesMatter & #AbolishICE activists were debased, called rioters, & treated as a threat to society.” She added, “Now watch & examine how this MAGA-armed rushing of a state legislature is treated.”
We have tolerated this discriminatory and dangerous segment of society for far too long. It is time for the collective health and well-being of all Americans to be prioritized over the individual demands of a selfish minority that has dominated our political sphere and endangered our future.

"After Donald Trump’s outrageous photo op in which he used federal police to attack peaceful protesters so that he could walk to a church to hold up a Bible, others noted how inappropriate it was for General Mark Milley, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to not only be tailing behind Donald Trump during this publicized stunt but to be wearing his battle fatigues, something extremely inappropriate for the setting.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/retired-military-brass-sound-the-alarm-about-the-peril-trump-poses-to-democracy/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,82.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Retired four-star Marine General John Allen has seen enough. In a op-ed for Foreign Policy, Allen tore into Donald Trump and his orders to attack American citizens in front of the White House. Allen said he fears we are “witnessing the beginning of the end of American democracy.”
In a three-part breakdown of how Trump has failed this moment and the nation, (Ret.) Gen. Allen specifically called out this administration singling out antifa—a leaderless movement that is, by definition, anti-fascist—as a terrorist group while ignoring the white supremacists who have been proven to be inciting violence at some of these protests. Allen said: “Far more damage to the United States has come from these terrorists—fascists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis, all feeling newly empowered today—than those who have opposed them.”
For the record, the FBI found “no intelligence linking Antifa to violence at the Black Lives Matter protests.”
Allen wasn’t the only former Marine general to come forward. General Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis, who served as Trump’s secretary of defense for a stint, has finally come forward with his own warning: ”We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.” In a statement to CNN, Mattis said: “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us.”
That, of course, drove Donald Trump to rage because he quickly tweeted saying he had fired Mattis, essentially saying he was a disgruntled employee. That sparked another former general, John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff, to immediately correct the record:
“The president did not fire him. He did not ask for his resignation,” Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, said in an interview. “The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then The got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.”
The aforementioned disagreement was Trump’s still-curious decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria.
On Tuesday, retired U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, who served as the 17th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also took aim at Trump’s brutal policies against American citizens. In an op-ed in The Atlantic, Mullen said he “cannot remain silent” anymore.
It sickened me yesterday to see security personnel—including members of the National Guard—forcibly and violently clear a path through Lafayette Square to accommodate the president’s visit outside St. John’s Church. I have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump’s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent.
In fact, a steady stream of retired senior military officials are using social media to speak out this week. That should alarm every single American. They are trying to tell us all that the president is unfit for duty.
America’s military, our sons and daughters, will place themselves at risk to protect their fellow citizens. Their job is unimaginably hard overseas; harder at home. Respect them, for they respect you. America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy. #BeBetter — GEN(R) Martin E. Dempsey (@Martin_Dempsey) June 1, 2020
(Ret.) Gen. Tony Thomas, the former commander of the United States Special Operations Command, spoke out on Twitter after hearing Defense Secretary Mark Esper describe American cities as “battle space” during the protests.
After Donald Trump’s outrageous photo op in which he used federal police to attack peaceful protesters so that he could walk to a church to hold up a Bible, others noted how inappropriate it was for General Mark Milley, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to not only be tailing behind Donald Trump during this publicized stunt but to be wearing his battle fatigues, something extremely inappropriate for the setting. Retired Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden noted as much on Twitter.

America’s retired military commandeers are speaking out and sounding the alarm. The real question is: Where are Republicans? Why do they remain silent while our democracy is being burned to the ground on national television? It’s clear to all Donald Trump is unfit for duty, so why do they continue to enable him? It’s only possible with their consent. When this all ends, they must be held accountable too.","['inappropriate', 'stunt', 'publicized', 'outrageous']"
That’s why a new proposal from a bevy of progressive lawmakers comes as a welcome and innovative addition to the policy arsenal: increasing the corporate tax rate in accordance with the gap between CEO pay and median worker pay.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/11/how-progressive-lawmakers-seek-to-take-on-the-egregious-scale-of-ceo-pay/,alternet,middle-class,left,83.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Tackling wealth inequality is admittedly hard. The rich have access to very good accountants, lawyers, and lobbyists. There are a lot of places for them to stash their wealth. Loopholes are easy to create. Not to mention, they can always move (although they don’t carry out the threat nearly as often as conservatives would have you believe) if they really don’t like or can’t escape the tax bill.
Solving the problem requires a variety of approaches from many different angles: wealth taxes, financial transaction taxes, estate taxes, corporate taxes, loophole elimination, campaign finance changes, tax haven penalties, etc. Any one of them may fail, or be easy for certain classes of individuals to escape. Collectively, however, they can both put a dent in the deficit allowing for greater expenditures on social services and climate change abatement. More importantly, they can reduce the corrosive wealth inequality that is eating away at our democracy. Reducing the amount of the money hoarded by the obscenely wealthy would be a good thing on its own merits, even if it were merely burned in a bonfire rather than added to the Treasury.
That’s why a new proposal from a bevy of progressive lawmakers comes as a welcome and innovative addition to the policy arsenal: increasing the corporate tax rate in accordance with the gap between CEO pay and median worker pay. Here’s the general idea:
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) introduced the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, which rewrites the federal tax code to tackle the inequality crisis created by corporate America’s unrestrained greed. The typical restaurant employee at McDonald’s would have to work for more than 2,000 years to earn what the company’s CEO Chris Kempczinski received last year. A retail worker at Gap Inc. would have to work for more than 3,000 years to receive the annual compensation of Gap’s former CEO Art Peck. Peck’s pay was increased by 33 percent in 2018, even after he presided over years of declines in sales and stock prices. The Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act would pressure corporations to curb these outrageous pay gaps that are the norm today, by imposing graduated taxes for companies that pay their CEO more than 50 times the pay of the median worker. The tax penalties would begin at 0.5 percentage points and rise to 5 percentage points for firms compensating their chief executives at more than 500 times the rate of their workers. A recent report by the Institute for Policy Studies found that 80 percent of S&P 500 firms paid their CEOs more than 100 times the pay of their median worker. Many of the firms lavishing multi-million-dollar compensation packages on their top executives rely on taxpayer support—through public housing, nutrition assistance, and Medicaid, for example—to assist full-time workers who struggle with poverty wages.
CEO pay around the world, and especially in the United States, has become outrageous. While the average worker has only seen their compensation grow by 12 percent since 1968, the pay of the average CEO has increased by a whopping 940 percent since 1978. It’s not just an outrageous injustice that so many workers are being laid off, off-shored, and made insecure while the top executives make a killing. It also offends our very sense of how the economy is supposed to work: after all, it’s not as if CEOs are now a thousand times more productive than they were 40 years ago.
In fact, the opposite is true: CEOs used to stick with a company for nearly a lifetime, their own reputation and financial well-being tied to the company’s. Now, they’re migrant mercenaries goosing quarterly profit in the short term while leaving the next guy holding the bag to deal with the consequences of the corners they cut. It breaks our understanding of the social and moral compact that underpins the political economy and the credibility of modern capitalism itself as an economic system. It would be great to pass the money being funneled to CEOs back to workers either in the form of wages or social program redistribution. But failing that, it would serve a valuable social good just to burn that money in a fire rather than continue to deliver it to the undeserving rich to buy another yacht.
Critics will call this a gimmick that doesn’t singlehandedly solve the problem, but ultimately, that isn’t the point.
First, it delivers a key political message: we understand that the economy is broken, that the social fabric is fraying, that the wrong people are being overcompensated for the wrong reasons, and that we intend to do something about that specifically.
Second, it attacks one of the aspects of wealth inequality in a direct, pre-distributive way. Rather than trying to claw back money from the obscenely wealthy after it has already been paid out, it incentivizes corporations not to give it to them in the first place. It puts coolant in the overheating engine that has been sending CEO pay skyrocketing to absurd levels in a chummy bidding war in the hands of a class of executives all too happy to distribute egregious sums to their friends and fellows.
Obviously, unless Democrats can both win the Senate and bypass the filibuster, this policy is dead on arrival against a wall of GOP obstruction. But it’s good to have in the back pocket in the meantime, and it would serve as excellent policy to campaign on as we approach the 2020 election, reminding the American people who is actually on the side of the average worker to build a fairer economy.

"President Donald Trump has been doubling down on his love of tariffs this week, vowing to increase tariffs on Chinese imports.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/05/revealed-the-stunning-annual-costs-of-trumps-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-us-consumers-and-businesses/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,83.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"President Donald Trump has been doubling down on his love of tariffs this week, vowing to increase tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump’s tariffs, however, aren’t limited to China: he has also been imposing tariffs on U.S. allies such as Canada and Mexico. And according to analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, steel and aluminum tariffs are costing Americans hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Analysis from the Peterson Institute shows that consumers and businesses in the United States are paying over $900,000 per year for every job created or saved by Trump’s steel tariffs. The Independent quotes Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute and the person who did the steel tariffs calculation, as saying that the cost of Trump’s steel tariffs is “very high. It’s arresting. The reason it’s so high is that steel is a very capital-intensive industry. There are not many workers.”
Trump, however, has vigorously defended his steel tariffs, insisting that they have been a success—especially in Pennsylvania, a swing state that Trump won in 2016 and is hoping to win again in 2020. Last week, the president tweeted, “232 Tariffs make Pennsylvania and USA more prosperous/secure by bringing Steel and Aluminum industries BACK. Tariffs are working. Pittsburgh is again The Steel City. USA economy is BOOMING!”
One critic of Trump’s steel tariffs is James Knott, Jr., chief executive of the Northbridge, Massachusetts-based Riverdale Mills Corporation (which manufactures wire mesh products). In the Independent, Knott is quoted as saying of tariffs, “The consumer pays for this in the end; they just don’t always recognize it. These 232 tariffs protect my foreign competition rather than protecting me.”","['love', 'of', 'tariffs']"
"There were many reasons that Trump defeated Clinton in 2016, and sexism was surely among them. ",https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/of-course-a-woman-can-beat-trump/,alternet,gender,left,83.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Polling for the Democratic nomination tells a depressing story for those seeking to break the glass ceiling and make the ultimate stand against patriarchy: the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are currently all white men. Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg lead in almost every poll; the closest female contenders, Warren and Harris, are stalled in single digits often tied with Beto O’Rourke. Which means that nationally known and highly qualified women Senators are tied with a failed Senate candidate and trailing the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, just a few short years after the party nominated its first female candidate for president and four years after the first Afircan-American president left office.
Part of the problem is that many Democratic women are no longer convinced that a woman can beat Trump, and are supporting white men for reasons of electability:
Across Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, three of the first states to hold 2020 nominating contests, dozens of women told The Associated Press that they are worried about whether the country is ready to elect a woman as president. Their concerns are political and personal, rooted as much in fear of repeating Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss to Trump as in their own experiences with sexism and gender discrimination… Helen Holden Slottje, a 52-year-old New Hampshire attorney, noted the irony in women raising concerns about nominating a woman. “I fear for that with women, that it’s, ‘Well, we had our chance. We had Hillary. Hillary didn’t pan out. Best to just pick another 65-year-old plus white guy who has the best chance of winning,’” Slottje said.
This is a tragedy, and it’s simply not true. In most head-to-head polling, Senators Warren and Harris would both easily defeat Trump. There were many reasons that Trump defeated Clinton in 2016, and sexism was surely among them. But sexism wasn’t the sole determining factor. Racism played a big part. There was historic cheating and interference from Russia, Comey and much else. Democrats failed to accurately gauge the more populist mood of much of the country, and their views of the real economy beyond the traditional indicators. And Clinton’s campaign simply made a number of profound strategic mistakes.
But in the narrative that followed the 2016 campaign, much of the media and messaging targeted at Democrats repeated that Clinton had done essentially nothing wrong, that Democrats had run the best possible campaign under the circumstances, and that the blame for what happened in 2016 lay not with errors of judgment by the campaigns and those responsible for messaging and tactics at the highest levels of the party, but with the voters themselves. Much of this defense was erected in order to combat recriminations and complaints from the surging Sanders wing of the party–many of which have admittedly ill-founded.
But as I’ve warned in the past, the insistence that nothing could have been done to persuade many of those who voted for Trump without throwing disadvantaged communities under the bus is not only wrong, but carries a heavy price. If you believe that no amount of economic populism or strategic difference could have made a difference in keeping Trump out of the Oval Office, then the necessary and inevitable conclusion is that the public is simply too racist and sexist to elect a woman or person of color against an explicitly racist candidate like Trump. And then predictably, voters most concerned about driving Trump out of office will wind up supporting a white man for misguided strategic reasons.
And that is tragic. A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office.
Kamala Harris would easily be able to dispatch Trump. So would Elizabeth Warren. The polling already shows that, and much the public still has yet to get to know them better. Harris is still largely an unknown, and most voters who know Warren are most familiar not with her strengths but with her weaknesses. More exposure would help them both.
But if Democrats want to avoid setting up yet another older white man as their nominee, they have to be willing to acknowledge that things could have been done differently in 2016 to avoid defeat. Otherwise, the Democratic base is going to draw regrettable conclusions about the state of the electorate and act accordingly.","['surely', 'sexism']"
"Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/07/fox-news-has-gone-so-deep-into-white-nationalism-that-donald-trump-now-believes-its-how-hell-win-in-2020/,alternet,white-nationalism,left,83.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Donald Trump thinks white nationalism is going to win him the 2020 election. This much is clear. Trump’s racist Twitter rant on Sunday — in which he suggested that four nonwhite congresswomen, three of whom were born in the United States, are “originally” from somewhere else and should therefore “go back” — might have seemed at first like a spontaneous eruption of racist rage from the simmering bigot in the White House.
Soon, however, it became clear that this was strategic. Trump thinks it’s a winning move to echo the claims of David Duke and other white nationalists who believe the United States is for white people. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK.
As Heather Digby Parton argued for Salon, this is more than an explosion of racist anger. Trump “believes that most Americans are as racist as he is and that he will be rewarded for this indecency with a second term.”
There’s good reason to think Trump and his boosters are wrong about this. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out on Twitter, “Trump’s popularity has taken its sharpest dips whenever he goes full racist,” and that even that seemingly rock-solid level of support that sits right around 42% in opinion polls has dipped into the 30s when Trump openly aligns himself with white nationalist views. Thanks largely to his racism (as well as his stunning lack of competence), Trump has spent his entire term in office with lower overall approval ratings than any president in more than 60 years.
So where does Trump getting this idea that ever more extreme racism is the way to win over voters? One major source is likely his favorite TV network and the only source of information he tends to take seriously: Fox News.
For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people — perhaps with others permitted in small numbers of they stay quiet and keep to themselves. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Such “birther” theories rested fairly obviously, in the first place, on the belief that black people cannot be “real” Americans.
Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity. At Salon, we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability.
Since then, Carlson and many of other Fox News pundits have only grown bolder. “Replacement theory” — the white nationalist idea that has spurred multiple terrorist attacks, holding that white people will somehow be removed and “replaced” by people of color — used to be confined to fringe neo-Nazi websites with atrocious early-2000s design aesthetics. Now that’s become a regular feature of slick Fox News segments, which suggest that immigrants of color are “invading the country” and can never be “fully American,” and that demographic changes from immigration are “more change than human beings are designed to digest” and inherently a threat to “your neighborhood.”
The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. (For about the 400th time: Immigrants, documented or otherwise, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. There is no serious dispute about this.) Furthermore, because many immigrants speak languages other than English and may eat unfamiliar food or bring cultural practices that appear foreign to some, American society will soon be “tipping over a cliff.”
This is the same kind of rhetoric that was used to demonize the Irish and Italian immigrants of the past, who were seen as threats to American culture due to scary foreign practices like putting garlic in food and praying with the Rosary. One hardly needs to mention the bigotry and discrimination directed at Jewish immigrants, who were barred from certain neighborhoods and many commercial establishments well into the 20th century. Unfortunately, most of the Fox News audience for this rhetoric, the president included, doesn’t know anything about that history, or care to learn.
It’s true that Fox News ratings are high, and that is incredibly meaningful to Trump, who has a long-standing obsession with TV ratings dating back to his days as host of “The Apprentice.” More important still, Trump tends to view TV ratings as the single most meaningful metric of public opinion, one that far outweighs more statistically significant measures like political polling.
In looking over Trump’s Twitter obsession with TV ratings, it’s clear that he believes — or at least pretends to believe — that ratings are tied tightly to alliance with his racist agenda. It’s not just that he routinely mocks CNN and MSNBC for supposedly having poor ratings. Any TV product that deviates too far from a racist agenda, he believes, takes a ratings hit for it. When NFL players were protesting racism, Trump gleefully declared it was hurting TV ratings. When the Oscars tried to improve racial diversity and attendees decried Trump’s bigotry, he gloated that it was the “Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY”. He even repeatedly (and falsely) tried to argue that his inauguration ratings exceeded Barack Obama’s.
The pattern is clear: Trump believes racism is more popular than anti-racism, because, he believes, racism gets TV viewers and anti-racism doesn’t. And getting TV viewers is the only measurement he takes seriously.
By any measure of cable viewership, there is no denying that Fox News has disturbingly high ratings. Its daytime audience is 1.3 million viewers on average and the prime time shows pull 2.4 million people. That doesn’t just outdo other cable news networks, but mainstays like TNT and HGTV. Carlson gets nearly 3 million viewers a night, numbers that far exceed his rabid fan base of open white nationalists. Racism does sell, and the audience for white nationalist rhetoric is not small.
But those numbers do not even come close to a majority of Americans, or even of American voters. Nearly 129 million Americans voted in 2016, meaning that only about 2% of the electorate is tuning into Carlson’s show on any given night. By contrast, the CBS sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” has nearly 19 million viewers. Racism sells, sure — but exponentially less well than unfunny sitcoms with aggressive laugh tracks.
Trump’s racism is wildly popular with his base, in other words, but a large majority of Americans find it repulsive. No amount of the president’s obsessive dissection of cable ratings will change that. That’s not to say Trump’s opponents should become complacent or assume that his unpopularity will automatically translate into a 2020 defeat. Unfortunately, racists are dramatically overrepresented in politics, due to the outdated mechanism of the Electoral College, which is how Trump won the 2016 election while getting nearly 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. He could certainly pull it off again.
Still, Trump’s apparently adamant belief that white nationalism will pay off in electoral terms doesn’t reflect any reputable political polling. It appears instead to be an artifact of his obsession with TV and with Fox News in particular. It’s a closed loop of awfulness: The more Trump pushes his racist agenda, the more the network amplifies his message, and the more he believes his bigotry is massively popular. Unless and until Trump takes a decisive L in 2020, he’s going to keep believing the majority of Americans are secretly on his side.","['rumblings', 'conspiracy', 'theories']"
"As the deadly COVID-19 contagion sweeps across the country, gun sales are surging, spurred in many regions by panic buying and purchases by first-time firearm owners. ",https://www.alternet.org/2020/04/the-supreme-court-is-poised-to-extend-gun-rights-at-the-worst-possible-time/,alternet,gun-control,left,83.0,1.0,Biased,Entirely factual,"“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” —Second Amendment to the United States Constitution
As the deadly COVID-19 contagion sweeps across the country, gun sales are surging, spurred in many regions by panic buying and purchases by first-time firearm owners. Fearful and insecure Americans are taking advantage of weak and ineffective gun-control laws and stocking up, as President Trump might say, “like never before.”
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is poised to issue its first major Second Amendment opinion in more than a decade in a case that originated, fittingly, in New York City, now the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. The case—New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York—has the potential to vastly extend the rights of gun owners, and not just in New York, but throughout the entire nation.
At issue is a New York City “rule” (the term the city uses for its local ordinances) that was adopted in 2001 to prohibit residents from transporting licensed handguns beyond municipal limits. The rule was challenged in a federal lawsuit filed in 2013 by the NRA’s New York affiliate and three individuals. A district court judge ruled in the city’s favor in 2015, as did the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018. The Supreme Court, however, agreed to review the case at the NRA’s request in January 2019, and heard oral arguments in December.
The plaintiffs contend that the city’s handgun transportation ban should be declared unconstitutional because it conflicts with the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 decision on the Second Amendment, District of Columbia v. Heller.
In Heller, the Supreme Court struck down a ban on handgun possession in the nation’s capital, ruling for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to gun ownership. Deeply controversial and hotly contested, Heller split the Supreme Court along strict ideological lines, and was resolved on the basis of a 5-4 vote of the justices. The late Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion stood the prior judicial consensus on the Second Amendment on its head, rejecting the great weight of prior scholarship and earlier court opinions, including the Supreme Court’s 1939 decision in United States v. Miller, that had construed the amendment as protecting gun ownership only in connection with service in long-antiquated state militias.
Scalia’s opinion was met by a blistering dissent written by Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired from the bench in 2010 and passed away last year. Drawing on a wide array of historical sources, Stevens chided Scalia for ignoring the actual debates that took place during the founding era on the ratification of the Constitution and the drafting of the Second Amendment. Those debates, in Stevens’ view, demonstrated the amendment’s purpose was not to safeguard individual gun rights, but to guarantee the survival of the militias as a “collective right” of the citizenry as an alternative to the creation of a large federal standing army.
Stevens lost the battle of persuasion in Heller, and in 2010, in another 5-4 decision that also featured a Stevens dissent—McDonald v. Chicago—the Supreme Court extended Heller, holding that the individual right to keep and bear arms was incorporated by the 14th Amendment’s due process clause and hence was applicable to the states and local governments. The Second Amendment, as interpreted by Scalia, thus became the law of the land.
Although Scalia and Stevens are no longer with us, the ideological divisions they represented remain on the Supreme Court today. Indeed, when it comes to gun rights, the current court is even more conservative than it was in 2008. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both appointed by Trump, are outspoken proponents of Scalia’s vision of the Second Amendment. And the tribunal’s remaining conservatives—Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—participated in Heller and joined Scalia’s majority opinion.
Still, Heller by no means precluded all measures of gun control. As the Second Circuit noted in its evaluation of the New York handgun transportation ban that is now before the court, Heller was technically limited to possession of guns in the home, and established no clear limits on legislation aimed at regulating gun rights outside of the home.
“Like most rights,” Scalia wrote in Heller, “the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited… [N]othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”
And in an enigmatic footnote to the above paragraph, Scalia added: “We identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.”
Adhering to Scalia’s reasoning, in the years following Heller, lower courts have upheld a broad range of state and local gun-control regulations, a dynamic that has prompted the NRA and other gun-lobby groups to urge the Supreme Court to take up another Second Amendment appeal to reaffirm the amendment’s importance and place stricter limits on gun control. They may have found the perfect test case in the New York transportation ban. Like Heller, the New York ban concerns an outright prohibition, which will be hard, if not impossible, to justify before the court’s conservative majority.
Realizing it would likely lose the case, New York City amended its transportation rule in June to permit residents to take their handguns to second homes, businesses or shooting ranges outside city limits. And in July, the city filed a formal motion with the Supreme Court, requesting that the case be dismissed as moot. The court denied the motion in October, setting the stage for another Second Amendment showdown.
In December’s oral arguments, the city again asked the court to moot the case. The city made no attempt to defend the transportation ban.
Unfortunately, given the city’s capitulation and the Supreme Court’s right-wing orientation, the only real remaining question is the scope of the NRA’s inevitable victory. Even if the court reconsiders the city’s request and enters a dismissal order, the NRA will walk away with a significant win, having forced the city to rescind one of the most stringent gun-control laws in the country. On the other hand, a decision on the merits on constitutional grounds in the NRA’s favor would reward the organization with an even bigger triumph, endangering gun-control laws everywhere.
A nation awash in firearms in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic awaits the court’s decision, which is expected by the end of June.

Closing the gender pay gap is not rocket science – even though recently graduated female rocket scientists earn 89 cents on the dollar to their male peers.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/heres-why-women-still-earn-a-lot-less-than-men/,alternet,gender,left,83.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"A decade ago, on Jan. 29, 2009, newly inaugurated President Barack Obama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.
It was the latest legislative effort to close the persistently stubborn gap between how much women and men earn. At the time, women made just 77 cents of every dollar men earned – a level that hadn’t improved all that much since the 1990s, according to Census data.
While existing laws already prohibited gender-based wage discrimination, the Ledbetter Act gave workers more time to sue employers over the issue. And the hope was that it would make a big difference.
So did it?
My research explores the legal hurdles that have prevented women from achieving pay equity with men. Now, 10 years after the act was passed, more work still needs to be done.
Ledbetter’s complaint
The Ledbetter Act overturned a Supreme Court case that ruled against Lilly Ledbetter, who worked as an area manager at Goodyear Tire and Rubber for more than 19 years. Over time, her pay slipped until she was earning 15 percent to 40 percent less than her male counterparts.
When an anonymous note tipped her off about the extent of the disparity, Ledbetter filed a pay discrimination complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a statute prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. A jury found in her favor and awarded more than US$3.5 million in damages.
The case was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which in 2007 ruled 5-4 that employees must file a complaint within 180 days after their employer makes a pay decision. The fact that the discrimination was embedded in each paycheck and that Ledbetter didn’t know of the disparity for many years did not matter. Time had run out on her claim.
In a vehement dissent read from the bench, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the ruling denied workplace realities. She pointed out that since employees often lack information about pay disparities, which can accumulate slowly over time, they shouldn’t be given such a narrow window in which to file a complaint.
Ultimately, the 111th Congress and President Obama agreed with Justice Ginsburg and nullified the decision. The Ledbetter Act makes clear that the statute of limitations for filing a wage discrimination claim resets with each discriminatory paycheck.
A disappointing impact
The law’s impact, however, has been disappointing.
The rate of new wage discrimination cases hasn’t budged, primarily because employees still lack information about their co-workers’ pay. Salary discussions are taboo in most workplaces, and some employers, like Ledbetter’s, forbid it.
Put simply, a woman can’t file a complaint if she doesn’t know she’s being shortchanged.
Title VII wage claims are hard to prove for other reasons too. Title VII generally requires proof that employers acted with discriminatory intent. However, much discrimination in today’s workplace is not intentional but fueled by unconscious gender stereotypes.
For instance, studies show that workers receive better performance evaluations when they conform to gender stereotypes, such as dominance for men and passivity for women. In one study, participants were asked to award merit-based bonuses to fictional employees with identical personnel files. Men got higher bonuses than women.
The bottom line: Women today earn about 80 cents for every dollar men make earn, up just a few cents since 2009.
And for women of color, the gap is even starker. Latinas earn 52 cents to the dollar of white men, while African-American women earn just 61 cents. Within racial groups, a pay gap between men and women persists, although it is narrower.
Narrow interpretations
Of course, employees who believe they are being discriminated against based on gender can also turn to the Equal Pay Act. This act, signed into law in 1963 when women earned only 60 cents for every dollar men earned, does not require a showing of employer intent to discriminate.
The act was the first to prohibit employers from paying men more than women who perform equal work.
The pay gap has since narrowed by about 20 cents, but not because of anti-discrimination laws. The main drivers have been women’s increased educational attainment and entry into the workforce.
The Equal Pay Act hasn’t been effective because courts read the law narrowly. They generally require that women plaintiffs identify a man with an identical job and resume for comparison. Given that men and women are tracked into different occupations, this can often be impossible.
Moreover, both Title VII and the Equal Pay Act allow employers to defend pay differentials on the basis of “any factor other than sex.” For example, courts have permitted a limitless array of employer excuses for paying women less that are themselves rooted in gender bias, such as women’s weaker salary bargaining skill, lesser management potential or lower prior salary history.
These statutory interpretations may sound technical, but they matter. They help explain why the gap appears stuck at 80 cents and why some estimate it’ll be at least until 2059 until pay equity in the United States is reached.
Why it persists
Another reason the gap is so stubborn is that men and women are steered into different occupations, and male-dominated occupations pay more for comparable work.
Even within a traditionally male field such as computer programming, women are paid less. And, as women move into a field, the entire occupation’s wages sink.
Importantly, economists have found that discrimination feeds as much as 38 percent of the gender gap.
Skeptics of the gender gap argue that it results from women’s choices to work fewer hoursand stay home to raise children.
It’s true, women bear a larger responsibility for child rearing and thus may cut back their hours or take time off from the workplace – especially because the United States is the only developed country without paid maternity leave and child care is expensive.
But while mothers face a “motherhood penalty” in opportunities and pay, fathers reap a “fatherhood bonus.”
And so-called “choices” cannot explain why female recent college graduates are paid 82 percent of their male counterparts or why the gap widens at the top. Professional women with advanced degrees who work full-time face a gender gap of 74 percent.
Closing the gender gap
Closing the gender pay gap is not rocket science – even though recently graduated female rocket scientists earn 89 cents on the dollar to their male peers.
Steps that would help include prohibiting employers from using salary history in setting wages, banning employer retaliation against employees who share wage information, providing greater transparency in pay, and revising Title VII and the Equal Pay Act to better address workplace realities.
The proposed Paycheck Fairness Act – introduced repeatedly in Congress since 1997 but never passed – would codify many of these remedies at the federal level. And the Trump administration suspended an Obama-era requirement that employers report extensive pay data.
While federal efforts stall, several states, including California, Oregon, Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey, have passed their own laws to close the gap.
The economic gains from closing the gender pay gap are huge. Doing so would add about $513 billion to the economy because of the extra income generated, reduce poverty and do a lot to support American families since mothers are the sole or primary breadwinners in about half of them.
Passing the Lilly Ledbetter Act was a start, and now we owe it to American workers to enact laws that close the gap once and for all.","['rocket', 'science']"

Pope Francis named the first woman to hold a high-ranking post in the Secretariat of State, the male-dominated Vatican's diplomatic and administrative nerve center.
Italian lay woman Francesca Di Giovanni, 66, will assume the newly-created post in a division known as the Section for Relations with States where she takes the rank of under-secretary, effectively one of two deputy foreign ministers.
The Roman Catholic Church allows only men to be ordained as priests and women have traditionally been consigned to the shadows of its administration.
However, women's groups, including the International Union of Superiors General (UISG), an umbrella group of Catholic nuns, have long called on the pope to appoint more females to senior jobs within the Vatican bureaucracy.

They cite figures showing that more than half of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics are women and that membership of female religious orders is about three times larger than male orders.
A Vatican statement confirming Di Giovanni's appointment said she would oversee multilateral relations in the secretariat where she has worked since 1993. Di Giovanni is a specialist in international law and human rights.
She told the official Vatican website Vatican News that her appointment was ""unprecedented"" though ""the responsibility is connected to the job, rather than to the fact of being a woman"".
She added: ""A woman may have certain aptitudes for finding commonalities, healing relationships with unity at heart. I hope that my being a woman might reflect itself positively in this task, even if they are gifts that I certainly find in my male colleagues as well.""
The Vatican, a sovereign state surrounded by Rome, has diplomatic relations with more than 180 countries.
Despite the pope's promises to appoint more women to decision-making jobs in the Vatican, Di Giovanni joins only about half a dozen others holding them.
The two most prominent are Barbara Jatta, head of Vatican Museums, and Cristiane Murray, deputy head of the press office.
Last year, Francis also appointed four women as first female councilors for the Synod of Bishops, a department founded more than 50 years ago that prepares major meetings of world bishops held every few years on a different topic.","['consigned', 'shadows']"

The white nationalist who said “Hail Trump” and “hail our people” during a conference in Washington D.C. on Saturday — and who received straight-armed Nazi-like salutes in response — told NBC News Monday that his comments were meant to be “cheeky,” “exuberant” and “ironic.”
The remarks from Richard Spencer, whose National Policy Institute was described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as one of the most influential purveyors of academic racism in the country, were published in a video by the Atlantic on Monday.

In response, some in the crowd, which had gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building and which the Atlantic estimated to be 200, saluted.

“There’s an ironic exuberance to it all,” Spencer claimed. ""I think that’s ... one of the things that makes the alt-right fun, is that we’re willing to do things that are a bit cheeky.”

"Whatever the specifics of what Donald Trump’s diagnosis may be, from the moment protesters started to hit the streets to denounce police brutality, one thing was certain: The president’s brainworms would direct his energies away from doing anything useful and toward the task of managing his ego, relying on the reality TV tricks he mistakes for the real work of presidenting.",https://www.alternet.org/2020/06/bunker-boy-trump-thinks-he-can-edit-reality-like-tv-show/,alternet,trump-presidency,left,84.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"Whatever the specifics of what Donald Trump’s diagnosis may be, from the moment protesters started to hit the streets to denounce police brutality, one thing was certain: The president’s brainworms would direct his energies away from doing anything useful and toward the task of managing his ego, relying on the reality TV tricks he mistakes for the real work of presidenting.
And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits.
Everything goes back to the original narcissistic injury from the past weekend: The “Bunker Boy” meme.
On Saturday, a group of protesters managed to tear down one of the barricades around the White House and, in response, the lights were turned off at the White House and Trump was reportedly hustled into an underground bunker by the Secret Service. This was shortly after Trump had tried to play-act the tough guy by tweeting lurid fantasies about how any protesters who breached the White House grounds would be “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”
That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny. Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it.
Both on social media and in protest signs, people called him “Bunker Boy” and contrasted Trump’s hiding with the behavior of former Vice President Joe Biden, who went out in the streets to talk to protesters instead of hiding from them.
It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes.
What Trump did on Monday has been well documented. That was when he made federal police tear-gas a crowd of peaceful protesters so that he could stage a photo-op in which he strode across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church and in front of its boarded-up doors, clutching a Bible. The decision to risk mass injury to civilians for a moronic campaign ad has generated a ton of outrage, but what takes the whole situation to the next level is that Trump clearly did because he was sick of people calling him a weenie for hiding in the bunker and thought this photo-op would make him look tough and majestic.
He did not, of course, look tough or majestic. He stood awkwardly in front of the church, wielding a Bible in a manner that suggested he had heard books described but never previously seen one. Meanwhile, the headlines and CNN chyrons informed the public that he had literally tear-gassed a crowd in order to walk across the square, underscoring what a massive chickens**t he is.
Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness.
Why did the chicken cross the road? So he could tear gas young peaceful protesters and get a photo-op with a book he’s never read. — David Rock (@dlrockstar) June 1, 2020
Trump is clearly incapable of learning the central lesson from this — which is that acting defensive always makes people laugh at you even harder. This is demonstrated by his refusal to let the whole thing drop. He keeps trying to defuse the “Bunker Boy” meme and the Lafayette Square debacle, and keeps making it worse.
On Tuesday, Trump attempted a re-do of the failed church photo-op, dragging the sullen-looking Melania Trump with him to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine for a public appearance that looked like a scene from a horror film. Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory broke with church protocol to criticize the visit, saying it was “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated,” adding that the late Pope John Paul II would not have condoned “the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate … for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.”
Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped.
These fumbling efforts to make “Bunker Boy” go away and frame himself as a tough but pious American leader-man unafraid to handle the current moment kept going on Wednesday. That was when Trump, clearly still smarting from all the mockery, tried to claim that he had not hunkered down in the bunker at all.
“I was there for a tiny, short little period of time,” Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, claiming he was not there for safety, but rather for an “inspection.”
It just so happened, Trump claimed that security “said it would be a good time to go down” to the bunker for the “inspecting factor” at the very same time that protesters just so happened to be tearing down the barricades. Interesting!
That lie is so transparent that it’s remarkable that even Donald Trump would think anyone would buy it. Then again, Trump has spent his entire life surrounded by people who nod and smile and agree with whatever dumb stuff he says, because they want money or power. That’s only gotten worse since he became our so-called president.
Meanwhile, Bunker Boy is bunking up his bunker even more, so he can hunker more better.

It’s been said a million times before, but it’s important to understand how much being the host on “The Apprentice” warped Trump’s already deeply disturbed mind. Trump is an imbecile and a failed businessman, but through the power of editing — apparently a mind-boggling amount of editing, considering how little they had to work with — the producers of “The Apprentice” were able to make him look somewhere close to a competent and credible businessman.
For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality.
This week amply demonstrated what Trump doesn’t understand: You can’t do reshoots and edits on the real world. Or as a great president to whom Trump often laughably compares himself, observed, you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
On “The Apprentice,” failed efforts to make Trump look good were simply deleted and reshot, until something was captured that the tireless video editors could bang into something passable.
But Trump’s bunker-hunker on Saturday, made worse by his cruel and stupid Lafayette Square photo-op on Monday, are just out there in the real world. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron.
The weirdest part about all this is that none of it makes any difference. Trump may think his followers are bamboozled into believing he’s a great man because of his production values, but that’s really not true. They’ll back him all the way because they share his reactionary views and feel he’s a useful tool to push America into fascism, not because they mistook him for someone who is either brave or noble.
Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end.","['brainworms', 'tricks', 'mistakes', 'real', 'ego']"
"But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society because they profit from the world as it is, not as it could be.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-climate-change-philanthropy-has-quite-few-hidden-strings-ncna1143791?cid=public-rss_20200228,msnbc,middle-class,left,85.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"On Feb. 17, Amazon CEO and occasional richest-man-in-the-world Jeff Bezos announced he was committing $10 billion — 7 to 8 percent of his massive fortune — to an initiative to combat climate change, dubbed the Bezos Earth Fund. Exactly how the funds will be distributed remains to be seen, but Bezos claims money will start flowing this summer in the form of grants to scientists, activists and nonprofit groups for ""any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world."" It's quite a reversal for the billionaire, who once declared, ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel.""
Bezos' change of heart aligns him with other powerful people. Last year, former Republican New York mayor and current candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Mike Bloomberg pledged $500 million to shut down coal plants across the United States. Goldman Sachs, the reviled investment bank, said it will invest $750 billion in ""sustainable finance projects"" over 10 years. And earlier this month, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has around $47 billion in its ever-growing endowment, added climate change to its philanthropic priorities.
It might seem that having wealthy individuals and multinational corporations promising so much money for climate initiatives would be a good thing. But it's much more complicated than just rich people trying to make the planet a better place. Anand Giridharadas, author of ""Winner Takes All,"" has emerged as one of the chief critics of this recent spate of billionaire philanthropy. Giridharadas writes that for all their talk of changing the world through charitable giving, what elites offer is a ""fake change"" that seeks ""to maintain the system that causes many of the problems they try to fix — and their helpfulness is part of how they pull it off. Thus their do-gooding is an accomplice to greater, if more invisible, harm.""

In practice, that means it's hard to trust Bezos' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal. Its push for ever-faster delivery times, as little as one to two days in parts of the country, also comes with an environmental cost.
Then there's the bigger question of why philanthropists are suddenly focusing on the environment. Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action. In the United States, President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, rolled back plenty of environmental regulations and opened Alaska's wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration, among other backward measures, but even officials at the lower levels of government aren't doing enough.
Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors is that government has failed to take bold action.
But U.S. officials are far from the only offenders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got some good press for implementing a carbon tax, but his government isn't on track to meet its Paris targets, either. Canada also nationalized a pipeline that would increase emissions and facilitate an expansion of Alberta's oil sands, and it is still dealing with crippling rail blockades after federal police forced indigenous land defenders out of the way of yet another pipeline. Meanwhile, politicians in Australia's right-wing government continue to oppose climate action, even in the face of record fires, and the European Union is funding new gas projects despite declaring a climate emergency.
But this lack of vision is not inherent to the public sphere. Rather, Giridharadas argues, it's the product of a broken system captured by notions of ""business fundamentalism"" and ""market worship,"" in which even those in the public sector believe that the capitalist class must chart the path forward. This is largely the product of a mindset promoted by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and brought into the Democratic Party by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which devalues the role of government in favor of the private sector.
In 2019, the 500 richest people in the world increased their wealth by $1.2 trillion, an increase of 25 percent in a single year. Also relevant: The richest 10 percent of people worldwide are responsible for nearly half of global emissions. Yet the tax rate paid by American billionaires fell below that of the working class in 2018 — and all their philanthropy actually reduces the tax they pay. Amazon, one of the most valuable companies in the world, paid no federal tax in 2018, instead receiving a $129 million tax refund.
That transfer of wealth has limited the ability of government to respond to social problems while increasing the economic power of billionaires. To some, that may seem like a good thing — we've been told for decades that the private sector is more efficient. But as Giridharadas says: ""There is enormous moral difference between five guys deciding to do something and a city deciding to do something. This is something I think you wouldn't have had to explain to people 100 years or 200 years ago when we actually had more faith in the idea of democratic action."" By leaving so much to billionaires, democracy is eroded.
The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations. In the past, large-scale social and economic transformations have always required government action, whether it was $500 billion to build the Interstate highway system, the creation of the Federal Housing Authority to subsidize homeownership and the suburbanization of the country or, as Sen. Bernie Sanders talked about recently at CNN's Nevada town hall, the restructuring of the U.S. economy to defeat fascism in World War II. These kinds of massive structural changes could not be accomplished by the private sector alone; Bezos' $10 billion wouldn't even cover the cost of New York City's Second Avenue Subway line, let alone a large-scale transformation of the entire country.
This is because, as Giridharadas writes, ""changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up."" That something is the power and wealth billionaires have derived from an economy that privileges growth at all costs and has caused inequality to soar and accelerated the climate crisis. But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society. They profit from the world as it is, not as it could be.
That's why billionaires' donations will never be enough. The highways, the suburbs and the victory against the Nazis — just to provide a few examples — are products not of the private sector but of government action. Through state spending, regulatory powers and the tax code, the government set the framework and priorities that businesses then responded to — and if we have any hope of cutting emissions in half by 2030, as the scientists tell us we need to do, we'll need the government to use its power to reset the rules once again.
The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place. For that, we need the government to redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables, change the tax code to penalize unsustainable industries, alter regulations to encourage denser development and ultimately set a framework that's more favorable to workers and communities that have been left behind these past few decades. That's why, regardless of what billionaires do, we need a Green New Deal to chart the path forward.",['profit']
"America is likely to remain a relative manufacturing wasteland, as barren as Trump’s own ill-conceived ideas on trade.",https://www.alternet.org/2019/09/trump-is-incapable-of-fixing-relations-with-china-and-his-trade-war-is-likely-to-grow-more-destructive/,alternet,international-politics-and-world-news,left,85.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"“Chimerica” is a term originally coined by the historian Niall Ferguson and economist Moritz Schularick to describe the growing economic relationship between the U.S. and China since the latter’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. In the words of Ferguson: “The Chinese did the saving, the Americans the spending. The Chinese did the exporting, the Americans the importing. The Chinese did the lending, the Americans the borrowing.” Much of the pre-crisis boom in global trade was driven by this economic symbiosis, which is why successive American presidents tolerated this marriage of convenience despite the increasing costs to the U.S. economy. The net benefits calculation, however, began to change after 2008, and the conflict has intensified further after the 2016 presidential election result. Today, the cumulative stress of Donald Trump’s escalating trade war is leading to if not an irreparable breach between the two countries, then certainly a significant fraying. The imminent resumption of trade talks notwithstanding, the rising cost of the tariffs is already inducing some U.S. manufacturers to exit China. But in most instances, they are not returning to home shores.
It may have taken Trump to point out the pitfalls of the Chimerica link, but coming up with a coherent strategy to replace it is clearly beyond the president’s abilities. America is likely to remain a relative manufacturing wasteland, as barren as Trump’s own ill-conceived ideas on trade. At the same time, it’s not going to be an unmitigated victory for China either, as Beijing is increasingly suffering from a large confluence of internal and external pressures.
Chimerica helped to launch China as a global trade power. To the extent that this marriage helped the U.S. economy, it skewed toward the largely blue state coastal regions. Wall Street banks located on the East Coast happily collected lucrative commissions and investment banking fees, as China’s export proceeds were recycled into U.S. treasuries, stocks, and high-end real estate while the capital markets boomed; on the West Coast, “new economy” companies thrived, their growth and profitability unhindered by the onslaught of Chinese manufactured exports. By contrast, facilitated by technological advances that permitted large-scale outsourcing by U.S. manufacturers, Chimerica laid waste to much of what was left of America’s Rust Belt, and the politics of many of the displaced workers mutated to the extent that Donald Trump became an appealing alternative to the establishment in 2016.
The major legacy of Chimerica, then, is that too many American workers have been semi-permanently replaced by low-cost offshored labor. Prior to great advances in technology, along with globalization, displacement of the current labor force could only have occurred through immigration of workers into the country. Historically, displacement by immigrants generally began at the menial level of the labor force, and became more restrictive as when it became correlated with significant unemployment. Given the rise of globalization and the corresponding liberalization of immigration in the past few decades, however, policy no longer arrests the displacement of American workers. The policy backlash has consequently manifested itself more via trade protectionism. Trump has sought to consolidate his Rust Belt base of supporters by launching a trade war, especially versus Beijing, the ultimate effects of which he hoped would be to re-domicile supply chains that had earlier migrated to China.
Early on in his presidency, there was some hope that Trump’s protectionism was at best a bluff or, at worst, an aberration, and that the return of a Democrat to the White House in 2020 would eventually reestablish the status quo ante. But the president still can’t get a wall, and his protectionism has become more pronounced almost as if to compensate. The problem today is that even if Trump is voted out of office in 2020, corporate America is becoming less inclined to wait out the end of his presidency to return to the pre-Trump status quo of parking the bulk of their manufacturing in China. There is too much risk in putting all of one’s eggs in the China basket, especially given growing national security concerns. Hence, U.S. companies are taking action. In spite of decades of investment in these China-domiciled supply chains, a number of American companies are pulling out: toy manufacturer Hasbro, Illinois-based phone accessories manufacturer Xentris Wireless, and lifestyle clothing company PacSun are a few of the operators who are exiting the country.
But they are not coming back to the U.S., relocating instead to places like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mexico, the Philippines and Taiwan. The chief financial officer of Xentris, Ben Buttolph, says that the company will never return to China: “We are trying to have multiple locations certified for all of our products, so that if all of a sudden there’s an issue with one of the locations, we just flip the switch.” Likewise, the CEO of Hasbro, Brian Goldner, recently spoke of “great opportunities in Vietnam, India and other territories like Mexico.”
All is not lost for the U.S., however, as Goldner did celebrate the success of Hasbro’s facility in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, which has resumed production of Play-Doh in the U.S. for the first time since 2004. It is doubtful, however, that this represents the recapturing of the high value-added supply chains that Trump envisaged when he first launched his trade assault on Beijing.
In general, as Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, writes: “United States industry is losing ground to foreign competitors on price, quality and technology. In many areas, our manufacturing capacity cannot compete with what exists in Asia.”
These are not isolated examples. Defense One also notes the following development:
“It came without a breaking news alert or presidential tweet, but the technological competition with China entered a new phase last month. Several developments quietly heralded this shift: Cross-border investments between the United States and China plunged to their lowest levels since 2014, with the tech sector suffering the most precipitous drop. U.S. chip giants Intel and AMD abruptly ended or declined to extend important partnerships with Chinese entities. The Department of Commerce halved the number of licenses that let U.S. companies assign Chinese nationals to sensitive technology and engineering projects.”
This development consequently makes it hard to proclaim Beijing a winner in this dispute either. The country still needs access to U.S. high tech. The government announced yet another fiscal stimulus to the economy earlier this month in response to a cluster of weakening economic data, much of which is related to the trade shock. It is also the case that China is being buffeted politically, both externally and internally: externally, in addition to the escalating trade war, China’s own efforts to counter the effects of rising protectionism by creating a “reverse Marshall Plan” via the Belt and Road Initiative is floundering. China’s “iron brother,” Pakistan, is increasingly being victimized by India’s aggressive Hindu-centric nationalism. It is hard to imagine the Modi government opportunistically taking the step of annexing Kashmir and undermining Pakistan, had it not sensed Beijing’s increasing vulnerability.
Internally, Beijing is finding it increasingly challenging as it seeks to enforce its “One China” policy in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The withdrawal of the controversial extradition law that first precipitated widespread demonstrations in Hong Kong has not alleviated the political pressures in the territory, but simply allowed an even bigger protest culture to take root and strengthen an independent political mindset. Similarly, Taiwan has also openly supported the Hong Kong protesters, pledging help to those seeking asylum. Both regions now constitute both a huge humiliation and challenge to the primacy of China’s ruling Communist Party. And now on top of that, foreign manufacturers are leaving the country, weakening a totally leveraged manufacturing complex.
The implications of this divorce go well beyond the U.S. and China. They constitute another step toward regionalization, another step away from a quaint ideological “post-history” construct that saw Washington, D.C., as the head office and the rest of the world as a bunch of branch plants for “America, Inc.” It’s hardly comforting to contemplate that the last time we reached this historic juncture was the early 1900s, when a similarly globalized economy broke down, followed by the Great War. As Niall Ferguson points out, “a high level of economic integration does not necessarily prevent the growth of strategic rivalry and, ultimately, conflict.” There’s no doubt that both Washington and Beijing will likely make soothing noises to the markets in order to create favorable conditions for the trade talks in October, but their actions suggest that they are both digging in for a longer struggle. Today’s trade wars, therefore, are likely to morph into something more destructive, which is a lose-lose in an era where human advancement depends on greater integration between economic powers.

"The president and his Republican brethren made all kinds of predictions about what would happen if their tax plan passed, and each of those predictions – from job creation to growth rates to the fiscal impact – turned out to be wrong.",http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/team-trump-claims-be-gearing-tax-cuts-20,msnbc,middle-class,left,85.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, Donald Trump announced that he and congressional Republicans were working “around the clock” on a new, “very major” tax cut, which would exclusively benefit the middle class, and which would be ready no later than Nov. 1. Even by his standards, the president’s claim was bizarre: lawmakers weren’t on Capitol Hill; there was no work being done on the issue; and even White House officials were “mystified” by Trump’s absurd rhetoric.
The whole endeavor, born of desperation, became an embarrassing fiasco for the president, but there was an underlying point of real significance: Trump and his allies realized that the American mainstream didn’t see the value of the regressive GOP tax plan, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations.
Republican leaders were ready for a second tax cut, in large part because the first one didn’t produce the intended results.
While Trump’s pre-election scheme was quickly exposed as a joke, his goal of another round of tax breaks was real. A few weeks ago, he again said he’s determined to “approve a major middle income Tax Cut” – possibly in 2021.
As Politico reported, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is eyeing tax cuts even earlier than that.
“I think there’s no question the U.S. economy is in very good shape. As we look around the world, there’s no question that China is slowing, Europe is slowing – the U.S. is the bright spot of the world,” Mnuchin told reporters. “And regards to a middle-class tax cut, you know, we’ll be looking at tax cuts 2.0, something that will be something we’ll consider next year,” he continued. “But right now, the economy is in very, very good shape.”
For now, let’s put aside the fact that every time top administration officials scramble to tell everyone how great the economy is, they sound a little less convincing. Let’s instead turn to the vague idea Mnuchin and his boss are excited about.
First, Team Trump’s credibility on the subject leaves much to be desired. The president and his Republican brethren made all kinds of predictions about what would happen if their tax plan passed, and each of those predictions – from job creation to growth rates to the fiscal impact – turned out to be wrong.
With a track record like that, it’s tough to take the same folks seriously when they say more of their failed idea will work wonders.
Second, I’m curious how, exactly, Team Trump intends to pursue “tax cuts 2.0.” The last time I checked, there’s a progressive House Democratic majority that probably won’t be too eager to go along with another dubious White House tax scheme. The president could try to unilaterally push a tax break by indexing the capital gains tax to inflation, but that would benefit the very wealthy – just like the “tax cuts 1.0.”
It’s a misguided plan, being pursued in a misguided way.",['wrong']

During the months-long Republican effort to tear down the Affordable Care Act, at no point did Donald Trump ever sit down for talks with congressional Democrats. This was neither an accident nor an oversight. As regular readers may recall , it was an open secret that Republicans were terrified of the prospect of the president negotiating directly with Democratic leaders.
The fear, of course, was that the amateur president would sit down Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, he’d find their pitch compelling, and Trump would end up giving Dems everything they asked for.
Similarly, about a year ago, White House officials balked at allowing Trump to hold private negotiations with proponents of a bipartisan immigration reform measure. Again, people close to the president, realizing that he didn’t know anything about the subject matter, and acknowledging the reality that the president was more interested in striking a deal than what the deal entailed, took great pains to prohibit one-on-one talks.
The likelihood of Trump being “tricked” into endorsing a good proposal was simply too high.
As the Republican president gets ready for another meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, those fears have risen anew. Politico reported the other day that White House officials believe it’s possible Trump will be “outfoxed” into giving away too much in Hanoi.
[Several] of the president’s top advisers] have expressed trepidation not only that the summit … may not yield big results. They worry, too, that Trump, eager to declare victory on the world stage, could make big concessions in exchange for empty promises of denuclearization. The push for a second summit came almost entirely from the president himself, according to current and former White House officials — but Trump remains undeterred. He has gushed about the “wonderful letters” he has received from Kim, as well as the “good rapport” he has developed with the North Korean leader and the enormous media coverage the event in Vietnam’s capital is likely to attract. Trump even bragged, in a phone call Tuesday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, that he is the only person who can make progress on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, according to a person briefed on the conversation, and complained about negative news coverage he has received.
There’s an implicit understanding that often goes unstated: everyone seems to quietly realize that Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. Worse, he doesn’t seem to care about his ignorance or incompetence – events like these are about “spectacle” – so the American leader makes no real effort to prepare for meetings such as these.
The Republican president entered the initial round of talks with the North Korean dictator in Singapore with minimal preparation – Trump went so far as to mock the very idea of doing pre-summit homework – and soon after, he made a series of concessions to Kim Jong-un in exchange for effectively nothing.
Will this round be any different? During a call with reporters last week, a senior administration official insisted, “The president is doing everything necessary to be well prepared for this summit.” Five minutes later, Trump began tweeting about an actor accused of orchestrating an attack against him for publicity. Soon after, he tweeted his support for a GOP senator’s re-election bid – 19 months before voters go to the polls.
The lack of focus didn’t inspire confidence.
What’s more, there’s little doubt that Pyongyang already sees the American leader as a man whose incompetence can be exploited. Bloomberg had a good report on these lines late last week:
“They do look to get President Trump in a room and see what they might get out of him,” said Christopher Hill, the North Korea negotiator under President George W. Bush. “If Singapore is any indication, the president seeks to want to negotiate everything himself.” Kim and his team seem to be betting on a repeat. A senior Trump administration official, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations, said North Korean officials have so far given little away in their meetings with the top U.S. envoy for the talks, Stephen Biegun. The official said the fear is that Kim will make an offer to Trump that sounds good at the moment, inspiring the president to sacrifice something in return that goes too far.
No modern White House had to worry about such things, largely because U.S. officials trusted their boss to be responsible and sensible during delicate negotiations.
In this administration, there’s a broad understanding that Donald Trump is … how do I put this delicately … different, and that creates an unsettling amount of uncertainty about what the president, desperate for progress, might give away to the dictator he claims to have fallen in love with.","['concessions', 'mock', 'minimal', 'preparation']"
"Biden spoke passionately Saturday night about handing out food to children and adults with his wife, Jill, and his grandchildren earlier in the day as he blamed President Donald Trump, who has proposed and begun to implement deep benefit cuts for federal subsidies benefiting the poor",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-camp-won-t-say-whether-he-stands-welfare-reform-n1132006?cid=public-rss_20200210,msnbc,middle-class,left,85.0,1.0,Biased,Somewhat factual but also opinionated,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign won't say whether he stands by his 1996 vote for welfare reform. That vote, and his failure to own it or disown it, could quickly become an additional anchor on his flagging campaign after Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary here.
Biden, who blamed President Donald Trump on Saturday for the depths of poverty in the state, is expected to finish well out of first place in the primary, and he will need to rebound in the more racially diverse states coming up next — Nevada and South Carolina — if he hopes to resurrect his hopes of winning the nomination.
But the welfare law has had a disproportionate effect on the fortunes of black and Latino families across the country, including among African Americans in many of the Deep South states key to Biden's long-term strategy.
The only other presidential candidate who was in Congress when the law was enacted, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., voted against welfare reform as a junior member of the House. That put Sanders on the same side as the overwhelming majority of black and Hispanic lawmakers.
Biden ""fought alongside right-wing Republicans to pass so-called 'welfare reform,'"" Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner wrote last month in an op-ed in South Carolina's The State newspaper, in which she accused Biden of having ""repeatedly betrayed black voters."" Sanders distanced himself from Turner, but the attack raised the prospect that the law will be revisited in the coming days.
A defining issue of its era, the bipartisan welfare reform compromise made massive changes to federal benefit programs for the poor, cut government spending and helped pave the way for President Bill Clinton's re-election by robbing Republican Bob Dole of a major issue.
The main title ended the Social Security Administration's cash-assistance entitlement program, Aid for Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC, and replaced it with the modern state block grant known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which has been capped at $17 billion annually ever since.
Nearly 25 years after Biden voted for it in the Senate, his campaign declined to say directly whether he stands by his vote.
Instead, a campaign spokesman e-mailed a long response to several questions posed by NBC News that explained the context of his position.
""When it became clear that welfare reform was going to move through Congress with bipartisan support — and with the support of the president — then-Senator Biden worked to make sure that the final bill reflected his progressive values by successfully maintaining funding for children's health and safety, supporting childcare, protecting Medicaid coverage for poor children, and preventing the block granting of Medicaid and Food Stamps,"" Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said in the message.

Biden voted for the final version after Clinton had vetoed two earlier attempts by congressional Republicans to enact measures with even deeper cuts to programs benefiting the poor. Biden's own alternative version of the bill, which was rejected by the Senate, included the provision replacing AFDC with TANF. Biden had previously voted for a non-binding measure expressing support for keeping AFDC as an entitlement, but he viewed that as a lost cause by the time the legislation was moving.
Gwin said Biden now wants to improve the country's social safety net if he wins the presidency.
""As President, Joe Biden will build on the successes of the Obama-Biden administration — like the Affordable Care Act — in strengthening and expanding our safety net and investing in disadvantaged communities by increasing Social Security benefits, tripling Title I funding for low-income schools, and implementing a host of other measures that will help ensure that Americans have an opportunity to work their way to the middle class and live with dignity,"" he said.
Biden spoke passionately Saturday night about handing out food to children and adults with his wife, Jill, and his grandchildren earlier in the day as he blamed President Donald Trump, who has proposed and begun to implement deep benefit cuts for federal subsidies benefiting the poor, for ""making it so much harder in this country.""
""To see them standing in line, huddled, no gloves, freezing to death, waiting to pick up a cardboard box, not able to pick it up, kicking it along the way so they could put bread in it, and they could put doughnuts in it,"" he said. ""Watching women, a woman, with barely a sweater on, with a child in her arms, holding her child tightly, and you could see the tears coming down her eyes as she picked up bread. ... God, I thought to myself, this is the United States of America.""

On one level, there is an echo of Biden's role in the Clinton crime bill in his support for welfare reform. Both were measures important to Clinton's re-election that pitted liberal Democrats against centrists at the time and have become even more controversial within the party in the years since. But there are key differences, too.
Unlike the crime bill, which got significant support from lawmakers of color, there was no ambiguity for black and Hispanic Democrats about welfare reform. On its final trip through the House back then, 44 black or Hispanic Democrats voted ""no,"" four voted ""yes"" and two did not vote. Sanders voted with the vast majority of black and Hispanic members.
""I am concerned because when many of those in this body speak of cutting destitute families off welfare, it is not really about the green buck but about the black face,"" Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in December 1995 as the debate was heating up.
The law passed by more than 3 to 1 in the House as all but three Republicans and exactly half the Democratic caucus voted for it. In the Senate, Biden was one of 24 Democrats to vote for the law, with 21 voting against it.
Since its enactment, supporters have heralded the law for cutting federal spending — which was mandated — and the length of welfare rolls. But critics say that the poor have suffered for restrictive eligibility requirements and that states, afforded more flexibility in their use of federal dollars, have often diverted them from the direct cash payments that helped families.
""When cash assistance disappears, what does this mean?"" said Ife Floyd, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities who studies family income support. ""Parents who have lost jobs or are fleeing domestic violence have less financial support to pay the rent, buy food or put gas in their car. They basically have less support to maintain stability after a crisis. And black families in need are more likely to experience that instability.""
The data show that both sides are right: Fewer poor families are getting federal aid.
""Nationally, TANF has provided less and less of support to families experiencing poverty since the program started in 1996,"" Floyd said. ""In 2018, the program served 22 families for every 100 in poverty, down from 68 in 1996.""
Gwin, the Biden spokesman, also declined to say directly whether Biden believes TANF has been successful in place of AFDC.
But Michael Moore, a close friend of Sanders who often speaks at his campaign rallies, spoke to NBC News about the issue outside the New Hampshire Democratic Party's McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club dinner in Manchester on Saturday night.
""It was cruel,"" Moore said of the law, which was enacted when he was living in Flint, Michigan, where poverty rates have been persistently high.
He said Biden was ""not getting the right advice"" on how to address his record.
""It's OK to say, 'I voted for it for this reason, we needed the money for this specific purpose, whatever,'"" Moore said. ""That's all Biden has to say. I think he's a good guy. He has a good heart.""
Biden has relied so far on Democrats' believing that his values line up with theirs, even though much of his record is out of step with the party's modern platform. At a time when income inequality, generational poverty and racial disparities are all animating issues for party voters, it's hard to imagine that he will be able to go much further without taking a position on his own welfare reform vote.","['passionately', 'blamed']"
In every case legislators are being swarmed by right-wing activists who don’t hesitate to use deceit and hysteria to stop Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratification from happening.,https://www.alternet.org/2019/04/republicans-want-to-make-sex-discrimination-legal-and-theyre-moving-fast/,alternet,gender,left,85.0,1.0,Biased,Expresses writer’s opinion,"There are many reasons that Republicans and conservative activists love Donald Trump, but among the top must be that he makes it much easier for them to enact their wildly unpopular agenda. Trump’s all-consuming ability to grab the headlines and dominate news coverage creates an opportunity for the far right to push for its regressive agenda, safe in the knowledge that such efforts (understandably) will get little attention from a media addicted to the Trump Show.
Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to the conservative battle to make sex discrimination legal. This fight is a particularly difficult one for the right, politically speaking. While Americans still cling to sexist gender roles at home, overwhelming majorities believe that sex discrimination in public spaces should be illegal. So conservative activists are turning to their favorite weapons — bad faith and distraction — to advance an agenda of gender inequality.
On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to analyze the possibility of amending the U.S. Constitution so that it explicitly bars discrimination based on sex. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) simply states that that equal rights cannot be denied “on account of sex.” It was first introduced in 1923, but ratification of it became a serious issue in the 1970s, when feminist activists began convincing states to ratify it. They got famously and tantalizingly close, falling just three states short of ratification before hitting a 1982 deadline created by Congress.
While many have long assumed the ERA is forever dead, like Jon Snow, it’s rising again. Two more states have ratified the amendment and now activists are arguing that the deadline set by Congress in the 70s is invalid, since the Constitution doesn’t give Congress that power. Tuesday’s hearing was focused on this question: If a 38th state ratifies the ERA, what can and should happen next?
“A few years ago, a great woman, a great person, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was asked in an interview what amendment she would most like to see added to the United States Constitution,” said Rep. Stephen Cohen, D-Tenn., during his opening remarks at Tuesday’s hearing. “She answered it would be the Equal Rights Amendment.”
But while conservative activists’ efforts have largely flown under the radar, it’s safe to say they have pulled out all the stops in their fight to keep the ERA out of the Constitution, and in fact to roll back existing protections against sex discrimination that progressives have already secured.
One flank of the attack is focused on the states. A number of state legislatures are looking at the possibility of becoming the 38th (and deciding) state to ratify the ERA, and in every case legislators are being swarmed by right-wing activists who don’t hesitate to use deceit and hysteria to stop this from happening.
In April in Missouri, anti-feminist activists leaned heavily on Republican legislators, using the scare word “abortion” in order to stoke opposition to equal rights. And sure enough, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Dave Schatz, came out against the ERA, saying that the “majority of this [amendment] is about abortion” and claiming that Jesus would oppose it. (Jesus’ known positions on issues of human equality would suggest otherwise.)
Virginia came within a hair of ratifying the ERA, but because the 2017 state elections were so close that the Republicans literally held their legislative majority by a coin toss, the ratification was killed. Once again, anti-abortion hysterics played a major role in the fight, with conservatives falsely accusing Democrats of wanting to legalize infanticide, all as part of a sexist campaign to demonize any effort to secure equality for women.
Even during Tuesday’s federal congressional hearing, Republicans were at it again. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., warned that “the people’s right to protect the unborn would be eliminated if the ERA was to pass,” and argued that women’s equality should not be enshrined in the Constitution lest it damage the ability of conservatives to meddle in women’s medical care access.
But, as Kamala Lopez of Equal Means Equal and legal expert Wendy Murphy told Salon, the legislative fights are only part of the picture. They expressed concern about a series of cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear that are billed as LGBTQ cases in the media, but, legally speaking, are also about the issue of sex discrimination.
The three cases, which will be bundled into one before the Supreme Court, all involve LGBTQ workers being fired for their identity. In two cases, the workers were fired for being gay and in the third, a woman was fired for being trans. The court is expected to examine whether or not these firings constitute sex discrimination that violates both state laws and the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The pro-LGBTQ side is arguing that this case is covered by a precedent set in 1988, when the Supreme Court decided it was a form of illegal sex discrimination to penalize employees for failing to perform their gender in a way that pleases their bosses. In that case, a woman was able to successfully argue that her employer had discriminated against her by denying her a promotion unless she learned to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear makeup, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.” Forcing employees to conform to gender stereotypes, the court decided, was in itself a form of sex discrimination.
LGBTQ advocates argue that if employers expect employees to be straight, or to adhere to a gender identity assigned at birth, that is a form of gender stereotyping that should, under this precedent, be illegal. Many feminist legal experts worry that if the court rules against the LGBTQ employees in these cases, it will not only set back LGBTQ rights but will also make it easier to discriminate against women on a much larger scale.
“These cases are designed to strike at the very heart of the law’s understanding of what it means to discriminate against someone because of their sex or their gender,” Imani Gandy, a legal expert at Rewire, explained in a recent “Boom! Lawyered” podcast. She goes on to note that a hostile decision in this case could lead to “firing a gay man for not being sufficiently ‘macho'” or to employers paying women less “because of a belief that men should be the heads of households.”
(Full disclosure: My partner, Marc Faletti, is executive producer of the “Boom! Lawyered” podcast.)
As Murphy explained in a follow-up email to Salon, she believes part of the reason the Supreme Court is taking the case now is part of a conservative divide-and-conquer strategy. Unfortunately, some feminist organizations have been reluctant to back a robust definition of “sex discrimination” that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. So these cases create an opportunity to chip away at progressive solidarity between these causes and weaken the movement against sex discrimination overall.
Whether in the courts or the legislatures, the right is pursuing an elaborate strategy to attack women’s equality and preserve sex discrimination by coming at the issue sideways. Instead of flatly admitting to opposing women’s legal equality, conservatives are hiding behind more provocative or “controversial” issues such as abortion rights or trans rights, which are less politically popular than the ERA, as a way of derailing efforts to fight sex discrimination.
Conservatives also know they have to move fast. Support for both abortion rights and LGBTQ equality are rising, making it harder to exploit the controversies around both to undermine women’s equality. That’s why the right is seizing this moment to step up efforts to stop the ERA and undermine existing protections against sex discrimination. Anti-equality activists understand they might not have another chance.","['deceit', 'hysteria', 'swarmed', 'right-wing']"
