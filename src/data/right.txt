Topic: trump-presidency
Opinion:Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary.<|end_of_text|>

Opinion:What we can expect from Bezos’s $10 billion, in other words, is $10 billion worth of green bullshit spread liberally around the world, scaring impressionable school kids, colonising university departments, misleading the mainstream media, granting shyster politicians the excuse they need to raise taxes and introduce more regulations in the name of ‘saving the planet.’<|end_of_text|>

Topic: elections-2020
Opinion:While falling short of calling half the nation “deplorable” as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did in 2016, the comments echo a deep disdain for a large population of the country increasingly perpetuated by left-wing elites in the wake of the George Floyd protests characterizing the U.S. as irredeemably racist.<|end_of_text|>
